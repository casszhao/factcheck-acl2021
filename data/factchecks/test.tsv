false	in early march 2020 , a number of social media users posted a video of a genuine shoplifting incident in san francisco , california , along with commentary that the incident was evidence of “ radical left ” leadership that led to lenient policies that were responsible for the crime . <PARA> specifically , some claimed the crime was the result of some unspecified “ no arrest ” policy in the city of san francisco . others stated the incident was the upshot of california proposition 47 , a 2014 ballot measure that , among other reforms , created a new penal code for shoplifting that didn ’ t exist before , classifying it as a misdemeanor if the dollar amount stolen was less than $ 950 . <PARA> both claims are false . <PARA> we contacted the san francisco police department ( sfpd ), and a spokesman there said the shoplifting incident was real and occurred about 1 p . m . on feb . 29 , 2020 . employees at the walgreens drugstore where it occurred told police that three females , possibly minors , took “ several cosmetic items ,” then fled before police arrived . the investigation remains open and no arrests have been made . <PARA> san francisco police officer robert rueca said that sfpd doesn ’ t have a “ no arrest ” policy . “ if we have the probable cause to believe that someone has committed a crime , we will arrest the suspects and present that case to the district attorney ,” rueca said in an email to snopes . <PARA> it ’ s also a mischaracterization of events to claim the crime was allowed to occur because of purported leniency resulting from prop 47 . <PARA> <MEDIA> <PARA> a person who is accused of committing any misdemeanor can be arrested and face jail time under california state law . shoplifting in the state is punishable by up to six months in county jail . shoplifting is defined under california law as “ entering a commercial establishment with intent to commit larceny while that establishment is open during regular business hours , where the value of the property that is taken or intended to be taken does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($ 950 ).” <PARA> prop 47 , which california voters approved in 2014 , reclassified some minor crimes as misdemeanors instead of felonies , with the intent of reducing what was at the time a severely overcrowded prison population . the aim was also to reduce the number of people serving long sentences and ending up with felony - conviction records for petty crimes . <PARA> prop 47 increased the felony threshold for certain types of theft from $ 450 to $ 950 — meaning the simple theft of property valued below $ 950 is a misdemeanor . it also reduced simple drug possession ( possession of drugs without the intent to sell ) to a misdemeanor . the claim that prop 47 is to blame for the incident depicted in the video is representative of misinformation that has been circulating about the law for years , said george gascón , the former district attorney of san francisco who is now running for the same position in los angeles county and who co - authored prop 47 . <PARA> although the threshold for misdemeanor - versus - felony theft prior to prop 47 was $ 450 , it ’ s unclear whether the new law makes any potential difference in the san francisco case . in the video , the thieves are seen stuffing drugstore - brand cosmetics into bags . it ’ s unknown how much the items were worth — sfpd would not give us an estimate . <PARA> “ prop 47 doesn ’ t cover robberies , theft by the use of force or fear . it doesn ’ t cover burglaries ,” gascón said . “ if you break into a structure with the intent to commit theft or another felony , that continues to be a felony . if someone breaks into your car to steal even a pack of cigarettes , that ’ s still a felony . even the crimes that are covered by prop 47 , they were not decriminalized . we moved them from a felony to a misdemeanor . [ perpetrators ] can still go to county jail ” if they are convicted . <PARA> the claim that increasing the value of shoplifted property to meet a felony threshold is contributing to a rash of crime in california is spurious , given that other states have higher thresholds ( texas ’ felony threshold , for instance , is $ 2 , 500 ). a 2018 pew research study found that states that increased thresholds to account for inflation did not see a resulting uptick in crime as a result . <PARA> gascón said that when crafting prop 47 , he and his co - authors purposely looked at felony thresholds in red states . states like texas and tennessee “ had significantly higher thresholds between felonies and misdemeanors ,” gascón told us . <PARA> part of the intent behind prop 47 was to deal with inequality embedded in the system , gascón said . for example , crack possession used to be a felony while possession of drugs like methamphetamines and cocaine were what were known as “ wobblers ,” he said , which is jargon for crimes that prosecutors had some discretion to charge either as misdemeanors or felonies . racial discrepancies existed in terms of who was most likely to have those drugs ; african americans , for instance , were more likely to be charged with felony drug possession than whites were , he said . <PARA> prop 47 was also intended to address severe overcrowding in california ’ s prisons and meet a federal court order to alleviate it . in 2011 , the u . s . supreme court ruled that overcrowding in the state ’ s prison system was unconstitutional . prop 47 succeeded in helping the state reach key benchmarks by reducing low - level , non - violent offenses like drug possession , petty theft , and writing bad checks to misdemeanors so long as the amounts in question did not exceed $ 950 . the effect was a decrease in the prison population and also a reduction in recidivism . <PARA> a 2018 study conducted by the university of california at irvine found no evidence that prop 47 resulted in an increase in crime . meantime , violent crime and property crime in california remain at historic lows . <PARA> in summary , the claim that a “ no arrest policy ” exists in san francisco appears to be made up . we also found no evidence that a change in california state law in regards to misdemeanor shoplifting directly contributed to this incident . we therefore rate this claim “ false .”	
true	law enforcement officials who work in an undercover capacity often run the risk of being placed in danger if those they ’ re trying to fool learn their true identities . but sometimes undercover cops can inadvertently put themselves in harm ’ s way by playing their roles too well , as suggested in the following meme : <PARA> this farce played out on detroit ’ s east side in november 2017 , although it wasn ’ t quite as simple as the above meme , and several news accounts , made it sound . <PARA> special - operations officers from detroit ’ s 11th precinct were preparing to execute a search warrant on a suspected drug house , but unbeknownst to them , cops from the department ’ s 12th precinct were operating within the 11th precinct ’ s territory . this intersection of two different groups of police who had not coordinated with or made their presence known to each other set the stage for chaos . <PARA> first , two special - ops officials from the 11th precinct encountered two undercover cops from the 12th precinct who were posing as drug dealers , and the former attempted to detain the latter . then , while 11th precinct officers were executing their search warrant on the suspected drug house , a separate team of cops from the 12th precinct stormed into the house before it could be secured , triggering a confused brawl between the two groups : <PARA> footage from one of the officers ’ body cameras captured part of the fracas between the two groups of officers : <PARA> according to one report , the incident involved two dozen police officers altogether , one of whom was taken to a hospital : <PARA> contrary to the wording of the meme presented above , we found nothing documenting that undercover police from the 11th precinct were “ posing as drug buyers .” a couple of 11th precinct officers unknowingly encountered undercover cops from the 12th precinct who were posing as drug dealers and attempted to detain them , but the former were on the scene because they were part of a group of officers attempting to execute a search warrant on a suspected drug house , not because they were engaged in an undercover operation that had them posing as drug buyers .	
true	at the time of this writing , donald trump is president of the united states , former mayor michael bloomberg is a 2020 democratic presidential candidate , former mayor and trump attorney rudy giuliani is embroiled in a scandal that led to trump ’ s impeachment , and former president bill clinton is married to one of trump ’ s chief political foes , former secretary of state hillary clinton . knowing all that , it would seem odd to see these four men golfing together in 2020 . <PARA> and yet , a photograph supposedly showing trump , bloomberg , giuliani , and bill clinton on the golf course circulated widely on social media attached to a quote from comedian george carlin : “ it ’ s a big club , and you ain ’ t in it .” <PARA> this is a genuine ( and cropped ) photograph of trump , giuliani , bloomberg , and clinton on the golf course . it was taken in 2008 at the trump national golf club in briarcliff manor , new york , during the joe torre safe at home foundation golf classic . the uncropped photograph , which was taken by sabo robert and is available via getty images , also pictured comedian billy crystal and former baseball manager joe torre . <PARA> trump and bloomberg also golfed together at this event in 2007 . <PARA> some viewers had trouble picturing trump , a future republican president , golfing with high - profile democrats like clinton and bloomberg . others viewed this image in the context of carlin ’ s quote and interpreted the photograph as proof that the lines between the leading u . s . political parties aren ’ t as distinct as they appear to be . <PARA> while there are certainly differences between republicans and democrats , we ’ ll note that trump , giuliani , and bloomberg have all switched parties at least once in their careers . this isn ’ t entirely uncommon , however , especially when one ’ s political career spans decades . <PARA> the viral photograph truly shows trump , bloomberg , clinton and giuliani golfing together at an event in 2008 . whether or not the photograph shows the “ big club ” that you “ ain ’ t in ” is up to the viewer to decide . here ’ s a segment of the carlin routine from which the quote originated :	
true	on oct . 10 , 2019 , u . s . president donald trump held a campaign rally in minneapolis , minnesota , during which he dissed some popular musicians , claiming that they had been used by hillary clinton to artificially inflate the crowd size at her presidential campaign events : <PARA> afterwards , occupy democrats posted a meme that quoted springsteen as saying “ we ’ re living in a frightening time . the stewardship of the nation has been thrown away to somebody who doesn ’ t have a clue as to what that means . trump doesn ’ t have a grasp of what it means to be an american ”: <PARA> that statement was correctly attributed to springsteen and was taken from a two - part october 2019 interview the musician sat for with “ cbs this morning ” to promote his concert film “ western stars ”: <PARA> here ’ s a video excerpt of springsteen ’ s remarks from that “ cbs this morning ” appearance :

false	when readers first came across a biological weapon named “ wuhan - 400 ” in dean koontz ’ s novel “ the eyes of darkness ,” we doubt anyone had the notion that the famous thriller author was “ predicting ” a real - world outbreak of covid - 19 , coronavirus disease . but in february 2020 , after such an outbreak had occurred , eagle - eyed koontz fans shared this passage as if the famous thriller author was a prognosticator . <PARA> this is a genuine page from the novel “ the eyes of darkness .” the passage can be seen in amazon ’ s preview of a mass market paperback edition of this novel that was released in december 2008 . <PARA> it ’ s true that koontz named a fictional biological weapon “ wuhan - 400 ” in this novel . it ’ s also true that wuhan , china , is the city at the center of the 2020 coronavirus outbreak . however , that ’ s pretty much where the similarities end . <PARA> here are a few things this “ prediction ” gets wrong : <PARA> but there ’ s more bad news for this prediction . <PARA> while the page from koontz ’ s novel displayed above is genuine , other iterations of this book used a different name for the fictional biological weapon . in fact , when we searched a 1981 edition of this book available via google books we found no references to “ wuhan .” in that edition , this biological weapon is called “ gorki - 400 ” after the russian city where it was created . <PARA> we ’ re not entirely sure when or why this change occurred . from what we can tell , the biological weapon was originally called “ gorki - 400 ” when this book was published in 1981 . but by 2008 , the name had been changed to “ wuhan - 400 .” <PARA> regardless of when “ wuhan - 400 ” made its way into koontz ’ novel , this is not a prediction . koontz did not claim that the events that took place in his novel would later come to fruition , and the similarities between “ wuhan - 400 ” and covid - 19 are minimal . furthermore , readers only noticed this “ prediction ” after an outbreak of coronavirus was reported in wuhan , china , which makes this “ prediction ” nothing more than a coincidence .

false	warning : this article contains a video that shows a recently deceased person . as such , it may not be suitable for all viewers . <PARA> in february 2020 , a video supposedly showing a chaotic scene in wuhan , china , was widely shared on social media with the suggestion that it was related to the 2020 outbreak of a new coronavirus . <PARA> actor james woods posted the video to his twitter account , asking if anyone knew what was actually going on in this footage : <PARA> although the video attached to woods ’ tweet was later removed , at the time of this writing it was still viewable on other twitter posts . <PARA> while the video was widely shared as if it showed a singular incident , it was actually made up of three individual and unrelated clips , which we evaluate separately below . <PARA> are these armed doctors ? <PARA> rating : miscaptioned . <PARA> the first clip in this video was widely shared along with the unfounded claim that it showed medical professionals armed with weapons . the implication here appears to be that doctors are killing patients as opposed to treating them . however , this video appears to show police officers dressed in medical gear , not medical professionals . <PARA> while we have not been able to find the source of this video , getty images does have a few photographs of police officers in wuhan , china , wearing similar protective clothing . furthermore , the word “ police ” can be briefly seen on the hood of this car . <PARA> are these gunshots being fired to deter people from leaving quarantine ? <PARA> rating : miscaptioned . <PARA> the second clip in this video was widely shared as if it showed doctors treating coronavirus patients on the street as gunshots could be heard in the background . one twitter user wrote : <PARA> there was no evidence to support speculation that the blasts in the background were gunshots , that these gunshots were being fired to prevent people from fleeing the area , or that people laying in the streets are coronavirus victims . <PARA> nobody can be seen on screen holding a gun , and the people shown in the video do not seem particularly disturbed by the supposed “ gunfire .” this video also started circulating on or around jan . 25 , 2020 , when china was celebrating lunar new year . one early posting of this footage noted that the explosions in the background were fireworks from the holiday celebration . <PARA> was a woman shot dead after attempting to break through a coronavirus blockade ? <PARA> rating : miscaptioned . <PARA> the final clip in this video supposedly shows a woman who was “ shot dead after she attempted to break the blockade set up to contain # coronavirus .” <PARA> this is a genuine video . however , it is not related to the coronavirus nor to a roadblock . this video actually shows a person who was killed in a motorbike accident . <PARA> remnants of this accident can be seen in the video . at one point , a busted up sidewalk can be seen near the victim . an overturned scooter can also be seen in the background . the french news outlet les observateurs france 24 obtained a slightly longer version of this video that more clearly shows the crashed motorbike . <PARA> les observateurs also obtained a statement from the director of the wuzu police station who said that this was a “ one - vehicle road accident ”: <PARA> in summary <PARA> although wuhan , china , and surrounding areas were certainly dealing with an outbreak of coronavirus in early 2020 , and while some of the photographs and videos coming out of china are undoubtedly real , many clips have been captioned in a way to capitalize on the fear of this potential pandemic . <PARA> when we examined another set of videos that supposedly showed people collapsing in the street as a result of contracting coronavirus , for instance , we found that these claims were based purely on the spectator ’ s assumptions and not any first - hand knowledge . the world health organization said that it would be “ atypical ” for people to collapse in this manner from the virus . <PARA> find more information on coronavirus here .

false	in the early days of snopes . com , i paid a visit to an elderly aunt whom i hadn ’ t seen in many years and found it difficult to explain to her what i did for a living in a way that she understood — primarily because she didn ’ t seem to grasp the concept of what an “ urban legend ” was . i searched my memory for an example of an urban legend that she would recognize , and recalling the time and place where she grew up ( i . e ., the east coast in the 1930s ), i asked her , “ do you remember uncle don ?” <PARA> her face immediately lit up . she started to say , “ i was listening the day when ...” <PARA> my aunt didn ’ t need to finish that sentence for me to know what she was referring to , of course . nor did she need to say anything more for me to know that she was about to regale me with her personal reminiscence of witnessing an event that never took place . <PARA> the “ uncle don ” legend was the seminal cautionary tale of the mass communications era ushered in by the advent of broadcast radio , a technology that created the potential for an injudicious remark uttered in an unguarded moment to be heard in real time by thousands of persons geographically remote from the speaker — with potential career - ending consequences : <PARA> versions of this tale were familiar to many americans in the mid - 20th century , typically told by someone who claimed to have heard the infamous broadcast themselves , or who had an older friend or relative who did . at the very least , most everyone knew someone who recalled the national uproar caused by the incident or remembered reading about the firing of the hapless host in the newspaper . <PARA> this legend seems to have been attributed , at one time or another , to virtually everyone who had ever hosted a show for youngsters on radio or television . adults who grew up in america during the years of radio ’ s prominence between the world wars tended to name whichever local children ’ s host they listened to or were most familiar with as the culprit . those who grew up after television became a fixture in american households were more likely to identify one of the many ubiquitous kiddie tv personalities as the guilty party . <PARA> in one of his popular books of urban legends , folklorist jan harold brunvand provided a prime example of this phenomenon . after devoting a few pages on the legend to letters debunking the notion that this incident took place on a “ bozo the clown ” television show , brunvand offered his own recollections : “ to tell the truth , i always thought that the host of my own favorite kids ’ radio show , ‘ happy hank ’ ( heard in lansing , michigan , mid - 1940s ), had spoken these naughty words into a live mike .” <PARA> despite the wide variety of radio and television hosts with whom this legend has been associated , over the years one name has been connected with the alleged incident more often and more prominently than any other : don carney , known to millions of pre - television youngsters as “ uncle don .” <PARA> as broadcast radio rapidly gained in popularity during the early 1920s , commercial stations began creating programming specifically for children , leading to the rise of numerous radio “ uncles ,” “ aunts ,” and “ brothers ,” hosts who related stories and songs and acted out skits with regular characters they invented for a largely preschool audience . these shows typically aired in the hours after school , on saturday mornings , and in the early weekday evenings . by far the longest - lived and most well known of these children ’ s hosts was “ uncle don ” carney of station wor , whose show aired throughout a seven - state area including metropolitan new york six days a week for 21 years . <PARA> don carney , born howard rice in 1897 , hailed from st . joseph , michigan . he left home to join the circus as an acrobat and ended up in vaudeville , where , at age 15 , he began using the stage name of don carney while performing stock irishman parts . he traveled throughout the midwest , performing in various stock and repertory companies before gaining minor notoriety as a trick pianist who could play while standing on his head . after bouncing from job to job and state to state , carney eventually made his way to new york , where he obtained employment at radio stations wmca and wor , working as an announcer , vocal handyman , and stand - by pianist . <PARA> when a toy manufacturer came to wor one day looking for a children ’ s show to sponsor , carney was tapped to audition for them . the routine he threw together in a few hours impressed the sponsors , and don carney soon embarked upon a new career as the beloved kiddie host “ uncle don .” his children ’ s show made its debut in september 1928 and ran for nearly two decades ( until february 1947 ), airing six nights a week monday through saturday . ( at various times carney also read the funnies to his audience of youngsters on sunday mornings .) uncle don ’ s program was a combination of original stories and songs , jokes , advice , personal messages , birthday announcements , and club news , woven around numerous commercial messages . <PARA> even before we begin a discussion of any potential factual basis for this legend , we can already determine that the repercussion aspect of the legend — the claim that uncle don was fired ( and , in some versions , replaced with a sound - alike ) in response to his alleged careless remark — is clearly false . <PARA> don carney broadcast day in and day out , six and sometimes seven days a week , starting in 1928 and ending only when he finally stepped down from daily broadcasting in 1947 . ( even then , he continued on with wor as a dj devoted to playing children ’ s records before moving to miami beach in 1948 and hosting a weekly children ’ s show on wkat until his death in 1954 .) his show was never canceled , and he was never taken off the air or relieved of his job for any period , until his daily spot was finally discontinued by wor in 1947 . don carney was never penalized for anything he said as an on - air radio personality . <PARA> we also note that not a single contemporaneous account of don carney ’ s supposed involvement in a “ bastard ” scandal appeared in any major news or trade publication of the day . the only articles linking the name of uncle don to this tale did not report it as current or recent news , but rather recounted the incident in the latter years of his career as an occurrence that had purportedly taken place at some indeterminate time in the past ( a typical pattern for print accounts of apocryphal events ). <PARA> in fact , we know that this uncle don “ bastards ” rumor is false , and we know exactly how it became associated with don carney . it was an extant legend told about a number of different children ’ s show “ uncles ” and “ big brothers ” in the early days of broadcast radio , and — in true urban legend fashion — when uncle don eventually became the most famous exemplar of that form of radio host , the story gravitated to , and became permanently attached to , him . <PARA> we know this because in may 1928 , several months before don carney debuted as “ uncle don ,” the very same story appeared on the front page of the los angeles examiner , related in a first - person account by a “ radio station big brother ” identified only as “ j . k .”: <PARA> and within a few years ( april 1930 ), the very same story was published in the entertainment industry trade publication variety , once again attributed to a unidentified children ’ s radio host who was clearly not uncle don . ( carney broadcast out of new york and not philadelphia .) readers at the time would have assumed the announcer referenced here was most likely christopher graham , known in philadelphia as uncle wip : <PARA> note the many aspects of implausibility to this item . it bears a curious lack of detail for a news report of an event that supposedly happened only “ two weeks ago ”: no specific host was named , no particular radio station was identified , and no date was provided , even though the incident was supposedly quite recent . moreover , it posits that telegrams of protest allegedly started arriving at the radio station “ within 10 minutes ,” as if the show ’ s listeners ( including members of the federal radio commission , who apparently had the facilities and staff to monitor every single program on the air ) lived within yards of a telegraph office and had nothing better to do that evening than pop out the door and dash off telegrams of complaint . <PARA> unfortunately , once the “ little bastards ” rumor was attached to don carney , it clung there tenaciously for the rest of his life ( and beyond ), reinforced by manifestly false accounts which supposedly documented something that never took place . for example , the following narrative appeared in sidney skolsky ’ s syndicated entertainment column “ hollywood is my beat ” on july 24 , 1957 : <PARA> on the surface , this would appear to be a fairly credible account of the incident in question . it comes from someone purportedly in the broadcasting business , working at the same station as uncle don , and it describes a fairly specific time and place of occurrence ( even if it does rely upon the amazingly fortuitous circumstance of the claimant ’ s just happening to be in precisely the right spot , at just the right time , to witness the event ). <PARA> however , this account leaves us puzzled as to how a “ nation - wide reaction ” could have taken place yet remain unreported in any major newspaper , magazine , or trade publication of the time . where , then , did this national reaction play out ? moreover , a check of the radio listings in the new york times from the winter of 1928 - 29 reveals that oliver sayler ’ s “ footlight and lamplight ” radio program didn ’ t , as he claimed , follow uncle don ’ s show , but preceded it . (“ footlight and lamplight ” aired after the news at 6 : 15 p . m .; uncle don was on the air from 6 : 30 to 6 : 55 p . m .) how , then , did sayler come to be in the studio at the conclusion of uncle don ’ s program , as he claimed he was ? <PARA> despite the occasional attempts to perpetuate it in newspaper columns , this rumor might have significantly declined in prevalence after don carney ’ s death ( or at least been less frequently associated with his name ) were it not for a series of popular “ blooper ” records that rekindled public awareness of the legend . starting the mid - 1950s , writer and producer kermit schafer began compiling several albums of alleged boners , fluffs , and outtakes from radio and tv and issuing them in record jackets deceptively claiming that the recordings contained within were “ authentic .” <PARA> although the “ bloopers ” records led listeners to believe that they were hearing actual recordings of broadcast blunders , much of what schafer presented actually consisted of fabricated “ re - creations ” based on ( often apocryphal ) secondhand sources . in this vein , vol . 1 of the “ blooper ” series presented uncle don front and center , in a clip of impossible clarity and audio fidelity which had clearly been staged in a modern recording studio : <PARA> thanks to schafer , generations of americans too young to remember uncle don were left utterly convinced that he was responsible for the seminal blooper of the radio era , due to their exposure to what they thought was a “ genuine recording ” of a broadcast that never took place . <PARA> the “ little bastards ” rumor may not have ruined don carney ’ s career , but it certainly has unfairly sullied his reputation for close to a century now . <PARA> sightings : an episode of the animated tv series “ the simpsons ” (“ krusty gets kancelled ,” original air date may 13 , 1993 ), makes use of this legend . believing the camera has been turned off , gabbo , the dummy for ventriloquist arthur crandall , says , “ that ought to hold the little s . o . b . s .”

true	back in 1990 , businessman donald trump — although already “ famous ” by some measure — possessed a much lower public profile than he does today . in ensuing years , events such as the publication of multiple books by and about him , the success of the television show “ the apprentice ,” and his entry into u . s . politics would multiply his level of national ( and international ) fame many times over . <PARA> but perhaps the single thing donald trump was most famous for at the beginning of the 1990s was his messy divorce from his first wife ivana , which played out across the headlines of new york tabloids . amid ivana ’ s claims of “ cruel and inhuman treatment ” at the hands of donald , and ivana ’ s accusations that donald had raped her and pulled out her hair by the handful , the couple eventually reached a divorce settlement that reportedly left trump ’ s ex - wife with anywhere from $ 14 million to $ 25 million . <PARA> against the backdrop of this very public divorce , the august 1990 issue of playgirl magazine ( a publication intended to emulate the success of playboy magazine but with a female audience ) teased its readers with a cover blurb that stated “ sleep with donald trump ”: <PARA> the magazine ’ s table of contents offered a blurb for the “ sleep with donald trump ” contest that proclaimed : “ he ’ s rich , almost single and yours for the asking . here ’ s how can you get [ sic ] the donald out of your dreams and into your bed !”: <PARA> the underlying “ contest ” — which was quite likely a pr effort coordinated and paid for by trump himself and / or a book publisher — turned out to be little more than deceptive wordplay , full of flattering remarks about the donald ( even if they were invented ones ) and catty references to his divorce . readers quickly learned that the only “ prize ” to be won in this contest was a pillowcase with trump ’ s face silk - screened onto it : <PARA> unfortunately , history has not left us a record of the reactions of the contest ’ s winners ( if indeed there actually were any ).	
true	in january 2020 , following the tragic death of nba basketball legend kobe bryant , his daughter , gianna , and seven others in a helicopter crash , we received several inquiries from readers about the accuracy of various reports claiming that one anonymous twitter user appeared to have predicted bryant ’ s demise with eerie prescience in a nearly 8 - year - old tweet . <PARA> for example , on jan . 27 , business insider published an article with the headline “ a twitter user who predicted that kobe bryant would die in a helicopter crash apologises .” the article reported that : <PARA> “ the legendary basketball player kobe bryant died on sunday in a helicopter crash alongside his 13 - year old daughter , gianna maria - onore bryant . according to media reports , none survived the crash — including seven others who were aboard the helicopter . in a spine chilling prediction , a twitter user — dotnoso — reportedly predicted that kobe would ‘ end up dying in a helicopter crash .'” <PARA> similar articles were published by gulf news , the times of india , news18 , and ndtv . <PARA> twitter user <USER> tweet came to prominence after bryant ’ s death . it read : “ kobe is going to end up dying in a helicopter crash .” according to its timestamp , it was published at 4 : 32 p . m . eastern standard time on nov . 13 , 2012 ⁠— nearly eight years before the basketball star ’ s death : <PARA> some social media users had speculated that <USER> might have somehow published the tweet after bryant ’ s death in january 2020 but artificially edited the timestamp so that it appeared to have first been tweeted in 2012 , perhaps using a third - party twitter client or application . this was not the case . in response to our inquiries , a spokesperson for twitter told snopes it is simply not possible for anyone to edit the text or timestamp of a tweet once it has been published . <PARA> therefore , <USER> eerily prescient tweet was authentic and was indeed first published in november 2012 . it ’ s not clear what inspired or prompted the post , nor the level of earnestness associated with it . <PARA> on jan . 26 , 2020 , the day of the helicopter crash , <USER> appeared to express remorse in a new tweet posted as a response to the initial tweet . <PARA> even in 2012 , bryant was publicly known to own and regularly use a helicopter for personal travel , and on nov . 12 and 13 , in the hours before <USER> tweet , sports illustrated and usa today both published articles about bryant ’ s helping his lakers teammate steve blake by flying him to the hospital in his personal helicopter . it ’ s possible that the now - infamous tweet was no more than a morbid response to the basketball player ’ s frequent use of that particular mode of transport .	
false	u . s . president donald trump on jan . 16 , 2020 , stated at a gathering in the oval office that “ we ’ re proudly announcing historic steps to protect the first amendment right to pray in public schools .” the move resulted in queries from snopes readers asking whether trump had “ returned ” or “ reinstated ” prayer in public schools . <PARA> joined by education secretary betsy devos , televangelist and adviser paula white , and students who said they faced religious discrimination in school , trump stated his guideline would counter “ a growing totalitarian impulse on the far - left that seeks to punish , restrict , and even prohibit religious expression .” <PARA> seen as a nod to his voting base of evangelicals , trump ’ s rhetoric reflects the idea popular among conservative christians that the 1962 u . s . supreme court ruling in engel v . vitale , which barred schools and employees acting in their official capacity from prescribing or requiring prayer , equated to banning prayer altogether in public schools . <PARA> but that is not the case . students and student groups are free to pray at school , as well as participate in any number of religious activities , so long as those activities don ’ t disrupt school functions or impede the liberties of others . <PARA> trump ’ s guideline , in fact , largely restated one created by president george w . bush in 2003 . because students were never barred from praying on their own in school , however , neither president “ returned ” prayer to public school . <PARA> trump ’ s guidance , per the associated press , buttresses the 2003 guidance by ordering that states “ verify that school districts have no policies limiting constitutionally protected prayer , and to refer violators to the education department . that ’ s much like the 2003 guidance , but the new directive goes further by requiring states to provide ways for filing complaints against schools .” <PARA> in a statement , daniel mach , director of the american civil liberties union ’ s program on freedom of religion and belief , said , “ despite the president ’ s hype , there ’ s very little that ’ s new in today ’ s ‘ school prayer ’ guidance . importantly , both the bush guidance and the copycat document released today [ jan . 16 , 2020 ] affirm a core constitutional protection : school officials are prohibited from imposing their faith on students . the question , as always , is whether public - school officials will heed this warning . if they don ’ t , we ’ ll be there , as always , to correct them — and if necessary , we ’ ll see them in court .” <PARA> because you can ’ t bring something back that never left , we rate the claim that trump “ returned ” prayer to public schools as “ false .” trump did not significantly update guidance from the one issued in 2003 and instead largely reiterated the preexisting rule ; also , prayer was never banned in public schools . <PARA> trump also announced a new rule that would make it easier for religious organizations that provide social services to receive federal contracts . as the washington post reported :	
true	three years after white supremacist violence left one counter - protester dead and scores injured in charlottesville , virginia , that state ’ s gov . ralph northam declared a temporary state of emergency ahead of a pro - gun rally at the state capitol in richmond on mlk day in 2020 . <PARA> some snopes . com readers asked whether the emergency order was real . it was . <PARA> according to news reports , protests at that capitol are an annual event known as lobby day , in which “ citizen activists , including those on both sides of the gun debate , converge on the capitol to press issues directly to lawmakers .” this year was different , however , because for the first time in a generation , voters handed the virginia legislature to a democratic majority . lawmakers have stated they will take the opportunity to pass gun regulations , sparking a conservative backlash . <PARA> the organizer of the jan . 20 rally is a self - described extremist , but had stated his intent to keep the event peaceful . nevertheless , northam expressed concern over fears that armed militia members planned to “ storm the capitol .” <PARA> tactical gear - clad , gun - toting demonstrators gathered outside security perimeters , but no violence was reported at the rally . officials estimated about 22 , 000 attended . <PARA> ahead of the event , the fbi had arrested six men allegedly connected to a white supremacist organization known as “ the base ” in delaware , maryland , and georgia . three of those men allegedly had discussed opening fire during the richmond gun rally for the purpose of creating chaos . <PARA> the executive order banned firearms on capitol grounds and activated emergency services , noting , “ the events that occurred in charlottesville , virginia demonstrated what can happen when peaceful demonstrations are hijacked by those who come into the commonwealth and do not value the importance of peaceful assembly . we lost three virginians . we must take all precautions to prevent that from ever happening again .” <PARA> the executive order also noted that some of the intelligence gathered by law enforcement echoed sentiments in the days leading up to charlottesville : “ available information suggests that a substantial number of these demonstrators are expected to come from outside the commonwealth , may be armed , and have as their purpose not peaceful assembly but violence , rioting , and insurrection .” <PARA> in august 2017 , white supremacist demonstrators gathered in charlottesville for a “ unite the right ” rally . three people died during the event , including counter - protester heather heyer , who was struck by a car driven by a white supremacist who rammed it into a crowd . two virginia state troopers were killed when the helicopter they were flying to monitor the crowds crashed .	
mixture	in mid - december 2019 , u . s . president donald trump claimed on twitter that house speaker nancy pelosi has been “ working on ” impeaching him for 2 1 / 2 years . <PARA> trump posted another tweet , again claiming that pelosi had been trying to impeach him for 2 1 / 2 years , one day later . <PARA> trump was referring to comments made by pelosi at politico ’ s “ women rule ” summit on dec . 10 , 2019 . pelosi was asked about the “ speed ” with which the u . s . house , led by democrats , were undertaking impeachment . <PARA> pelosi headed an impeachment inquiry in the u . s . house of representatives against trump , on accusations that trump used the office of the president to attempt to extort ukraine into producing damaging information on a potential political rival . trump has regularly lashed out at the inquiry as unfair and has sometimes complained that democratic lawmakers have had it in for him since before the inquiry officially started . <PARA> ultimately , the house democratic majority voted to impeach trump , which means that the proceedings will move to a senate trial . <PARA> in answering a question at the summit from politico journalist anna palmer , speaker pelosi appeared to include the start of the investigation into russian interference in the 2016 presidential election , led by special counsel robert mueller , in the impeachment timeline . <PARA> here is the text of the exchange : <PARA> official impeachment proceedings against trump began in the house on nov . 13 , 2019 . although pelosi didn ’ t state this explicitly , democrats in the house had initially considered including evidence from the mueller probe in the articles of impeachment , but ultimately decided against doing so . mueller was appointed on may 17 , 2017 , to lead the russia probe , meaning that from may 2017 to when pelosi made the comments in december 2019 , just over 2 1 / 2 years had lapsed . <PARA> however , pelosi did not initiate the mueller investigation — the u . s . department of justice did . mueller was selected to lead the probe by then - deputy attorney general rod rosenstein , whom trump nominated for that position . although trump and his supporters have typically cast the impeachment proceedings as a democratic conspiracy , multiple probes have been undertaken into foreign interference in elections related to trump , including probes by both the house and republican - led senate . <PARA> therefore , although pelosi apparently lumped the mueller probe into her answer about the impeachment - inquiry timeline , she didn ’ t thereby “ admit ” she was behind the launch of the mueller probe , and in fact she was not . the probe was conducted by the justice department , which at that time was led by jeff sessions and rosenstein , both of whom trump selected to lead the agency . <PARA> investigations have found that the russian government actively sought to influence the 2016 election in an effort to help trump defeat his rival hillary clinton , although none has found conclusively evidence that trump himself worked with the russians in so doing . however , the current impeachment inquiry deals with trump personally making a phone call to ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky and soliciting a corruption probe into the family of 2020 democratic presidential candidate joe biden in exchange for crucial u . s . military aid to ukraine . trump claims his request was solely for the purpose of rooting out corruption in ukraine and not for personal political gain .	
false	on jan . 15 , 2020 , u . s . house speaker nancy pelosi signed the articles of impeachment against president donald trump . the signing ceremony was historic — it was only the third time in u . s . history that a president has been impeached . and , according to critics , the event was bit unusual because pelosi used multiple pens to sign the documents and then handed the writing utensils out as souvenirs . <PARA> a rumor soon started to circulate on social media positing that the pens pelosi had used had cost an obscene amount of money . one twitter user , for instance , claimed that each pen pelosi used cost $ 2 , 025 . a message on facebook held that pelosi had used a total of $ 15 , 000 worth of pens to sign these documents . this number was exaggerated even further by another facebook user who claimed that each pen cost $ 15 , 000 , and that the signing ceremony used a total of $ 450 , 000 pens : <PARA> the most prominent claim , and one that was re - shared verbatim by several different accounts , stated : “ pelosi uses $ 15 , 000 . 00 worth of bullet pens to impeach the president . president trump uses $ 1 . 99 sharpie to sign $ 2 billion trade deal with china . that ’ s the difference in a business man and a worthless professional .” <PARA> while this claim was widespread , it was not supported by evidence . we have encountered no news reports , budget statements , or any other credible information to support the claim that pelosi used $ 15 , 000 worth of pens ( or $ 450 , 000 worth of pens or $ 2 , 025 per pen ) to sign the articles of impeachment against trump . furthermore , these claims appear to have originated with random social media users who would not have been privy to this sort of information . as these users appear to have been making this information up out of whole cloth , it isn ’ t surprising that the alleged cost of these pens varies from one claim to the next . <PARA> drew hammill , pelosi ’ s deputy chief of staff , told us that the pens pelosi used to sign the articles of impeachment cost just under $ 15 apiece , and that they were the same type of pen used to sign other pieces of legislation . at $ 15 a piece , that means the total cost for these pens was about $ 450 , well under the $ 15 , 000 ( or $ 450 , 000 ) amount claimed in those baseless social media posts . <PARA> does trump use a $ 2 sharpie to sign legislation ? <PARA> in 2017 , the trump administration placed an order with long - time pen supplier a . t . cross for 150 “ century ii ” pens to be used for signing executive orders . a . t . cross has been supplying pens to the white house since at least the 1970s . while the cost of these pens vary by model , the century ii pens that trump used at the start of his administration ( this model was also used during president barack obama ’ s administration ) cost a little over $ 100 a piece at retail . <PARA> however , trump has since switched from the century ii pen to a sharpie pen . while sharpie pens can certainly be purchased in the $ 2 range , trump doesn ’ t use a sharpie that you can purchase at a school - supply store . the commander - in - chief reportedly uses a custom sharpie with his signature inscribed down the side . you can see an image of the pen trump uses to sign executive orders here . <PARA> we reached out to the white house and newell brands , the company that manufacturers sharpies , for more information on trump ’ s pen . while we can ’ t say exactly how much trump spends per pen , it seems reasonable to assume that this custom pen is worth more than a $ 2 generic sharpie , but well under the $ 100 pens used at the start of his administration . the “ official donald j . trump fine point markers ” available via the trump campaign shop are sold for $ 15 for a five - pack ( which works out to $ 3 piece ). <PARA> is it unusual to use multiple pens to sign important legislation ? <PARA> in addition to claiming that pelosi used obscenely expensive pens to sign the articles of impeachment against trump , many social media users were upset that the house speaker used multiple writing utensils and then handed them out as souvenirs to mark the occasion . however , this isn ’ t an unusual practice . <PARA> in fact , on the same day pelosi handed out the impeachment pens to various lawmakers , trump performed a similar ritual in the oval office after signing a trade deal with china . <PARA> the photograph above is available via getty images with the following caption : “ washington , dc – january 15 : u . s . president donald trump , accompanied by u . s . trade representative robert lighthizer ( 2nd l ) and treasury secretary steve mnuchin ( r ), hands out pens to senators after he and chinese vice premier liu he , signed phase 1 of a trade deal between u . s . and china , in the east room at the white house , on january 15 , 2020 in washington , dc . phase 1 is expected to cut tariffs and promote chinese purchases of u . s . farm , and manufactured goods while addressing disputes over intellectual property . ( photo by mark wilson / getty images )” <PARA> time magazine explained that this tradition — using multiple pens to sign a document and then to give those pens to various people involved — dates back to at least the 1930s when franklin d . roosevelt was in office : <PARA> the u . s . senate also provided souvenir pens in 1999 during the impeachment trial of bill clinton . according to a contemporary report in the akron beacon , senators used silver parker vector pens ( worth about $ 10 a piece ) to sign the oath book after they were sworn in and were allowed to keep the pens as a memento : <PARA> unfortunately , the pens used during clinton ’ s trial contained a typo ( the term “ united states senator ” on the pen was misspelled “ untied states senator ”) and had to be replaced . <PARA> did pelosi use $ 15 , 000 worth of pens to sign the articles of impeachment ? <PARA> in summary , no evidence exists to support the claim that pelosi used $ 15 , 000 worth of pens to sign the articles of impeachment . this claim originated with random social media accounts and was not supported with documentation . furthermore , pelosi ’ s chief of staff refuted the claim , saying the pens cost just under $ 15 a piece . <PARA> while some may find it objectionable to hand out souvenir pens after signing such a grave document , it isn ’ t unusual . the tradition of using multiple pens to sign important documents , and then giving those pens away to the people involved , can be traced back decades .

false	in december 2019 , social media users shared a meme containing a picture that purported to demonstrate a $ 20 bill could be folded to spell the last name of u . s . president donald trump in a “ hidden ” message . <PARA> the photograph is misleading for several reasons . for starters , the $ 20 bill doesn ’ t have lettering in the area where the bill is folded to spell out “ trump .” <PARA> instead , it appears that one or more $ 1 bills were folded inside the $ 20 to give the illusion : <PARA> because the letter “ p ” does not appear in the phrase “ the united states of america ” on the $ 1 bill , someone apparently used a marker to turn a “ d ” into a “ p ” in order to finish spelling “ trump ” in the meme . <PARA> and finally , anything with lettering on it that can be folded can be used to create whatever “ hidden messages ” the letters allow . <PARA> we therefore rate this claim “ false ” because the picture in the meme is misleadingly manipulated to make it appear “ trump ” can be spelled by folding a single $ 20 bill , thus it is not a “ hidden message ” embedded in currency that was in circulation well before trump ’ s presidency .

false	on march 19 , 1995 , an episode of “ the simpsons ” entitled “ lisa ’ s wedding ” took a futuristic view of springfield ’ s favorite family after homer ’ s daughter visited a fortuneteller ’ s booth . at one point in the episode , lisa ’ s future husband , hugh parkfield , voiced by actor mandy patinkin , bent over and spoke into a strange - looking device on his wrist : a half flip phone , half wristwatch that most modern viewers would liken to a smartwatch . <PARA> this animated gadget can be glimpsed at the 2 : 58 mark of this video about similar simpsons “ predictions .” ( you can read our coverage on “ simpsons ” predictions here .) <PARA> this is a genuine clip from a 1995 episode of “ the simpsons .” it is also true that this episode aired more than 20 years before the “ year of the smartwatch ” in 2014 , when these devices became relatively common . however , “ the simpsons ” shouldn ’ t get credit for “ predicting ” the smartwatch for two reasons : <PARA> it ’ s difficult to pinpoint exactly when the first smartwatch was produced , because it depends on the criteria you use to classify one . the first digital watches were produced in the 1970s . in 1983 , the seiko data - 2000 featured a built - in keyboard for data input . a few years later , sinclair made a watch with an fm radio , and in 1994 seiko unveiled a watch that doubled as a pager . the timex datalink , which was also introduced in 1994 , is a good contender for the first “ modern ” smartwatch because it had the ability to transfer data by linking to a computer . <PARA> the point is that the road to the modern smartwatch has been a long and winding one that predated this episode of “ the simpsons .” <PARA> in addition to these early entries into the smartwatch market , the idea of a smartwatch can be traced back even further . special agent james bond , for instance , has a long history of using watch gadgets to aid his spy craft . in 1973 ’ s “ live and let die ,” bond ’ s watch was equipped with a circular saw and a magnet . in 1977 ’ s “ the spy who loved me ,” bond used his watch to print out tiny messages . in 1995 ’ s “ golden eye ,” bond ’ s watch was equipped with a laser . <PARA> and bond wasn ’ t the only fictional character to use a dual - purpose watch . fred flintstone once communicated via a radio watch , as did members of “ the jetsons .” detective dick tracy also used a radio watch in a 1946 comic strip , and who could forget penny ’ s watch in “ inspector gadget ?” <PARA> in sum , “ the simpsons ” didn ’ t predict the smartwatch . while this episode of “ the simpsons ” is real and truly predated the “ year of the smartwatch ” in 2014 , this was not the first time a smartwatch appeared in a movie , comic strip , or television show . furthermore , the evolution of the smartwatch was well underway by the time this episode aired in 1994 . <PARA> you can read more about “ the simpsons ” alleged predictions in the snopes ’ collection “ the simpsons didn ’ t predict that .”	
mixture	several times in recent years , various websites and online “ listicles ” have claimed that , among other uncanny predictions , the simpsons once pre - empted the real - life censorship of michelangelo ’ s “ david ” statue . <PARA> in particular , in 2017 the comedian and former nfl punter pat mcafee devoted a five - minute segment on his podcast to reviewing and promoting various claimed instances where the classic animated sitcom was remarkably prescient about events that were yet to happen . <PARA> he said : “ the censorship of michelangelo ’ s david : 1990 [ it occurred on the show ], 2016 it happened .” <PARA> likewise , in a 2018 article listing more than 30 occasions when “ real life has imitated ‘ the simpsons ,'” the daily telegraph wrote : <PARA> in may 2019 , business insider published a list of “ 18 times ‘ the simpsons ’ accurately predicted the future ,” including the bowdlerization of “ david ”: <PARA> “ an episode from 1990 titled ‘ itchy and scratchy and marge ’ showed springfieldians protesting against michelangelo ’ s statue of david being exhibited in the local museum , calling the artwork obscene for its nudity . the satire of censorship came true in july 2016 , when russian campaigners voted on whether to clothe a copy of the renaissance statue that had been set up in central st . petersburg .” <PARA> the basic facts , dates , and descriptions of events laid out in these articles and in mcafee ’ s podcast were accurate . the episode in question was season 2 , episode 9 , “ itchy and scratchy and marge ,” and it did indeed first air on dec . 20 , 1990 . <PARA> in the episode , marge rails against the ultra - violence and obscenity of the “ itchy and scratchy show ,” and leads a campaign of censorship against the cartoon . the writers brilliantly examine and expose the relativity and subjectivity of taste , obscenity , and moral standards in culture , and marge ’ s crusade spirals out of control , culminating in a local group picketing michelangelo ’ s “ david ” for its nudity . <PARA> it ’ s also true that , as mcafee alluded to , a campaign took place in the russian city of st . petersburg in 2016 that aimed to remove a replica of the statue , or cover up the male figure ’ s genitals — not a far cry from the kind of campaign depicted in the 1990 “ simpsons ” episode . <PARA> however , the difficulty in claiming that matt groening and his writers “ predicted ” the censorship of michelangelo ’ s “ david ” lies in the fact that campaigns to cover up nude works of art in general , and “ david ” in particular , have existed for centuries . the prevalence of fig leafs on classical statues is testament to that , as alexxa gotthardt wrote for the website artsy in 2018 : <PARA> a more recent example , described by the website of the victoria and albert museum in london , came in the mid - 1800s , when the grand duke of tuscany presented queen victoria with a 6 - meter - high cast of the original statue : <PARA> “ the story goes that on her first encounter with the cast of ‘ david ’ at the museum , queen victoria was so shocked by the nudity that a proportionally accurate fig leaf was commissioned . it was then kept in readiness for any royal visits , when it was hung on the figure using two strategically placed hooks .” <PARA> rather than “ predicting ” the censorship of michelangelo ’ s “ david ,” the writers of “ the simpsons ” were merely describing and satirizing moral crusades of that kind , which had already been happening for hundreds of years , and happened to continue to take place in the nearly 30 years since the episode first aired .	
false	in late 2019 , readers asked us about blog posts that were widely shared on social media and falsely claimed that the reality television star duane chapman , known as “ dog the bounty hunter ,” had died either by suicide or from a pulmonary embolism . <PARA> those reports were false . beginning on nov . 20 , admirers of chapman and his late wife , beth , who died in june after herself being the subject of death hoaxes , began posting tributes to him and sharing one of two blog posts . <PARA> the first purported to be hosted by a website with the domain name whatnow . actual - events . com , but when internet users clicked on the story on social media , they were redirected to the domain newspanel . suzeraincollections . com . there , the story carried the headline “ duane ‘ dog ’ chapman died of pulmonary embolism . he didn ’ t survive his second attack . he was 66 — wgn .” <PARA> the highly dubious website falsely attributed the claim about chapman ’ s death to wgn america , a real u . s . television network that broadcast the chapmans ’ most recent reality show “ dog ’ s most wanted .” the hoax article also misleadingly used wgn america ’ s logo in a sharebait video that purported to be a television news report about chapman ’ s death , but that paused after a few seconds and required users to share the article on social media in order to continue watching : <PARA> in reality , wgn america had no connection to the story and did not report on chapman ’ s death in november 2019 , because chapman did not die in november 2019 . <PARA> the specific claim that chapman had died from a pulmonary embolism ( a blocked artery in the lungs ) was rather insidious . at first glance , it appeared especially plausible to many fans of the television star because he was in fact diagnosed with that very problem in september 2019 . <PARA> the second blog post shared by social media users was even more distasteful than the first . it falsely and misleadingly used the logo of bbc news , a highly reputable and widely trusted information source , to report that chapman had taken his own life . <PARA> in this instance , social media users shared an article that appeared to be hosted on the domain bbc - newsroom . actualeventstv . com , but which redirected to news - room . easystepsdiy . info . on social media , the post carried the headline “ duane ‘ dog ’ chapman died of suicide after depression attack on his sickness — bbc news ” but when users redirected to the source , the article ’ s headline proclaimed : <PARA> “ breaking : ( actual suicide video ) duane ‘ dog ’ chapman died of suicide after depression attack on his sickness — bbc news .” <PARA> despite the extremely distasteful claim that the video in the article contained footage of chapman ’ s suicide , it contained nothing of the sort and , just as in the first article , the video stopped after a second or two and required viewers to share the post on social media in order to continue watching . <PARA> the claim that chapman had taken his own life was , like the claim he had died of a pulmonary embolism , particularly insidious . in the season finale of “ dog ’ s most wanted ,” broadcast by wgn america on nov . 6 , chapman spoke about the recent death of his wife from cancer , and the considerable difficulty he was experiencing in coping with her loss . <PARA> at one moment in the episode , he reportedly discussed how he had contemplated taking his own life , such was his grief . people magazine quoted chapman as saying : <PARA> because of that widely reported revelation , a report that chapman had died by suicide would have appeared somewhat plausible to many readers . <PARA> the dubious nature of the websites involved , and the absence of any corroborating evidence or reports by actual news organizations , meant that some readers would have immediately recognized the stories as hoaxes . however , a significant number were taken in by them , and shared them on social media , to the extent that chapman himself intervened . <PARA> he provided the gossip website tmz a photograph of himself holding the nov . 19 edition of the denver post , and a handwritten sign that read “ i ’ m alive !” chapman then posted a screenshot of that article to his own instagram page the next day . <PARA> if you need help , call the national suicide prevention lifeline : 1 - 800 - 273 - 8255 . or contact crisis text line by texting home to 741741 .	
true	in late 2019 , we received multiple inquiries from readers about reports that rick wiles , a controversial right - wing pastor , had launched a virulently anti - semitic attack on leading congressional democrats , claiming that impeachment proceedings against u . s . president donald trump amounted to a “ jew coup .” <PARA> such reports were published by the times of israel , and the websites boingboing . net and rightwingwatch . org , among others . <PARA> those articles were accurate . on nov . 22 , wiles dedicated an entire 97 - minute episode on his online channel trunews to what the episode billed as “ jew coup : seditious jews orchestrating trump impeachment lynching .” <PARA> wiles has repeatedly indulged and promoted anti - semitic conspiracy theories and tropes on his channel , as documented by the anti - defamation league . the president ’ s son , donald trump jr ., drew criticism in march for agreeing to be interviewed by trunews , despite its record of promoting conspiracy theories and inflammatory misinformation , and the channel has been given access to white house press conferences , and been allowed to put questions to president trump . <PARA> in his nov . 22 episode , wiles continued that pattern of anti - semitic attacks on perceived opponents of trump , hitting on virtually every age - old myth and trope about jewish people and targeting named , individual members of congress , deploying false , outrageous , and at times downright bizarre slurs against them . <PARA> the episode was removed by youtube for violating its rules on hate speech , but as of nov . 27 , the video remained on the trunews website and facebook page , and was still available through itunes as an audio - only podcast . this fact check contains , by necessity , virulently anti - semitic language that some readers might find offensive . <PARA> towards the beginning of the episode , wiles set out his thesis statement : <PARA> “ the ‘ impeach trump ’ movement is a jew coup , plain and simple . the men and women who are the driving forces to remove donald j . trump from the white house are jews . america is in the throes of a political coup led by jews . president trump is surrounded by a rabid pack of seditious , treacherous jews who are intent on overthrowing the votes of millions of christians who elected him in 2016 .” <PARA> at several points , wiles used language that suggested civil war was inevitable in the united states , as a result of the fictional “ jew coup ,” and in one instance appeared to encourage a violent “ backlash ” against a non - existent jewish plan to “ kill millions of christians .” <PARA> in one instance , his co - host doc burkhart parsed a campaign ad by u . s . rep . elaine luria , d - va ., suggesting that a reference in the ad to “ all enemies , foreign and domestic ” ( from the congressional oath of office ) meant she was accusing trump of being such a domestic enemy . wiles shot back “ i consider these jews to be domestic enemies ! these are seditious , treacherous jews who are undermining the president of the united states and pushing this country to civil war .” <PARA> he later mused : “ this country could be in civil war at christmas time . members of the u . s . military are going to have to take a stand , just like they did in the 1860s with the civil war ... people are going to be forced , possibly by this christmas , to take a stand , because of this jew coup in the united states . we have weeks to stop it .” <PARA> towards the end of the broadcast , wiles urged his viewers : “ there is going to be a backlash . if there isn ’ t a backlash , the country is over , you have been taken over by a jewish cabal , a bolshevik revolution ... get it through your head ! they ’ re coming for you ! there will be a purge , that ’ s the next thing that happens when jews take over a country — they kill millions of christians !” <PARA> wiles labeled rep . adam schiff , d - calif ., a “ lying , jewish congressman ,” adding : “ that ’ s the way the jews work . they are deceivers , they plot , they lie , they do whatever they have to do to accomplish their political agenda .” <PARA> wiles parroted trump ’ s epithet of choice for the influential chair of the house intelligence committee , calling him “ shifty schiff ” and launching a bizarre , personal attack on him : <PARA> “ his eyes — he freaks me out , doc , there ’ s something wrong with that man . seriously , mentally there ’ s something mentally wrong with that man ... he looks demon - possessed . honestly , adam schiff looks like a mental psycho . he creeps me out .” <PARA> wiles then deployed yet another age - old calumny against jewish people , implying that schiff ’ s true loyalties did not lie with the united states : “ and he ’ s chairman of the house intelligence committee ? oh boy , i wonder how much intelligence is flowing to israel .” <PARA> the florida - based pastor labeled gordon sondland , u . s . ambassador to the european union and a key witness in impeachment hearings , a “ treacherous , lying , deceiving jewish operative .” on more than one occasion , wiles likened jews to animals and carriers of disease — a notorious , anti - semitic rhetorical device that was used most damagingly during the rise to power of the nazis in 1930s germany . <PARA> he said the list of participants and witnesses involved in the ukrainian controversy , which has been a key focus of impeachment hearings so far , was “ infested with jews ” ( congress is investigating whether trump asked ukraine to investigate his political rival joe biden and family in exchange for military aid ). wiles also claimed that a group of “ treacherous , seditious jews ” were “ surrounding the president like a pack of wolves .” he described lt . col . alexander vindman , another key witness in the impeachment hearings and a purple heart recipient , as a “ treacherous snake .” <PARA> the depths of anti - semitism to which the program sank was perhaps best summed up in a moment when burkhart referred to the “ protocols of the elders of zion ,” an early 20th century fabricated document that purported to be a record of a jewish conspiracy for global domination , but was later definitively shown to be a hoax . <PARA> “ protocols ” is a quintessential example of deliberately inflammatory , anti - semitic disinformation , and was widely deployed by the nazis as propaganda in order to vindicate the annihilation of the jewish people . burkhart mused : “ some say it ’ s fake , i believe there ’ s a lot of truth to it .” wiles added : “ whoever wrote it back in the 1800s , they accurately predicted what was going to happen in the world .”	
true	for years , questions about sea otters ’ alleged propensity toward cross - species sexual violence have passed through snopes ’ inbox . on nov . 25 , 2019 , comedian michele wolfe teased a segment from an upcoming comedy special that presented the assertion that “ otters rape baby seals ” as part of a bit , leading us to finally dive into the claim : <PARA> the claim is supported by firsthand accounts and multiple scientific studies . a 2010 paper , for example , published in the scientific journal aquatic mammals , documented “ nineteen occurrences of interspecific sexual behavior between male southern sea otters and juvenile pacific harbor seals ... in monterey bay , california , between 2000 and 2002 .” that paper documented , for the first time , that otters occasionally inflict enough injury during this “ forced copulation ” that the juvenile seal is killed , as described in this graphic account : <PARA> otters do not direct such violence on juvenile seals only . the above account is similar to an incident described in a 2015 story in the vancouver sun , except the victim in that case was a pet dog : <PARA> what possible explanation exists for this disturbing behavior ? one theory , proffered by the authors of the study on the monterey bay otters , is that it could be a side effect of the extremely hierarchical behavior of the animal . male otters must compete with other males to gain control of territory and sexually receptive females . as a result , “ males typically establish a dominance hierarchy based on age , size , and relative fitness such that subdominant males will have limited access to receptive females of the same species .” the study authors suggest that an increase in males relative to females could lead subdominant male otters to attempt to mate with individuals of other species , generally female adults or juveniles of either sex , that share the same area . <PARA> at least for monterey bay and the large number of cases of forced otter - seal copulation documented there in the early 2000s , this scenario has some theoretical support . the sex ratio of that population of otters shifted toward being especially male dominated due to a disproportionate number of female deaths in the 5 to 10 years preceding the study period . further , male otters unable to control territory sometimes form “ male groups ” in habitats physically similar to monterey bay . <PARA> of course this does not explain the specific and violent behavior evidenced in the examples above , nor does it explain the behavior otters partake in with their victims after their death . it bears mentioning , though , that even regular otter - to - otter sex is no picnic , involving sneak attacks and coercive and violent force : <PARA> while we note that “ juvenile seals ” ( as described in the monterey bay study ) are not necessarily “ baby seals ” ( as in unweaned from their mother ), we rank the claim that otters rape “ baby ” seals ( as in young ) as “ true ” because the phenomenon is well - documented scientifically .

false	in february 2019 , we investigated a rumor that u . s . rep . adam schiff had used taxpayer money to settle a sexual harassment claim in 2013 . that rumor ( which was entirely false ) was based on a junk news article that cited a non - existent report from the los angeles times . <PARA> a few months later , just as schiff , who heads the house intelligence committee , started to hold public hearings in the impeachment inquiry into president donald trump , social media users added a devious twist to this false claim . an old photograph of schiff with a child started to circulate on facebook along with the claim that “ adam schiff was a known pedophile ” who had settled numerous sex crimes cases out of court : <PARA> there is no truth to this claim . <PARA> those spreading this rumor have offered nothing in terms of evidence to support this claim . when we “ looked it up !,” as the meme insists , the only thing we found to tangentially support this rumor was a months - old junk news article that we had already debunked . <PARA> the photograph in the above - displayed meme is real . however , its quality has been severely degraded to make it look old and suspicious , like something that needed to be hidden , in an apparent attempt to prop up the false rumors . but this photograph was not uncovered in some sort of investigation into these non - existent crimes . this photograph was shared by schiff himself in february 2017 about his “ little brother david ” and his time volunteering with the big brothers big sisters program : <PARA> the boy in this photograph is david mcmillan , who , as of this writing , is approximately 40 years old . mcmillan has never accused schiff of any inappropriate behavior . in fact , after schiff posted this image , mcmillan responded , writing : “ love this photo ! we were both so young !! 😊😊 and yes , be a mentor ! it changes lives – it certainly changed mine !” <PARA> this was at least the second time that schiff posted a photograph of himself and mcmillan . in 2015 , the congressman posted a recent photograph of himself and mcmillan after attending his “ little brother ’ s ” stage production :	
false	in november 2019 , we received multiple inquiries from readers about widely shared social media posts claiming irony or hypocrisy at work in the production of a massive san francisco mural in honor of the young climate activist greta thunberg . <PARA> on nov . 8 , the right - leaning social media activist brandon straka tweeted a link to a kpix - tv article about the mural , adding his own view that , “ the leftist geniuses in san francisco have decided to send a message about climate change by creating a 6 story [ sic ] mural of greta thunberg using 700 gallons of aerosol spray paint .” <PARA> the text of straka ’ s tweet , and screenshots of it , were further promulgated by multiple users on facebook . the kpix - tv article to which he linked did not contain any reference to the paint used by argentinian artist andrés pereoselli ( known as “ cobre ”) in creating the thunberg mural . as such , it did not provide any evidence to support straka ’ s key claim , that the portrait of the climate activist required 700 gallons of aerosol spray paint . <PARA> it ’ s not clear where that figure came from , but it might have originated in an article on the right - leaning website the blaze , which wrote : <PARA> “ while it is unclear how many spray cans [ cobre ] has used , the mural spans four stories and at least one smaller project utilized 500 cans of the paint scientists say can generate asthma - inducing smog .” <PARA> the daily wire , another right - leaning website , subsequently extrapolated that “ the thunberg mural will likely take closer to 700 cans to finish .” <PARA> in response to concerns about the use of aerosol spray paint , one atmosphere , a california environmental non - profit group that collaborated with cobre on the mural , posted the following explanation to instagram on nov . 11 : <PARA> after the completion of the project , one atmosphere ’ s executive director paul scott provided further details to snopes in an email . he firmly rejected the claim that the project required 700 gallons , or even 700 cans , of spray paint . <PARA> in reality , scott said he counted a total of 117 used 400 - ml cans of spray paint , almost all of them from the mtn 94 brand . that ’ s just over 12 gallons in total . however , only some of that 400 - ml capacity is taken up by the hydrocarbon propellant that escapes into the atmosphere ( as opposed to the liquid paint , which ends up on the side of the building ). <PARA> all aerosol spray paints use a propellant to help disperse the paint from the can and onto its intended surface . in the past , manufacturers used chlorofluorocarbons ( cfcs ), chemicals that were widely banned from the late 1980s onwards due to the fact that they deplete the ozone layers in the arctic and antarctic circles . <PARA> in the united states in 2019 , spray paint manufacturers use hydrocarbons such as propane and butane as propellants . unlike cfcs , hydrocarbons don ’ t have a deleterious effect on ozone , but they do have a small effect on global warming . however , it ’ s worth putting the scale of that effect into some context , using a measure known as global warming potential . <PARA> as the federal environmental protection agency ( epa ) explains on its website : <PARA> “ the global warming potential ( gwp ) was developed to allow comparisons of the global warming impacts of different gases . specifically , it is a measure of how much energy the emissions of 1 ton of a gas will absorb over a given period of time , relative to the emissions of 1 ton of carbon dioxide ( co2 ). the larger the gwp , the more that a given gas warms the earth compared to co2 over that time period .” <PARA> the cfcs used as propellants in aerosol paint in the past have a gwp of between 5 , 000 and 14 , 000 . propane , a hydrocarbon commonly used now as a propellant in spray paint , has a gwp of 4 . in his email to snopes , scott added that , “ the amount of the propellant is also less because the cans are lower pressure , and obviously only a portion of each can is propellant , so the ultimate gwp impact of the cans we used is very limited .” <PARA> scott told snopes that one atmosphere had also sought to neutralize any effects caused by the thunberg mural through the use of carbon offsets . he wrote : “ we purchased carbon offsets that will cover far more than the small footprint left by the limited number of spray cans used on our project .”	
false	on veteran ’ s day 2019 , an inaccurate tweet that accused u . s . president donald trump of once having attempted to evict a disabled veteran from a new york city property called trump village for owning a service dog drew outraged responses : <PARA> a residential property bearing trump ’ s name in new york ’ s coney island did try to evict eugene ovsishcher , an afghanistan veteran , in 2012 because the housing complex had a no - dogs policy . upon the advice of his doctors , ovsishcher had obtained a service dog named mickey , a shih tzu that helped him cope with post - traumatic stress disorder . months later , the co - op board tried to evict ovsishcher for having the dog , even though he possessed documentation from his doctors showing that the dog was a service animal . <PARA> in january 2015 , the u . s . department of housing and urban development ( hud ) intervened , accusing igor olberman , who was at that time the president of the trump village co - op board , with violating the fair housing act for failing to allow disabled residents to keep service animals . the resulting settlement reached between hud and the co - op board noted that the housing complex was “ owned by shareholders , most of whom are residents of the building .” <PARA> the settlement stipulated that although trump village has since changed its policy and begun allowing residents to keep pets , it must allow reasonable accommodations for service animals should it ever revert to its previous policy and again disallow animals . ovsishcher not only got to keep mickey , he was also paid $ 15 , 000 by trump village as reimbursement for legal fees he incurred , according to the agreement . <PARA> thus the situation has not only been resolved , but it had nothing to do with donald trump . in 2015 , the co - op board settled the case , allowing ovsishcher to keep mickey . and while the trump village complex where ovsishcher lived may have been built by donald trump ’ s father in 1964 , the trumps sold the property in 2003 , long before dispute with ovsishcher began . we are therefore labeling this claim “ false .”	
mixture	in november 2019 , the website mycolumbuspower published an article claiming that a “ new std superbug ” had the capacity to kill people within days and that health officials were worried that the incoming epidemic would be worse than aids : <PARA> this article stirred up a considerable amount of concern on social media . however , this article was already several years old . furthermore , the claim that there is an “ std superbug ” that is “ worse than aids ” can be traced back to a single quote from a single doctor and has been disputed by other medical professionals . <PARA> archived pages from the internet wayback machine show that while the date on this mycolumbuspower article currently reads nov . 7 , 2019 , this article has actually been on the site since at least september 2014 . furthermore , the information contained within is based on a cnbc report that was originally published in april 2013 . <PARA> cnbc quoted alan christianson , a doctor of naturopathic medicine , who was concerned about an antibiotic - resistant strain of gonorrhea called “ ho41 ” that had been discovered in a woman in japan . <PARA> the news outlet reported : <PARA> while the above - quoted text did originate with a genuine news source , there are a few problems worth noting about this report . <PARA> for one , as of this writing , six years after the cnbc article was originally published , there has not been an aids - level epidemic due to this gonorrhea strain . while health officials may have been concerned at the time , the claim that this strain was “ worse than aids ” has proved to be overstated . <PARA> the cnbc article was also updated to note that “ there have been no treatment failures reported in the u . s . for gonorrhea treated with currently - recommended first - line regimens .” <PARA> furthermore , although cnbc quoted a doctor of naturopathic medicine saying that this strain of gonorrhea could be “ worse than aids ,” other medical professionals weighed in at the time to dispute this classification . dr . bruce hirsch , an attending physician in infectious diseases at north shore university hospital in manhasset , n . y ., told live science that this was not a fair comparison : <PARA> although this strain of gonorrhea has not proven to be “ worse than aids ” and has not spurred any sort of epidemic , antibiotic - resistant strains of gonorrhea are a real and serious problem . health officials have developed several ways to treat gonorrhea , but this disease has adapted over the years and is now resistant to many of them . <PARA> the cdc told us in an email that gonorrhea has developed resistance to most treatments over the years . as of this writing , however , the disease can still be treated with antibiotics : <PARA> this video from the cdc explains how health officials are racing to find new drugs to treat gonorrhea as this disease becomes more resistant to antibiotics : <PARA> lastly , it should be noted that when this mycolumbuspower article was shared on social media it was accompanied by a misleading image : <PARA> this is not an image of gonorrhea or an std superbug . this image actually shows the back of a man with aids and syphilis .

true	on oct . 27 , 2019 , u . s . president trump announced the death of islamic state ( is ) leader abu bakr al - baghdadi . as news outlets quickly fielded reports about the terrorist leader ’ s death , the washington post published an obituary that labeled al - baghdadi an “ austere religious scholar .” <PARA> screenshots of this obituary headline were widely shared on social media along with criticism of the news outlet . former white house press secretary sean spicer , for instance , posted the following message on twitter : <PARA> this is a genuine headline that briefly appeared on washingtonpost . com . an archived version of the article can be found here . <PARA> the headline appeared on the washington post ’ s website for about two hours . the story was published at 8 : 31 a . m . cdt , according to the article ’ s timestamp . this headline was changed to “ abu bakr al - baghdadi , extremist leader of islamic state , dies at 48 ” at about 10 : 35 a . m ., according to archived links from the internet wayback machine . <PARA> kristine coratti kelly , the vice president and communications general manager of washington post live , posted a message on twitter saying that the headline “ should never have read that way .” <PARA> the qualms over the washington post ’ s headline likely served as the inspiration of a meme targeting another “ mainstream media ” outlet , cnn . some social media users started to share an image that supposedly showed a screenshot from a cnn broadcast about al - baghdadi ’ s death featuring the chyron “ trump kills unarmed father of three ”: <PARA> for the record , while the washington post briefly published a headline for al - baghdadi ’ s obituary labeling him a religious scholar , the above - displayed chryon is a digital manipulation featuring a years - old image of don lemon that never aired on cnn .	
true	in october 2019 , we received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of reports that u . s . president donald trump had said his administration was building a border fence in colorado , a state that does not share a border with any other country . <PARA> several major news outlets reported trump ’ s remarks , including the cnn , washington post , usa today and fox news . <PARA> colorado ’ s democratic governor , jared polis , mocked the president on twitter , writing : “ well this is awkward ... colorado doesn ’ t border mexico . good thing colorado now offers free full day kindergarten so our kids can learn basic geography .” sen . patrick leahy , d - vt ., also made fun of trump ’ s remarks , tweeting out a map of the united states with the southern border crudely redrawn so that it appeared to run between colorado and “ new mexico ”: <PARA> those news reports were accurate . trump did indeed say , “ we ’ re building a wall in colorado ” during a speech in pennsylvania . however , he later offered an incoherent explanation ( but an attempted explanation nonetheless ) for his remarks . <PARA> trump ’ s comments came towards the end of his keynote speech at the shale insight conference in pittsburgh , pennsylvania , on oct . 23 . the official transcript of that speech can be read here , and the relevant portion can be viewed below . trump was listing some of the purported accomplishments of his administration when he said : <PARA> trump clearly listed colorado as one of the states in which his administration was purportedly building a reinforced border fence along the southern border with mexico , an impossibility because colorado does not border mexico . <PARA> the president later attempted to explain his remarks , writing in a tweet : <PARA> that explanation did not appear to make sense . its punctuation and grammar were confusing and made it difficult to extract clear meaning from the tweet , but trump initially seemed to be saying that his remark about a border wall in colorado was meant in jest ( because of the initial parenthetical disclaimer “ kiddingly ”). <PARA> this does not accord with what the video footage shows , which is trump saying , “ we ’ re building a wall in colorado ” without laughing , and the audience ’ s responding by applauding without laughing . it ’ s also simply not clear , on its face , what the joke was supposed to be . <PARA> trump also seemed to offer a second explanation , that the aggregate sense or meaning of his remarks about colorado and kansas referred to people from colorado and kansas “ getting the benefit of the border wall .” <PARA> this does not make sense on its own terms , because while trump did say “ we ’ re not building a wall in kansas , but they get the benefit of the walls that we just mentioned ,” he specifically said something radically different of colorado , namely “ we ’ re building a wall in colorado .” in trump ’ s speech , both states got the benefit of the border wall , but one of them ( colorado ) supposedly derived that benefit specifically by having a portion of the wall located there — which it does not . <PARA> this second explanation also appears to contradict the first . if trump sincerely intended to say what he said about colorado , as part of a confusing larger point about the collective benefit to colorado and kansas of having a border wall , then how can this be reconciled with his apparent disclaimer that he had spoken “ kiddingly ”? <PARA> we put this and several other questions to the white house , requesting an explanation of what trump said in pittsburgh and a clarification of his subsequent tweet . we did not receive a response . <PARA> trump said “ we ’ re building a wall in colorado .” however , he subsequently made some effort to explain or clarify that statement , suggesting he may have been joking ( although it ’ s not at all clear what the element of humor was ), and also making a somewhat garbled point about colorado , like kansas , getting the benefit of a border wall . <PARA> those explanations did not make sense , they contradicted one another , and it ’ s still not clear whether trump intended to name colorado or simply misspoke . nonetheless , the president has , after a fashion , addressed his statement that “ we ’ re building a wall in colorado ” and endeavored , however incoherently , to put some distance between it and himself .

false	in october 2019 , u . s . president donald trump ’ s public appearances with his italian counterpart , sergio mattarella , gave rise to a veritable explosion of viral claims that trump had butchered his guest ’ s name , referring to him as “ president mozzarella .” widely shared memes also claimed that trump had said the united states and italy had been allies since the era of ancient rome . <PARA> notably absent from the many social media posts that expressed a mixture of glee and horror at trump ’ s supposed “ mozzarella ” gaffe was any video footage . the reason for that absence was that the president never actually referred to his italian counterpart as “ mozzarella .” <PARA> trump and mattarella held three public events together on oct . 16 : they spoke to the press before their bilateral meeting at the oval office ; held a press conference ; and spoke at a reception in the evening . video footage is available of all three events . <PARA> we watched those three events in full and found no instance in which trump referred to mattarella as “ president mozzarella .” by contrast , trump uttered the italian president ’ s last name correctly on four occasions : <PARA> furthermore , trump never actually claimed that the united states and italy had been allies since the era of ancient rome , something that would clearly be wrong because the u . s . was only founded as an independent nation in 1776 , and italy was only unified in the 19th century , becoming a republic in the 1940s . <PARA> what trump actually said , in his opening remarks during the press conference , was as follows : <PARA> “ the united states and italy are bound together by a shared cultural and political heritage dating back thousands of years , to ancient rome ...” <PARA> trump said the two countries share a political and cultural heritage , and that that heritage dates back thousands of years . he did not claim that the two countries have shared an alliance for thousands of years — something that would have required both nations to exist as polities during the era of the roman empire , which clearly neither did . <PARA> the phrase “ dating back thousands of years ” evidently caused many commentators to misunderstand the meaning of trump ’ s remarks . but it ’ s the heritage that goes back that far , not the binding of the two nations . <PARA> the influence of the roman republic on the formation and principles of the american republic is well - documented , and trump ’ s point was historically sound .	
false	one of the things former president barack obama was known for while in office was engaging in corny quips termed “ dad jokes ,” many of them self - deprecating . so to some people , it may not have seemed out of the realm of possibility in october 2019 that he would have lobbed a “ dad joke ” on twitter that invoked the past conspiracy theories about his place of birth and a current scandal involving his white house successor and ukraine . <PARA> the tweet , dated october 4 , 2019 , was an apparent forgery , as we found no evidence that the 44th president posted it from his account : <PARA> the fake tweet was a play on an impeachment inquiry spearheaded by democratic members of the house of representatives over allegations that president donald trump had attempted to extort damaging information on a political rival from ukraine by withholding military aid to that country . <PARA> as well , the “ birth certificate ” reference riffed on the “ birther ” conspiracy theory , the discredited notion proffered by some ( including donald trump ) that obama was born in kenya and not the united states , thereby disqualifying him from holding the u . s . presidency .

true	in september and october 2019 , we received multiple inquiries from readers about the veracity of reports that claimed u . s . sen . elizabeth warren had said or argued to the effect that “ taxpayers must fund sex reassignment surgery .” <PARA> on aug . 14 , the right - leaning website onenewsnow published an article with the headline , “ warren : taxpayers must fund sex reassignment surgery ,” which reported that : <PARA> warren ’ s tweet included a link to the website protect trans health , a campaign run by the transgender law center and the national center for transgender equality . the purpose of that campaign was to solicit and convey criticism to the u . s . department of health and human services ( hhs ) about its controversial move to repeal an obama - era rule that prohibits healthcare and insurance providers from discriminating against trans individuals . <PARA> so the source cited by onenewsnow did not involve warren saying , “ taxpayers must fund sex reassignment surgery .” the phrasing of the website ’ s headline may have given some readers the impression it was a direct quote , even though onenewsnow did not actually use quotation marks . it might also have led some to believe warren had proposed that all sex - reassignment surgeries must be taxpayer - funded , which is not the case . <PARA> nonetheless , an examination of the record , and confirmation from warren ’ s 2020 presidential campaign , make it clear that she does indeed support covering sex - reassignment surgery under taxpayer - funded programs like medicaid , as well as full legal access to the surgery , under private health insurance and obamacare . <PARA> we asked the warren campaign whether she supports gender - reassignment surgery , and other transition - related services such as medication , being made available at low cost or no cost , under taxpayer - funded programs such as medicare , medicaid , tricare ( for military service members and veterans ), as well as through obamacare and private health insurance policies . a campaign spokesperson was unequivocal in response : “ yes .” <PARA> the campaign also directed us to a september 2019 interview warren conducted with “ hiv plus ” magazine , in which she gave further details about her stance on the issue . the interview refers to section 1557 of the affordable care act ( obamacare ), so a brief explanation is warranted . <PARA> section 1557 incorporated existing anti - discrimination law into the affordable care act ( aca ). it prohibited healthcare or insurance providers that receive federal funding ( include state - by - state medicaid programs ) from discriminating against patients on the basis of their sex , race , religion , national origin , and so on . <PARA> in 2016 , hhs under president barack obama implemented a new rule that expanded those protections from discrimination and , most notably , defined sex discrimination as including discrimination on the basis of a patient ’ s gender identity , as well as their having previously terminated a pregnancy , among other changes . <PARA> federally funded healthcare and insurance providers ( including state medicaid programs ) could not deny services or treatment access to individuals on the basis of their gender identity , and could not categorically refuse to cover treatments related to gender transition , such as sex - reassignment surgery . <PARA> in may 2019 , hhs under president donald trump proposed another new rule that would largely reverse the section 1557 expansions brought by the obama administration , removing gender identity and pregnancy termination from the definition of sex discrimination . it would also add an explicit religious freedom exemption from the requirements of section 1557 . the department wrote in a press release : <PARA> “ in 2016 , hhs issued a new rule that redefined discrimination ‘ on the basis of sex ’ to include termination of pregnancy and gender identity which it defined as one ’ s internal sense of being ‘ male , female , neither , or a combination of male and female .’ in response to a subsequent lawsuit by several states and healthcare entities , on december 31 , 2016 , a federal court preliminarily enjoined the rule ’ s gender identity and termination of pregnancy provisions on a nationwide basis , finding them contrary to the applicable civil rights law , the religious freedom restoration act , and the administrative procedure act . <PARA> “ a second federal court agreed . because the preliminary injunction continues to be in effect , hhs cannot , and has not since the date of the injunction , enforced the rule ’ s provisions the court said are likely unlawful . the proposed rule would revise the provisions subject to those injunctions to conform with the plain understanding recognized by the court .” <PARA> with that context and background in mind , the following is the most relevant exchange from warren ’ s september 2019 interview with “ hiv plus ” magazine : <PARA> warren ’ s declaration that she would as president “ direct hhs to interpret section 1557 under its 2016 guidance ” means she would enforce , once again , a set of rules that mean sex - reassignment surgery would be covered under federal programs such as medicare , medicaid , and tricare , including state - by - state medicaid programs . <PARA> as such , it is accurate to claim that warren does propose and has proposed that taxpayers should cover the cost of some sex - reassignment surgeries , as they do other treatments and services , under those programs . <PARA> warren was also one of 31 u . s . senators who signed on to a june 2019 letter to trump ’ s hhs , which opposed and criticized the proposed reversal of the 2016 anti - discrimination enhancements . warren was joined in signing that latter by fellow presidential candidates and u . s . senators kamala harris , kirsten gillibrand , bernie sanders , amy klobuchar , and cory booker . <PARA> warren has therefore put on the record , several times in 2019 , her support for sex - reassignment surgery being included among the treatments and services covered under taxpayer - funded programs , as well as under obamacare and private health insurance policies . <PARA> however , the onenewsnetwork headline had a tendency to mislead some readers who may have interpreted its phrasing to mean that warren had said , word - for - word , “ taxpayers must fund sex reassignment surgery ,” or that she had advocated taxpayers must fund any and all sex reassignment surgery , rather than simply adding one more procedure to the list of procedures taxpayers already fund under medicaid and similar federal programs . <PARA> as such , we issue a rating of “ mostly true .”	
false	in september 2019 , whistleblower allegations that u . s . president donald trump held back military aid to ukraine in an effort to obtain damaging information on a political rival led to an impeachment inquiry and an ongoing scandal . <PARA> it wouldn ’ t be the 2010s if the fallout didn ’ t include a conspiracy theory circulating in the right - wing media ecosystem . in this case , the conspiracy theory was given a major platform in the form of a tweet by trump that his supporters widely shared : <PARA> the claim originated on the federalist website , which published a story on sept . 27 that was not only inaccurate but played on the “ deep state ” conspiracy theory , an idea now popular among both fringe fanatics and white house officials alike . it posits that u . s . intelligence agencies are scheming against trump . <PARA> the federalist story implied that the intelligence community changed existing rules so that the “ anti - trump complaint ” could be filed on aug . 12 using secondhand information . “ between may 2018 and august 2019 , the intelligence community secretly eliminated a requirement that whistleblowers provide direct , first - hand knowledge of alleged wrongdoings ,” the federalist reported . <PARA> the federalist story included purported screenshots of previous and current versions of the disclosure of urgent concern form . the current form allows the whistleblower to check a box indicating that the person either learned of the information firsthand or from others , whereas the previous form contained the following language : but as julian sanchez , senior fellow at the libertarian think tank cato institute , pointed out , even the previous version shown above doesn ’ t say there was a “ requirement that whistleblowers provide direct , first - hand knowledge of alleged wrongdoings .” the law has never required them to do so . <PARA> sanchez pointed out that the form pictured above contains a “ description of the inspector general ’ s ( ig ) standard for making a credibility determination , as required by statute , within 14 days of the submission of a complaint . according to that guidance , the ig would not make a finding of credibility , and thus transmit the complaint to the [ director of national intelligence ], unless the dni was in possession of direct evidence supporting the claim .” <PARA> it does not say , sanchez continued , “ that whistleblowers may not submit reports based on secondhand knowledge , but rather that such reports will not be escalated to the dni unless the ig can obtain more .” <PARA> the intelligence community inspector general ’ s office ( icig ) was forced to issue a statement on sept . 30 correcting the record . the statement read , in part : <PARA> in other words , the entire premise of the federalist story is wrong . no requirement exists that whistleblowers provide firsthand knowledge of alleged wrong - doings , and changing the rules would have required an act of congress . <PARA> tom devine , legal director for the watchdog non - profit government accountability project , called the federalist story a “ shameless legal bluff .” <PARA> “ no bureaucrat has the lawful authority to change the rules of the game for whistleblower rights ,” devine told us . “ not even the president can change that unilaterally .” <PARA> so how did the claim come about ? it ’ s true that the wording on an explanatory form for whistleblowers was changed , but the rules were not . the icig ’ s statement notes that the wording was revised because “ certain language in those forms and , more specifically , the informational materials accompanying the forms , could be read — incorrectly — as suggesting that whistleblowers must possess first - hand information in order to file an urgent concern complaint with the congressional intelligence committees .” <PARA> devine added that government whistleblowers who report allegations of wrongdoing based on hearsay are still valuable resources in ferreting out government waste , corruption , and wrongdoing . <PARA> “ if we restricted all credible government investigations to those with whistleblowers who have firsthand information , we ’ d cancel out 90 % of law enforcement activity ,” devine said . “ whistleblower investigations are routinely based on hearsay .” <PARA> the icig ’ s sept . 30 statement additionally noted that the whistleblower ’ s complaint did not contain only secondhand , “ unsubstantiated assertions .” the whistleblower “ checked two relevant boxes : the first box stated that , ‘ i have personal and / or direct knowledge of events or records involved ’; and the second box stated that , ‘ other employees have told me about events or records involved .'” <PARA> in summary , the icig statement said :

false	a popular rumor floating around social media posits that democrats have attempted to impeach every republican president since dwight d . eisenhower : <PARA> this claim is both factually inaccurate and misleading . <PARA> the u . s . has had six republican presidents since eisenhower left office in 1961 : richard nixon , gerald ford , ronald reagan , george h . w . bush , george w . bush , and donald trump . the claim is wrong on its face because democrats made no effort to impeach ford . while a handful of democratic lawmakers have introduced articles of impeachment against five of the last six republican presidents , in most cases these efforts weren ’ t taken seriously by the party at large . nixon and trump have been the only republican presidents since ike who have faced a serious threat of impeachment . <PARA> multiple ways exist to start the impeachment process . typically , it begins when a member of the house of representatives introduces articles of impeachment . from there , the matter is typically referred to a committee where an inquiry can be opened . if the committee finds that the evidence warrants impeachment , they can send the matter to the full house for a vote . if the house votes to impeach , the case gets sent to the senate , where an impeachment hearing is held . if two - thirds of the senators vote to convict , the president is removed from office . <PARA> here ’ s a simplified version of this process : <PARA> the impeachment efforts against reagan , bush jr ., and bush sr . only reached the first step of this process . these efforts didn ’ t receive much support from the democratic party as a whole , and they never made their way out of committee for a vote in front of the full house . when rep . henry b . gonzalez , d - texas , introduced articles of impeachment against reagan in 1987 , the associated press reported that the effort had “ virtually no chance of being approved ”: <PARA> gonzalez also filed articles of impeachment against bush sr ., first in 1991 , when h . r . 34 was referred to house judiciary committee , and then again in 1992 , when h . r . 86 was put before the subcommittee on economic and commercial law . neither of these efforts received a vote . <PARA> the impeachment effort against bush jr . was a bit more serious . congressmen dennis kucinich , d - ohio , and robert wexler , d - fla ., introduced 35 articles of impeachment against bush to the u . s . house of representatives in june 2008 . twenty - four republicans joined 227 democrats to vote in favor of sending the resolution to the house committee on the judiciary . bush would leave office a few months later , however , before any other action was taken on the matter . <PARA> while articles of impeachment were introduced against reagan and bush sr ., these efforts never received the backing of the democratic party , never made it past committee , and were never brought to the house for a vote . a bit more support existed behind the impeachment efforts against bush jr ., but again , this matter was not referred to the house for a full vote . <PARA> the only republican president since eisenhower ( and before donald trump ) who faced a serious threat of impeachment was nixon . nixon made it to step 2 of the impeachment process in july 1974 when the judiciary committee voted to send articles of impeachment to the house for a vote . this was a bipartisan effort , however , as six of the 17 republicans on the judiciary committee joined their 21 democrat colleagues to vote in favor of the resolution . <PARA> nixon would have faced a vote in front of the full house , but he resigned from office before the vote took place . <PARA> as of this writing , trump is in the middle of step 2 of the impeachment process . u . s . house speaker nancy pelosi has announced an official impeachment inquiry into the president , but the matter has not yet been referred to house of representatives for an official impeachment vote . <PARA> to sum up : this meme claims that democrats have tried to impeach every republican president since eisenhower . as no impeachment efforts were made against gerald ford , this claim is false . it is true , however , that articles of impeachment were filed against five of the last six republican presidents . in two of those cases ( reagan and bush sr .), these efforts were led by a handful of politicians and did not receive support from the democratic party as a whole . it should also be noted that the most serious impeachment effort , that against nixon , received bipartisan support .	
false	as teenage environmental activist greta thunberg found herself in the global spotlight in september 2019 , climate - change deniers sought to discredit her with a series of false rumors and doctored photographs . perhaps the most preposterous of these claims was that thunberg was actually an australian actress named estella renee who was delivering speeches on environmental issues not because she was concerned about the planet , but because she was a deep state crisis actor and paid to shill . <PARA> while researching this article we found at least three variations of the “ greta thunberg is an actress ” claim . they are as follows : <PARA> we ’ ll take a deeper look at each of these items individually . <PARA> greta thunberg is actually australian actress estelle renee ? <PARA> several social media users have claimed that thunberg is actually an australian actress named estelle renee . facebook user jack a . schulman , for instance , wrote : <PARA> this claim is nonsensical . <PARA> thunberg didn ’ t appear out of thin air in september 2019 to deliver a speech to the united nations . she ’ s been on the public radar since at least september 2018 when she started staging climate protests in sweden . thunberg has also been nominated for numerous awards ( including the nobel peace prize ), has met with several world leaders , and took a highly publicized voyage across the atlantic ocean . <PARA> furthermore , we know the identity of thunberg ’ s parents , svante thunberg and malena ernman , as well as her grandfather , olof thunberg , and her sister , beata . <PARA> in other words , greta thunberg is not a “ fictional character .” her journey to becoming a global environmental activist has been well documented . <PARA> greta thunberg has an imdb page . is this is proof that her environmental activism is disingenuous ? <PARA> a slightly less far - fetched version of this claim holds that thunberg is listed as an “ actress ” on her imdb page . while this is true , many have shared this screenshot as if it was somehow damaging to thunberg ’ s reputation as an environmental activist : <PARA> thunberg has one acting credit to her name . she lent her voice to a short film titled “ ave paraíso ” that was released in spain in 2019 . the remainder of her imdb page simply lists appearances she ’ s made on television programs ( such as “ the daily show ”) or in environmental documentaries where she is credited as herself . <PARA> the fact that thunberg has an imdb page is often shared along with the insinuation that her environmental beliefs are not sincere . however , it should be noted that being an actor does not automatically disqualify someone from having an opinion , being an activist , or having a political career . oscar - winner leonardo dicaprio , for instance , often lends his voice to environmental causes . arnold schwarzenegger and ronald reagan were both actors before embarking on political careers . even u . s . president donald trump is listed as an “ actor ” on his imdb page : <PARA> the website michael smith news noted one additional detail about thunberg ’ s imdb page that seemingly hinted at the notion that she was a paid actress looking for new gigs . the website wrote that “ you can talk to her agent if you ’ d like to book her for acting work ” and then linked to an imdb pro link . however , it doesn ’ t appear that michael smith news has access to imdb pro . when we checked greta ’ s listing on imdb pro , we found no listing for thunberg ’ s alleged agent . <PARA> does the viral video of a young climate protester crying feature actress estelle renee ? <PARA> thunberg wasn ’ t the only environmental activist to be accused of being an actor . the websites teaparty . org , the gateway pundit , joe for america , and the aforementioned michael smith news all published articles about how it was “ all a hoax ” and that the “ little girl seen crying in viral video ” at the global warming rally was really a child actress , “ a prop for the left ,” named estelle renee : <PARA> these articles are referring to a viral video from may 2019 of a young protester who broke down in tears while talking to reporters about climate change . the video in question can be seen in the second of the following tweets : <PARA> the young protester in this video , whose real name is estella brasier , does have a profile on the talent website star now . however , these websites provided no evidence that this person was paid to appear at this protest or to “ act ” that they were concerned about the environment . and as we noted above , the fact that a person has acted or is an actor does not disqualify them from having personal beliefs . <PARA> brasier ’ s father spoke to maarten schenk of the debunking website leadstories about this rumor :	
false	even those who don ’ t watch daytime television are generally familiar with one of its most successful and ubiquitous practitioners , psychologist phil mcgraw . better known as “ dr . phil ,” mcgraw and his wife , robin mcgraw , “ counsel millions of viewers on issues ranging from marriage and domestic abuse to addiction to weight loss ” on their top - rated daily program . <PARA> dr . phil ’ s popularity has brought him a fair share of criticism and made him the target of numerous celebrity rumors , the latter most frequently spread by the national enquirer and its sister tabloid , who over the last few decades have published several dozen articles accusing “ dr . phil ( and sometimes robin ) of various indiscretions , from minutia like being a ‘ ratings whore ’ to personal turmoil such as a ‘ secret divorce deal ’ to outright felonies like sexual and child abuse .” <PARA> so relentless has the national enquirer ’ s gossip reporting on dr . phil been that in 2016 , he and his wife filed a $ 250 million libel and malicious defamation lawsuit against the national enquirer ’ s parent company , american media inc . according to the washington post : <PARA> the mcgraws dismissed their lawsuit a few months later without providing any information about its ultimate resolution , but since then the enquirer seems to have stopped reporting negative rumors about dr . phil in favor of offering sensationalist , promotional articles about guests on his show . <PARA> nonetheless , one piece of gossip - mongering that has never gone away is the claim that dr . phil and his wife of 43 years , the former robin jo jameson , are headed for an imminent divorce — an event that , according to the enquirer , was forestalled only due to a “ secret divorce deal ” over a supposed “ tell - all book ” authored by robin : <PARA> the enquirer article quoted above was originally published in april 2009 , but neither a dr . phil divorce nor the publication of a robin mcgraw - authored “ tell - all book ” has transpired in the more than 10 years since then . although dr . phil continues to be dogged by divorce rumors , nothing other than tabloid reporting suggests such rumors have any substance to them . <PARA> the mcgraws addressed ( and denied ) tabloid reports of a pending divorce on their show as far back as 2008 , as transcribed on the dr . phil website : <PARA> in 2012 , dr . phil again denounced divorce rumors from “ stupid tabloids ,” this time during an appearance on the “ rachael ray show ”: <PARA> as recently as september 2019 , robin posted a “ happy birthday ” message to phil on instagram , including a photograph of the two of them posing in front of the famous pop art “ love ” sculpture , describing her husband as her “ forever love ,” and proclaiming that “ i love you more and more with every birthday ”: <PARA> obviously we cannot say with absolute certainty that any couple will not divorce at some point in the future . but although divorce rumors have swirled around the mcgraws for 15 years or more , those rumors appear to be driven by nothing more than fabricated tabloid gossip , and the mcgraws have expressed no interest or intent in divorcing , have vehemently denied such rumors multiple times , continue to work closely together , and present the outward appearance of a long - wedded couple who remain happy in their marriage :	
false	fear of pending outbreaks of biblical diseases may make for lots of story clicks , but that doesn ’ t mean the underlying claims are credible . <PARA> one such rumor floated online in september 2019 , driven by a backlash against homeless people . amid intense political and media focus on an ongoing housing crisis causing increased homelessness in major cities like los angeles , fear started to spread about a biblical disease . <PARA> the rumor stemmed from a september 2019 opinion piece penned by dr . marc siegel , a doctor of internal medicine at new york university ’ s langone medical center . in the piece published by the hill , siegel wrote that he feared immigration and a rising homeless population in los angeles could be the epicenter of a new leprosy epidemic . <PARA> that bit of sensationalism proved tantalizing for many media outlets , which ran with the claim despite the lack of supporting evidence . but if the idea of the dreaded new testament disease making a resurgence in hollywood sounds like the plot of a bad movie about end times , that ’ s because the claim is false . <PARA> the only piece of evidence cited by siegel was a paper about leprosy cases in los angeles . but dr . maria teresa ochoa , an associate professor of clinical dermatology at the university of southern california ’ s keck school of medicine and a co - author of that paper , told us siegel ’ s piece is inaccurate and also appears to exploit two political wedge issues : immigration and homelessness . <PARA> ochoa called the furor over a non - existent leprosy outbreak in los angeles “ the most ridiculous thing i have ever seen .” although siegel claims that most patients cited by the paper are latinos “ originating from mexico ,” and that therefore raises the specter of immigration driving a rise in cases , ochoa said that ’ s simply baseless . <PARA> “ we don ’ t talk about immigration or the homeless at all ” in the paper , she told us . “ i don ’ t have one patient [ with the disease ] who is homeless .” the reason most of the cases of leprosy cited in the paper were latino patients was because of demographics : the area of los angeles where the clinic is located has a large latino population . <PARA> ochoa added that mexico doesn ’ t have a major public health issue with leprosy . the countries with the biggest infection problems are india , brazil , and indonesia . <PARA> ochoa ’ s paper is a summary of 187 case files from l . a .’ s leprosy clinic between 1973 and 2018 . it does not warn of a looming epidemic nor posit an increase in cases . instead , it notes that although the disease is rare in the united states , leprosy ( also known as hansen ’ s disease ) still occurs . thus , medical professionals must be prepared to treat it . <PARA> ochoa said the biggest risk factor for contracting hansen ’ s disease is prolonged exposure to a patient who is contagious with it . leprosy is also difficult to catch . in 95 percent of incidents in which people come in contact with leprosy patients , those people do not contract the disease . <PARA> according to the los angeles county department of public health , “ no evidence [ exists ] of local transmission , [ and ] there is no risk for an outbreak .” in an email , an l . a . public health official said no cases of the disease have been diagnosed among the homeless . over the last decade , the county has seen between zero and four cases per year , averaging two cases per year . health officials further specified that leprosy is “ not highly infectious , but rather requires prolonged and close contact for transmission to occur . patients under treatment are not at risk for spreading disease to others .” <PARA> those with leprosy were a source of fear and scorn in the bible , but now the disease is treatable with antibiotics . experts now understand it ’ s caused by a bacteria called mycobacterium leprae that causes nerve damage if left untreated . “ we keep stigmatizing this diseases with false information ,” ochoa said . <PARA> siegel could not be reached for comment by the time of publication .	
false	a haunting photograph seemingly showing several women climbing the walls of a room in a dilapidated building is frequently circulated with the claim that it depicts an ( abandoned ) “ russian mental institution ” in the 1950s , or that it documents paranormal activity of ( dead ) people levitating : <PARA> neither of those explanations seems plausible : it ’ s unlikely that patients would be able to sustain themselves in an “ abandoned ” hospital , and footholds visible in the wall obviate the “ paranormal ” aspect of the picture . <PARA> in fact , this picture was taken from a performance staged by the late german dancer and choreographer pina bausch of her 1977 ballet “ blaubart ” ( based on composer béla bartók ’ s “ bluebeard ’ s castle “): <PARA> here ’ s a screen capture of the scene in question : <PARA> the eponymous bluebeard is not a pirate ( à la blackbeard ), but a character from a french folktale most famously set down in 1697 by charles perrault . <PARA> in that folktale , the titular character ’ s blue beard made him “ so frightfully ugly that all the women and girls ran away from him ,” yet he nonetheless managed to acquire a succession of wives — although “ nobody knew what had become of them .” bluebeard ’ s newest wife one day took advantage of his prolonged absence from home to explore a room in their dwelling she had been forbidden to enter , and there she discovered the remains of his previous wives . her perfidy given away by tell - tale blood on the forbidden room ’ s key , the wife was about to be killed by bluebeard when she was rescued by her brothers , who slew her murderous husband and thus paved the way for her to remarry a “ very worthy gentleman .”	
mixture	articles claiming that pepsi “ just admitted ” its brand of bottled water , aquafina , was “ plain old tap water ” have been circulating on social media for several years . in 2015 , for instance , the website true activist published the following passage : <PARA> several other websites have published similar articles . in september 2019 , more than four years after the true activist article was published , the yucatan times wrote that pepsi had “ just admitted that the water they are using is just tap water .” <PARA> while these articles are based on a genuine news report , they are also outdated and exaggerated . <PARA> these articles are referring to a 2007 decision by pepsico inc . to amend the label on bottles of aquafina to clarify that the water came from a “ public water source .” <PARA> reuters reported at the time : <PARA> while the water used in aquafina products comes from public water sources , that does not mean it is “ just tap water .” before this tap water is bottled , it goes through various filtration and purification processes . in other words , aquafina isn ’ t simply turning on the faucet and filling up bottles . <PARA> the aquafina website provides a little insight into how its water is purified : <PARA> it should also be noted that it isn ’ t uncommon for bottled - water companies to use public water sources . dasani , for instance , the bottled water produced by the coca - cola company , also uses public water sources : <PARA> a 2015 article from mother jones reported that 45 % of bottled water in the united states originates with the municipal water supply . the other 55 % comes from spring water : <PARA> to sum up : the water used in many bottled - water products , including aquafina , comes from a public water source . this water then undergoes various filtration and purification processes before it is bottled and sold .

false	u . s . president donald trump ’ s hair has been a subject of debate for decades . while there is photographic and video evidence that the president ’ s hair may not be as full as it once was ( he is , by the way , 73 years old ), we ’ ve also encountered quite a few fake photographs that purported to show trump as nearly bald . <PARA> in august 2019 , we encountered yet another example of follicle fakery . a picture supposedly showing trump ’ s badly thinning hair blowing in the wind was posted to reddit and imgur , along with a caption that apparently tried to push the picture into viral infamy via the so - called streisand effect : “ donald trump wants this picture removed from the internet . don ’ t share it !” <PARA> this is not a genuine photograph of trump , and the president has not made any public comments about having this image removed from the internet . <PARA> this manipulated picture is based on of a genuine photograph of trump snapped as he boarded air force one . the picture was taken in april 2018 by photographer evan vucci for associated press . a cropped version of the real image went viral after it was included in a buzzfeed listicle of “ 12 photos of trump boarding air force one on a very windy day .” <PARA> the original picture is available via associated press with the caption : “ president donald trump boards air force one for a trip to white sulphur springs , w . va , for a event on tax policy , thursday , april 5 , 2018 , at andrews air force base , md .

false	in august 2019 , we received multiple inquiries from readers asking about the veracity of an article that claimed norway had made it legal for humans to marry animals . <PARA> the june 2017 article was published on a cameroonian blog called the watch dog web and bore the headline “ norway : the marriage between humans and animals is [ sic ] been legalised !” it ’ s not clear what prompted a wave of social media sharing of the blog post more than two years later . another website , my africa today , published a short version of the story on aug . 22 , but it ’ s unlikely that accounts for the viral spread of the watch dog web ’ s version . <PARA> many of the facebook and twitter posts presented the watch dog web ’ s article , apparently in earnest , as a harbinger of a coming apocalypse . for example , a facebook page called true biblical christians shared the article along with biblical verses concerning the city of sodom , and “ the day when the son of man is revealed ”: <PARA> others made similar claims , writing that the story was evidence that “ jesus is soon to come ,” and “ the end is near ,” among other pronouncements : <PARA> the blog post read : <PARA> “ according to an article published in the norwegian newspaper dagens næringsliv of march 10 , 2017 , as well as several sites , norway legalized marital unions between humans and domestic animals ( bush animals and marine animals are excluded ). barbarä , a 23 - year - old woman who was met by a team of journalists , would be the first to celebrate a zoocontractual union . <PARA> “ barbarä trüdlosmek seems delighted to introduce her husband : rudolf , an abandoned doberman she found in an animal shelter in january 2015 and with whom she claims to be bound by a sincere and reciprocal love . they have already married .” <PARA> the article was a hoax that ultimately derived from secretnews , a french website that presents itself as satirical . along with the english - language version that went viral in august 2019 , the watch dog web published a french - language version back in june 2017 . <PARA> that version was almost entirely copied from secretnews ’ s original november 2016 article . the graphic below shows a side - by - side comparison of a section of the original post ( on the left ) with the version published seven months later by the watch dog web ( on the right ): <PARA> the only difference between the content of the two versions was that the watch dog web presented the fictional change in norway ’ s law as having already happened and the fictional “ barbara ” as having already married her dog “ rudolf ,” while secretnews said those developments would be coming soon . <PARA> additionally , the watch dog web falsely claimed to have based its report on a “ 10 march 2017 article in the norwegian newspaper dagens naeringsliv ,” a claim that secretnews did not make but that likely added to the credibility of the story for some readers , especially since dagens naeringsliv is a real norwegian newspaper . <PARA> finally , and most importantly , neither the english - nor french - language versions of the watch dog web ’ s article made it clear that the story had been lifted from a website that presents its content as “ satire .” the watch dog web did list “ secretnews . fr ” as a source , underneath its own article , but did not link to the original . therefore , only a reader who was willing to do some digging online or was already aware of secretnews would know of the “ animal marriage ” story ’ s satirical origins . <PARA> by contrast , secretnews does present its content as “ satire ,” although the disclaimer at the bottom of the website can only be reached if a reader scrolls down through a series of repeatedly refreshing advertisements , not something an average reader would do in the normal course of events . in any case , that disclaimer reads ( translated from french ): <PARA> “ secretnews is a free , independent , collaborative satirical publisher which involves several contributors . most of the information presented on this website is probably false , published with a satirical and humorous aim . it should not be taken seriously .” <PARA> so a fictional story published in 2016 by a french website that labels its content “ satire ” was picked up by a cameroonian blog in 2017 , embellished and stripped of its “ satire ” disclaimer , and then translated into english . the latter went viral in august 2019 , when american readers mistook it for real and shared it widely as supposed evidence of the imminent end of the world .

[ turning to the sky ] i am the chosen one . somebody had to do it , so i ’ m taking on china . i ’ m taking on china on trade , and you know what ? we ’ re winning ...” <PARA> the concept of a “ chosen one ” — an individual predestined by prophecy to perform the role of a savior or messiah for a particular people — has roots in various cultures and religious traditions , including christianity , judaism , and islam . however , it has evolved beyond those parameters to gain much looser and more secular connotations . <PARA> it is a common trope in fiction and literature , especially science fiction and fantasy ( think of harry potter ), and is also frequently invoked , sometimes with tongue in cheek , in the context of sports . for example , the basketball player lebron james famously had “ chosen 1 ” tattooed on his back , after sports illustrated published a cover story about him , describing the then - phenomenally promising high school junior as “ the chosen one .” <PARA> in theory , trump could have been seriously declaring a sincere belief that he is destined by prophecy to be the savior of the american people , or indeed the world , when he said as an aside “ i am the chosen one ,” during a discussion with reporters about u . s .- china economic relations . however , it seems much more likely to us , especially in light of his somewhat theatrical glance to the skies , that he was either using the phrase as a figure of speech born out of his apparently rather certain belief in his own talents , or that he was simply speaking with tongue firmly in cheek , or a little bit of both . <PARA> if the u . s . president refers to himself as “ the chosen one ” again , and with less ambiguous , more clearly messianic connotations , we will update this article accordingly . <PARA> ‘ the king of israel ’ and ‘ the second coming of god ’ <PARA> trump never declared or called or described himself as “ the king of israel ” or “ the second coming of god .” further , he did not even quote someone who personally professed that belief , and the person he did quote was not even claiming that others held that belief . as such , many sources , including those mentioned above , grossly misrepresented the pronouncements made in this episode . <PARA> however , in a decision that concerned many observers , the president did directly quote the conspiracy theorist and radio host wayne allyn root as saying that “ the jewish people in israel love [ trump ] like he ’ s the king of israel ” and “ like he is the second coming of god .” trump did this in a series of tweets , also on aug . 21 , which he prefaced by writing “ thank you wayne allyn root for the very nice words ”: <PARA> trump almost entirely accurately quoted remarks root made on his “ newsmax ” tv show on aug . 20 . in response to a caller who lamented the purported irrationality and blind loyalty of democrat voters , root held forth on the traditional support for the democrat party among jewish voters in the u . s ., in contrast with what he presented as widespread support for trump among jews in israel . he said : <PARA> “... 75 percent of all jews vote democrat and they don ’ t like trump . and this is the greatest president for jews and for israel in the history of the world , not just america . trump ’ s the best president for israel in the history of the world . and the jewish people love him like he is the king of israel . they love him like he is the second coming of god . and in america , american jews don ’ t like him . they don ’ t even know what they ’ re doing or saying any more , it makes no sense .” <PARA> the remarks in question can be watched here ( beginning at 36 : 45 ). root was echoing similar statements trump himself made earlier that day . speaking to reporters at the white house , the president addressed the controversy over israel ’ s reversed decision to bar u . s . reps . rashida tlaib , d - mich ., and ilhan omar , d - minn ., from entering the country . <PARA> trump proclaimed : “ where has the democratic party gone ? where have they gone where they ’ re defending these two people [ tlaib and omar ] over the state of israel ? and i think any jewish people that vote for a democrat , i think it shows a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty .” <PARA> root ’ s original remarks came in the form of a simile , meaning it should have been clear by definition that he was not claiming that trump actually is the king of israel or the second coming of christ , nor even that jewish people in israel believe he is those things . rather , in order to emphasize what he perceives as the u . s . president ’ s popularity among israeli jews , root was indulging in rhetorical license , using the device of a simile , by saying israeli jews loved trump as if he were the king of israel or the second coming of christ . <PARA> ( it is a matter for a separate discussion that the second component of root ’ s simile was woefully theologically illiterate . an important distinction between christianity and judaism is that judaism traditionally rejects the notion of christ as a messiah , thereby rendering the concept of a second coming inapplicable , and this part of root ’ s simile nonsensical by definition .) <PARA> root later emphasized the fact that he was engaging in simile , rather than claiming trump was , in fact , the king of israel or the second coming of christ , or even that israeli jews regard him as such . during a discussion with former fox news host bill o ’ reilly on root ’ s “ newsmax ” tv show , root said : <PARA> “... they [ liberal opponents ] took everything i said out of context ... did i really say , on national tv , on my ‘ newsmax ’ show last night , that donald trump is the second coming of christ , and he ’ s the king of the jews ? no . i said in israel they treat him like he ’ s the second coming of christ and the king of the jews . and it ’ s a new york expression , you know , it ’ s like you and i could have been having an expression [ sic ] and i ’ d say , ‘ are you kidding me ? in israel they treat him like he ’ s the king of the jews .’ does that really mean that i believe he ’ s the king of the jews ? ... obviously , i didn ’ t say that .” <PARA> we know that certain christians in the united states and beyond have professed a fringe belief in trump as a christ - like or messianic figure . it ’ s even possible , theoretically , that trump himself might harbor similar suspicions of his own destiny . but the series of statements he made on aug . 21 , 2019 , did not constitute evidence of any such belief on his part . <PARA> the president did say “ i am the chosen one ,” but he made the remark as an aside , combining it with a theatrical glance towards the heavens , while making a broader point about his engaging in a supposedly overdue trade war with china . the context , along with trump ’ s penchant for flippant and tongue - in - cheek asides , makes it highly unlikely he was choosing that moment to earnestly articulate some sincere belief in his own messianic destiny . <PARA> in a series of tweets , trump quoted a controversial conspiracy theorist , root , who had lavished praise upon the president , professing that jewish people in israel so admired trump that it was as though he was the “ king of israel ” or “ the second coming of god .” but root ( as he later confirmed ) was using exaggerated language as part of a simile . he was not making the factual claim that israeli jews literally believe that trump is the king of israel , or the second coming of christ ( the latter of which claims would make no sense for theological reasons , anyway .) <PARA> so the widely promulgated claim that trump , simply by quoting root ’ s remarks , was in effect declaring himself to be the king of israel or the second coming of christ , was inaccurate by a considerable distance . trump did not even quote someone who professed that belief , and the person he did quote was not even claiming that others held that belief .	
true	president donald trump has , since even before his election in november 2016 , made false or unfounded allegations of widespread voter fraud ’ s influencing the results and outcomes of major elections in the united states . <PARA> he has repeatedly claimed , without ever providing evidence , that his democratic opponent hillary clinton only won the popular vote as a result of mass - scale electoral fraud and promulgated baseless conspiracy theories about substantial voter fraud taking place in various 2018 midterm and statewide elections . <PARA> as president , trump established a commission to investigate potential large - scale electoral fraud , despite the absence of credible evidence that would typically justify such an action . the commission was disbanded without having found any such evidence . <PARA> more recently , trump claimed in august 2019 that he had only lost out to clinton in new hampshire in 2016 because the state was “ taken away ” as a result of “ thousands and thousands of people coming in from locations unknown [ to vote in new hampshire ].” he did not cite or provide any evidence to support those claims . <PARA> in the days following that latest baseless allegation of voter fraud , a letter was shared on social media that purported to have been written by ellen weintraub , chair of the federal election commission , and addressed to trump . it prompted multiple inquires from readers about its authenticity and provenance . <PARA> the letter , from a relatively important federal official to the sitting u . s . president , was unusually combative and is worth quoting from in full : <PARA> the letter was authentic . weintraub even posted it to her verified twitter account on aug . 16 : <PARA> three days later , weintraub discussed her letter and its contents in an interview with cnn ’ s anderson cooper :	
false	in august 2019 , we received several inquiries from readers about a popular piece of purported history : the origins of the humble corn flake . the new wave of interest in the invention of the popular american cereal appears to have been prompted by facebook and twitter posts that encouraged readers to “ ask google ‘ why were cornflakes invented ?'”: <PARA> for many readers , entering that question into search engines yielded a popular explanation for the origins of the cereal , excerpted from a 2018 article on the australian news website news . com . au which stated that “[ kellogg ] invented cornflakes in 1878 in the hope that plain food would stop people masturbating . mr kellogg , the man who created cornflakes , produced the cereal in the late 19th century and marketed it as a ‘ healthy , ready - to - eat anti - masturbatory morning meal ...'”: <PARA> the claim that john harvey kellogg created corn flakes for their supposed masturbation - suppressing qualities , and more specifically that he promoted the product as such , has been online for several years . several sources have presented the phrase “ healthy , ready - to - eat anti - masturbatory morning meal ” in quotation marks , giving readers the impression that those words originated with an actual advertisement for the cereal . <PARA> in reality , the phrase was never used by kellogg , nor was it ever used to promote or advertise corn flakes . it originated instead with a 2012 article by mental floss , which reported that “ kellogg developed a few different flaked grain breakfast cereals — including corn flakes — as healthy , ready - to - eat anti - masturbatory morning meals .” <PARA> when the product was first advertised in the early 1900s , it was by then being made and marketed by the kellogg ’ s cereal company , which was run by kellogg ’ s younger brother will after a rift formed between the two men , partly over the addition of sugar to the recipe ( john harvey was against it ; will was for it ). <PARA> those early advertisements made no mention of masturbation or sexual activities of any kind . they promoted corn flakes as “ nutritious and healthful ,” emphasizing in particular how easy they were to digest — one of their original uses at the sanitarium the brothers ran in battle creek , michigan . <PARA> however , the kellogg company also highlighted the flakes ’ “ delicious flavor and dainty crispness ” and encouraged consumers to indulge themselves , claiming the cereal would appeal to their “ sweet tooth ” and describing corn flakes as “ good for you no matter how much you eat .” <PARA> the supposed anaphrodisiac purpose of corn flakes also did not appear in john harvey kellogg ’ s patent application in 1895 . there , he instead emphasized the flakes ’ purported health benefits , describing them as being “ well adapted for sick and convalescent persons ”: <PARA> according to howard markel , a professor of the history of medicine at the university of michigan and author of a book on the kellogg family , the initial impetus for the invention of corn flakes came from the need to create a breakfast food that countered indigestion , a common health complaint in later - 19th - century america , while also conforming to the strict vegetarian diet of the seventh day adventist church , of which the kelloggs were active members : <PARA> so the best available evidence shows that kellogg ’ s corn flakes were created , patented , and marketed as a healthy , easy - to - digest cereal that would supposedly be appealing and of benefit to everyone , but in particular people with especially sensitive stomachs . the purpose of dampening masturbatory or sexual urges appears to have played no direct role in the origins of corn flakes . <PARA> however , an indirect link exists between the now - iconic american cereal and john harvey kellogg ’ s own eccentric ( and at times downright frightening ) views about sexual health . <PARA> kellogg was a medical doctor and health reformer , as well as a devout seventh day adventist . those strands of his personal and professional background came together in his views on sexual health , and in particular on masturbation — views that would now be regarded as pseudoscientific , not based on concrete evidence , and in some cases physically and psychologically harmful . <PARA> kellogg encouraged strict abstention from almost all forms of sexual activity or contact , even among married , heterosexual couples . he outlined these views in an 1887 book entitled plain facts for old and young : embracing the natural history and hygiene of organic life , which was reprinted and updated several times and enjoyed significant popularity in the united states around the turn of the 20th century . <PARA> kellogg devoted an entire section of the book to masturbation , which he referred to as “ self - pollution ” and the “ solitary vice ,” and described as “ the most dangerous of all sexual abuses .” that section of the book can be read in full here . <PARA> kellogg identified multiple purported causes and harms related to the habit of masturbation , many of which would appear laughably unscientific to a modern reader . among the causes he listed were “ exciting and irritating food ,” and stimulants such as tea , coffee , wine , beer , and tobacco . <PARA> he also listed several purported “ cures ” and “ treatments ” for the practice , one of which related to diet . kellogg believed a strong , direct link existed between the food and drink one consumed and the thoughts and urges one had . he outlined in the book what he described as “ the most simple , pure and unstimulating diet ” as a means to prevent or bring to an end a tendency towards masturbation : “ a man that lives on pork , fine - flour bread , rich pies and cakes , and condiments , drinks tea and coffee , and uses tobacco , might as well try to fly as to be chaste in thought .” <PARA> kellogg laid out five recommendations for the “ simple , pure and unstimulating diet ,” urging readers to : <PARA> john harvey kellogg did not create corn flakes either specifically or exclusively with the intention of dampening libidos across america or for the sole purpose of decreasing the prevalence of masturbation . the evidence available disproves that claim . <PARA> in particular , we know that kellogg and his brother were interested in creating an easy - to - digest , healthy , pre - prepared breakfast ; and we know corn flakes certainly weren ’ t advertised as an “ anti - masturbatory morning meal ,” contrary to the false claims of multiple online articles . <PARA> however , kellogg did have a broader , over - arching interest in simple , plain , bland foods — for the general health benefits he saw in them , but also specifically because he believed they could prevent or suppress sexual thoughts and urges , and he explicitly prescribed a “ simple , pure and unstimulating diet ” ( of which corn flakes could quite plausibly form a part ), as one of several methods aimed at preventing and ultimately eliminating the practice of masturbation .	
false	in late june , 2019 , university of california - davis professor frank mitloehner tweeted the ingredient list of three food items , two of which were popular plant - based burgers and one of which was “ premium dog food ”: <PARA> the point , mitloehner later tweeted , was that the two most notable plant - based imitation burgers , impossible burgers and beyond meat burgers , were “ indistinguishable from dog food .” from a factual standpoint , the three images accurately depict ingredient lists for ( from left to right ) a beyond meat burger , “ walk about dog food ” brand “ super premium ” grain - free vegan dog food , and an impossible burger . <PARA> let ’ s get into the weeds : 10 of the ingredients ( taking some chemical liberties and ignoring entirely the relative amounts of each ) of the 20 listed for the impossible burger can also be found among the 28 in the vegan , grain - free dog food : <PARA> in the case of the beyond meat burger comparison , both use peas as their source for protein . indistinguishability is perhaps in the eye of the beholder , but significant differences do exist between the burger - ingredient lists and the dog - food lists . <PARA> a broader question , though , is what scientific point does such a comparison serve ? one could make a similar argument that the ingredients in high - quality , organic beef dog food are “ nearly indistinguishable ” from canned beef chili served in the supermarket , but such a comparison wouldn ’ t be all that illustrative . indeed , like the beyond meat burger and the vegan dog food , the chili and the beef dog food both use the same protein source . <PARA> we asked mitloehner , who studies chemical emissions from animal agricultural practices and who has served as an expert witness defending the agricultural industry in the u . s . congress , what scientific point he was illustrating with his tweet . via email , he told us his concerns were with how the plant - based burgers were marketed : <PARA> asked about his interest in the topic , mitloehner told us it stemmed from “ the many media requests i receive about plant - based products including several [ media appearences ] alongside [ impossible foods founder ] pat brown and [ beyond meat founder ] ethan brown and the many factually incorrect claims they make about animal agriculture , which often otherwise go unchallenged in the media .” <PARA> the original conceit behind these plant - based burgers was one of sustainability : being able to produce something that tastes like meat using a process that could scale up and still be sustainable . as an example , this is why the impossible burger uses gmo yeast to produce a protein — heme — that could theoretically be produced by widespread soy cultivation . the amount of soy required to produce heme would not be sustainable in the long - run . ( beyond meat does not use gmo products and does not include the protein heme , which is touted as the key to impossible burger ’ s taste .) <PARA> these burgers are indeed often marketed as a healthy alternative to meat , and that assertion is a bit muddier . pound for pound , meatless burgers have comparable amounts of protein , and impossible burgers have the same ( or more ) vitamins , and minerals added , according to harvard medical school ’ s health blog : <PARA> on the negative side , these plant - based burgers also contain comparable , if not elevated , amounts of saturated fat , which can contribute to heart disease . additionally , mitloehner ’ s point about the level of processing in plant - based burgers is a valid one — many of the ingredients are heavily processed and appear to meet international standards for ultra - processed food — generally considered to come with a host of nutritional deficiencies . <PARA> in sum , there are shared chemicals in vegan dog food and plant - based burgers . in our view , two shared ingredients out of a combined 46 ( in the case of beyond meat ) or 10 shared ingredients out of a combined 48 ( in the case of the impossible burger ) do not meet the threshold for being “ indistinguishable ,” and as such we rank the claim mostly false .	
unproven	after the death of convicted sex offender jeffrey epstein in jail in august 2019 , reports emerged that claimed to detail an unusual choice of artwork in the disgraced financier ’ s new york city apartment some years earlier . <PARA> on aug . 14 , the daily mail reported that epstein “ had a bizarre portrait of bill clinton in a dress hanging in his manhattan mansion ,” adding : <PARA> “ the picture depicting the former president apparently lounging on a chair in the oval office , wearing red heels and posing suggestively in a blue dress redolent of monica lewinsky was in a room off the stairway of the upper east side townhouse . the dress is also strikingly similar to one worn by hillary clinton at the 2009 kennedy center honors .” <PARA> the mail included a photograph that an unnamed source claimed to have taken at epstein ’ s apartment in october 2012 , and that purportedly showed a view of the painting hanging on a wall through an open doorway . <PARA> clinton was an acquaintance of epstein ’ s , and his representatives had sought to distance the former president from him , after epstein was indicted on child - sex - trafficking charges in july . epstein was awaiting trial in a new york jail when he reportedly took his own life on aug . 10 . <PARA> the new york post appeared to corroborate the mail ’ s earlier reporting , citing unnamed “ law enforcement sources ,” one of whom purportedly told the newspaper : <PARA> “[ the painting ] was hanging up there prominently — as soon as you walked in — in a room to the right . everybody who saw it laughed and smirked .” <PARA> we received multiple inquiries from readers about the veracity of reports that epstein had once owned the painting , or that it was at one time displayed in his home . so far , we have been unable to independently verify that the artwork was once in epstein ’ s apartment . <PARA> the artist who painted it told snopes she did not know the identity of the person who bought it in 2012 and was unaware of any connection to epstein until a family member told her about news reports in august 2019 . <PARA> ‘ parsing bill ’ <PARA> this much we know : the painting shown in the photograph published by the daily mail is authentic . it is entitled “ parsing bill ” and was painted in 2012 by the australian - american artist petrina ryan - kleid , while she was obtaining a master of fine arts degree from the new york academy of art . as of aug . 15 , prints of the painting were available to purchase from the prominent online art gallery saatchi . a larger version of the work can be viewed here . <PARA> in april 2012 , ryan - kleid was photographed standing next to the work at the tribeca ball , an annual art exhibit run by the new york academy of art , and a popular event for new york socialites . ryan - kleid told snopes that ’ s where an unidentified buyer purchased the original work . in an emailed statement , the artist wrote : <PARA> “ in 2012 , as a grad student at the new york academy of art , i painted pictures of presidents clinton and bush as part of my master ’ s thesis . when the school put on a fundraiser at the tribeca ball that year , they sold my painting to one of the attendees . i had no idea who the buyer was at the time . as with most of my paintings , i had completely lost track of this piece when it was sold seven years ago . so it was a complete surprise to me to learn yesterday that it wound up in epstein ’ s home .” <PARA> ryan - kleid did not recall having sold the painting to epstein , specifically , and said she first heard about any potential link to the financier from a family member who had read the august 2019 news reports mentioned above . as such , she was not able to offer corroboration for those reports , or for claims that epstein had once had the painting in his home , or that the photograph published by the daily mail was in fact taken at epstein ’ s apartment . <PARA> until and unless further corroborating information becomes available , we are therefore issuing a rating of “ unproven .”	
mixture	in the aftermath of a spate of mass shootings in august 2019 , attention turned to u . s . president donald trump ’ s tone in discussing the killings , and the wider issue of gun violence in the united states , as well as his comportment in visiting two of the cities affected , el paso , texas , and dayton , ohio . <PARA> trump was criticized for smiling and offering a thumbs - up gesture while visiting an infant whose parents had been shot to death in a massacre in el paso , and allegations that the president was using the tragedies as an opportunity to gain political capital extended to unfounded rumors that his administration had hired “ fake ” medical staff to pose with him at a hospital in dayton . <PARA> on aug . 9 , the left - leaning facebook page occupy democrats posted a meme that purported to highlight a stark difference in tone and decorum between trump — who supposedly used a visit to el paso to brag about crowd sizes and snipe at democratic presidential candidate and former congressman beto o ’ rourke — and his predecessors in the oval office — who purportedly offered words of comfort and solidarity in the aftermath of previous mass shootings . <PARA> we received multiple inquires from readers about the accuracy of the meme , which read as follows : <PARA> the caption of the meme read : “ seriously , what is wrong with trump ?!?! he really said this to the el paso victims .” <PARA> the occupy democrats meme was a largely accurate recounting of four post - shooting statements made by the four most recent occupants of the white house . ( strictly speaking , trump was addressing medical staff who had treated victims of the el paso shooting , rather than the victims themselves , and the second quotation was , apparently in error , attributed to george h . w . bush , rather than george w . bush .) <PARA> despite the authenticity of the quotations , the meme presented an incomplete and rather misleading picture of trump ’ s overall comportment in visiting el paso after the august 2019 massacre there . while the president did indulge in side - sniping about a political opponent who had been fiercely critical of him ( something his predecessors markedly did not do in similar circumstances ), trump did also offer words of solidarity and comfort to the victims of the august 2019 massacres , their families , and the wider communities affected by the shootings . <PARA> clinton <PARA> the first quotation in the meme was taken from remarks bill clinton delivered in a white house press conference on april 20 , 1999 , the day of the columbine high school massacre in littleton , colorado . his speech can be read in full here , and viewed in full in the video below . <PARA> in the most relevant section , clinton said : <PARA> “ to the families who have lost their loved ones , to the parents who have lost their beloved children , to the wounded children and their families , to the people of the community of littleton , i can only say tonight that the prayers of the american people are with you .” <PARA> the second quotation in the meme came from a speech that george w . bush gave on april 17 , 2007 , during a convocation at virginia tech in blacksburg , virginia , the day after a student shot to death 32 people on that campus . the full text of his speech is available here , and it can be watched in full below . <PARA> in the section quoted by occupy democrats , bush said : <PARA> “ laura and i have come to blacksburg today with hearts full of sorrow . this is a day of mourning for the virginia tech community , and it is a day of sadness for our entire nation . we ’ ve come to express our sympathy . in this time of anguish , i hope you know that people all over this country are thinking about you and asking god to provide comfort for all who have been affected .” <PARA> obama <PARA> the third quotation in the meme was taken from a speech barack obama gave during an interfaith vigil at newtown high school on dec . 16 , 2012 — two days after a shooting massacre at nearby sandy hook elementary school in connecticut . <PARA> the speech can be read in full here , and watched in full in the video below . during the relevant section , obama said : <PARA> “ here in newtown , i come to offer the love and prayers of a nation . i am very mindful that mere words cannot match the depths of your sorrow , nor can they heal your wounded hearts . i can only hope it helps for you to know that you ’ re not alone in your grief . that our world , too , has been torn apart . that all across this land of ours , we have wept with you , and we ’ ve pulled our children tight . and you must know that whatever measure of comfort we can provide , we will provide . whatever portion of sadness that we can share with you , to ease this heavy load , we will gladly bear it . newtown , you are not alone .” <PARA> trump <PARA> the fourth and final quotation in the meme consisted of remarks trump made while talking to hospital staff during a visit to university medical center in el paso on aug . 7 , 2019 , four days after a mass shooting at a walmart store in that city . <PARA> police in el paso have linked the suspected shooter , patrick crusius , to a white nationalist manifesto posted online shortly before the massacre began . the author of the manifesto decried what he characterized as a “ hispanic invasion of texas ” and espoused the discredited “ white genocide ” theory . <PARA> although the manifesto ’ s author , thought by el paso police to be the suspected walmart shooter , stipulated that his anti - immigrant sentiment predated the elevation of trump to the presidency , some observers have pointed out areas of overlap between how the president talks about immigration and immigrants , and how the manifesto addressed them . <PARA> others , including democratic politicians and long - standing critics of the president , went further in connecting trump to the manifesto and the el paso shooting . u . s . rep . joaquin castro ( d - texas ) said the manifesto was so similar to trump ’ s rhetoric that it “ could have been written by the people that write trump ’ s speeches .” o ’ rourke described the massacre as “ an act of terror inspired by [ trump ’ s ] racism .” <PARA> conventional news media were not permitted to accompany the president and first lady melania trump on their visits with shooting victims , families and medical staff in dayton and el paso on aug . 7 , but amateur footage emerged later that showed trump addressing medical professionals at university medical center in el paso . <PARA> in the short clip , the president commended the work done by hospital staff in caring for the victims of the shooting , saying “ the job you ’ ve done is incredible ,” and “ it ’ s an honor to be with you .” without any obvious reason or prompt , trump then shifted to talking about a rally he had held in el paso in february 2019 ( although he mentioned “ three months ago ,” trump ’ s most recent rally in the city was in february , six months earlier ): <PARA> “ i was here three months ago and we made a speech and we had a — what was the name of the arena ? — that place was packed ... that was some crowd , and we had twice the number outside . and then you had this crazy beto — beto had like 400 people in a parking lot , they said , ‘ his crowd was wonderful !’ ...” <PARA> trump was referring in those remarks to a counter - protest held in response to his feb . 11 rally at the el paso county coliseum . the counter - protest was led by o ’ rourke and was estimated to have had between 7 , 000 and 15 , 000 attendees — considerably more than the “ 400 people in a parking lot ” claimed by trump . <PARA> during his rally , trump thanked the el paso fire department for allowing 10 , 000 of his supporters to enter the arena , despite the venue ’ s having a capacity of 6 , 500 . in response , a spokesperson for the fire department corrected the president , insisting that no special permission had been given , and the number of attendees inside the arena was no greater than its capacity . at other times , trump claimed that as many as 35 , 000 supporters had come to the rally , taking into account those outside the arena . <PARA> for an unknown reason , trump decided to re - open that six - month - old dispute and grievance over crowd sizes and news coverage , while meeting and praising hospital staff who had treated and cared for the victims of a mass shooting . that struck some observers as grossly inappropriate , and we found no record of former presidents obama , clinton or bush having engaged in similar behavior while meeting the victims of past shootings or the medical professionals who had treated them . <PARA> however , trump ’ s “ crazy beto ” aside was not the extent of his remarks on the massacres in dayton and el paso , and the occupy democrats meme misled readers by cherry - picking that unscripted moment and comparing it with remarks made by previous presidents from behind a podium , during prepared speeches . <PARA> in a white house address on aug . 5 , trump offered sentiments of solidarity and comfort to the victims of the dayton and el paso shootings and their families : <PARA> “ the first lady and i join all americans in praying and grieving for the victims , their families , and the survivors . we will stand by their side forever . we will never forget . these barbaric slaughters are an assault upon our communities , an attack upon our nation , and a crime against all of humanity . we are outraged and sickened by this monstrous evil — the cruelty , the hatred , the malice , the bloodshed , the terror . our hearts are shattered for every family whose parents , children , husbands and wives were ripped from their arms and their lives . america weeps for the fallen . <PARA> “ we are a loving nation , and our children are entitled to grow up in a just , peaceful and loving society . together , we lock arms to shoulder the grief . we ask god in heaven to ease the anguish of those who suffer , and we vow to act with urgent resolve .” <PARA> the salient difference between trump and his three most recent predecessors was not that they gave “ presidential ” speeches after mass shootings , because trump , too , gave a relatively dignified speech from the white house . the key difference , in the context of the occupy democrats meme , was in trump ’ s comportment and behavior when he stepped away from the podium . we therefore rate the truth of this meme as “ mixture .”	
false	on april 9 , 2019 , the website daily world update published an article positing that u . s . rep . ilhan omar , d - minn ., who is a practicing muslim , had proposed a nationwide ban on bacon : <PARA> this item was not a factual recounting of real - life events . the article originated from an online publication that is part of a network of websites and social media accounts ( america ’ s last line of defense ) whose content is self - described as humorous or satirical in nature : <PARA> “ everything on this website is fiction . it is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real . if you believe that it is real , you should have your head examined . any similarities between this site ’ s pure fantasy and actual people , places , and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical .”	
mixture	for most people , the word “ mass shooting ” invokes images of horrifying events such as the shooting at sandy hook elementary school , where 26 people ( including 20 children ) were killed in december 2012 , the massacre in las vegas in 2017 where more than 50 people were killed at a music festival , or the killing of more than 20 people at a walmart in el paso , texas , in august 2019 . <PARA> so when outlets such as usa today , cbs news , and yahoo news published articles with headlines such as “ el paso , dayton make 251 mass shootings in the us in 216 days , more shootings than days in the year ,” or “ there have been more mass shootings than days this year ,” some readers were a bit shocked by the numbers . <PARA> at the moment , no set definition exists for what is meant by “ mass shooting .” that means the number of mass shootings that occur each year varies greatly depending on the criteria used to count them . for instance , one organization may count a mass shooting if it involves four or more people who are injured by a gun , while other organizations may only count a mass shooting if it involves four or more people killed by a gun . these numbers can also be skewed by other factors . for example , some organizations don ’ t include crimes involving gangs or domestic violence in their mass - shooting reports , while others do . <PARA> the fbi itself has no set definition for “ mass shooting .” in 2005 , the government organization described “ mass murder ” as a single incident that results in four or more deaths . this standard was also used for a 2015 congressional research service report about mass shootings : <PARA> the claim that the united states had 251 mass shootings in the first 216 days of 2019 originates from data collected by the gun violence archive ( gva ), a non - profit organization that tracks gun - related violence in the u . s . the gva counts any incident in which four or more people were shot and / or killed . also , the gva list includes all incidents of gun violence , meaning that they don ’ t exclude incidents involving gangs or domestic violence : <PARA> the gun violence archive ’ s ongoing tally of mass shootings can be viewed here . as the gva only requires four or more people to be shot , and not necessarily killed , many of the shootings on this list don ’ t involve fatalities . as such , many of these incidents probably didn ’ t make headline news , which explains why so many people were shocked to see the number “ 251 ,” using gva ’ s criteria , for the first 216 days of 2019 . <PARA> beyond gva , others have tallied mass shootings differently . news outlet mother jones , for instance , has been studying mass shootings since a dozen people were killed in a movie theater in aurora , colorado , in 2012 . mother jones uses a stricter set of rules to define mass shootings . for that organization , a mass shooting is defined as an incident involving four or more people killed by guns . mother jones also excludes incidents that may stem from crimes , such as armed robbery or gang violence . <PARA> under mother jones ’ criteria , the number of mass shootings in the u . s for the first 216 days of 2019 is seven . <PARA> abc news used similar criteria for an august 2019 report on mass shootings in the u . s . the news outlet did not exclude shootings related to more conventional crimes , as mother jones did , and found that the u . s . had 17 deadly mass shootings in the same time period : <PARA> in sum , the question boils down to how “ mass shooting ” is defined . <PARA> when defined as any incident in which four or more people are shot , the number of mass shootings for the first 216 days of 2019 is above 250 . when mass shooting is defined as an incident in which more four or more people are killed ( and excludes domestic and other more conventional crime - related violence ) the number of mass shootings during that time period in 2019 is seven . if we include conventional crime - related incidents , such as domestic violence , the number of mass shootings is around 17 .	
false	some social media users have claimed u . s . rep . elijah cummings was in italy in late july 2019 , dining at a fancy restaurant in venice with other lawmakers . the claim went viral even though it ’ s untrue — the following tweet and others like it remaineded live on twitter despite spreading misinformation : <PARA> cummings , a democratic congressman who chairs the house oversight committee and has long represented baltimore , was indeed “ out of the picture ” — because he was thousands of miles away from italy . <PARA> pelosi ’ s office released a list of 13 members of congress who accompanied her on the trip , which was described as a delegation to visit the u . s . army africa headquarters in italy , and then to ghana to meet ghanian president nana akufo - addo and ghana ’ s speaker of parliament mike oquaye , among others . the american legislators also planned to “ pay respects at cape coast and elmina castles and the ‘ door of no return ,’ to observe the 400th anniversary of the first enslaved africans landing in america .” <PARA> the legislators who accompanied pelosi included “ majority whip james clyburn , chairwoman of the congressional black caucus karen bass , co - chair of the democratic steering and policy committee congresswoman barbara lee and icon of the congress , john lewis .” the list did not include cummings . <PARA> cummings has been the target of ongoing attacks from u . s . president donald trump and his supporters , which began when trump angrily reacted to cummings ’ criticism of his administration ’ s treatment of migrant children in u . s .- mexico border - detention facilities . trump took to twitter to attack the district cummings represents , which includes baltimore : <PARA> the false rumor that cummings was in italy along with other democratic leaders was spread by a number of social media users with large followings , including matt gaetz , a republican member of congress from florida : <PARA> this isn ’ t the first time gaetz spread misinformation online . in october 2018 , he helped launch a false , anti - semitic rumor that billionaire philanthropist george soros had paid central american migrants to travel in a caravan to the u . s . that rumor spread widely , and shortly afterwards , soros received a bomb in his mailbox . no one was injured in the incident . <PARA> cummings was not traveling with speaker pelosi ’ s delegation to italy and ghana in late july 2019 , so we rate this claim “ false .”	
false	in july 2015 , the world news daily report ( wndr ) entertainment website published an article about a 5 - meter - tall ( approximately 16 . 5 feet ) human skeleton that was unearthed in australia : <PARA> although this claim originated with a well - known entertainment website — a disclaimer on the site explains that all of its content is “ entirely fictional ” and satirical in nature — the above - displayed text and photographs continued to spread online by third parties . in 2017 , for instance , wndr ’ s content was repackaged into a video by the youtube page “ ufomania – the truth is out there .” a year later , the website sciencevibe passed this content off as if it were genuine news . in june 2019 , this content went viral again after it was shared by the facebook page historistic . <PARA> the above - displayed pictures , of course , do not actually show a 5 - meter - tall skeleton . these photographs were taken in france ( not australia ) in november 2012 and show an archaeologist excavating the remains of a woolly mammoth that was found at a quarry site near paris . <PARA> the top photograph from the wndr article is available via reuters along with the caption : <PARA> the other photograph shows the same woolly mammoth skeleton . that picture was taken by denis gliksman of the institut national de recherches archéologiques préventives ( inrap ) and is available on the french website sciences et avenir with the following caption ( loosely translated via google ): <PARA> these images do not show a 5 - meter - tall human skeleton that was unearthed in australia . these images actually show an approximately 150 , 000 - year - old woolly mammoth skeleton nicknamed “ helmut ” that was discovered near paris in 2012 . <PARA> this is hardly the first time that images supposedly showing “ giant human skeletons ” have gone viral online . we ’ ve previously written about several of these so - called “ discoveries .” to date , we ’ ve yet to come across any genuine photographs of an actual skeleton belonging to a real ancient giant human .	
false	in the summer of 2019 , we received renewed inquiries from readers about an unusual interpretation of the legacy of st . patrick , one that claimed the patron saint of ireland was responsible for the genocide of an african tribe who were purportedly the original inhabitants of that island . <PARA> the theory has given rise to many memes and social media posts that in recent years have been shared widely , especially around march 17 , the feast day of st . patrick . the memes are often accompanied by images that appear to show white men posing with african pygmies . <PARA> a typical version of the meme claims : <PARA> “ the twa pygmies of ireland , the original inhabitants . the source of [ the ] leprechaun legend . when you celebrate st . patrick ’ s day that ’ s the celebration of their genocide .” <PARA> the theory was neatly summarized by the author and speaker b . f . nkrumah in a widely shared facebook video in march 2018 : <PARA> the theory is not backed by any historical evidence , and as a set of factual claims , it can be dismissed . one prominent historian told snopes it was , simply , “ complete nonsense .” <PARA> the origins of the “ twa ” theory of irish prehistory are not entirely clear . however , it appears to be informed by what is sometimes referred to as “ afrocentrism ,” an approach to historical study that emphasizes the role and achievements of african people in the evolution of western civilization . the theory also seems to be influenced by euhemerism , an unusual strand of pseudohistory that was particularly popular in the 19th century . <PARA> the twa ( or “ batwa ”) are a people indigenous to the great lakes region of central africa . they are sometimes referred to as twa pygmies , an anthropological term denoting their relatively short stature . <PARA> although some exact details are lacking about the life of st . patrick , it is generally accepted among historians that he lived in the 5th century a . d ., grew up in roman - occupied britain ( probably in wales or the west coast of england ), was kidnapped as a boy and taken to the island of ireland as a slave for six years , then returned to britain . he trained as a christian cleric and went back to ireland as a missionary . <PARA> one of the legends attached to patrick in the centuries following his death was that he banished the snakes from ireland . this is not based in fact . no fossil records have shown that snakes were ever indigenous to the island of ireland , and the myth was likely a metaphor for the christianization ( and decline in paganism ) for which patrick and other early irish saints are credited . <PARA> the earliest archaeological evidence of human habitation on the island of ireland dates to between 10 , 640 and 10 , 860 b . c . no evidence exists to show that twa pygmies settled the island at any point in history , beyond which it makes little sense to imagine that a traditional hunter - forager people that emerged from landlocked central africa would have had the geographical awareness or technical knowledge to construct and sail ships thousands of miles northwest . <PARA> we found several iterations of the twa theory of irish prehistory . one version , published in 2007 by the website of the amen ankh community in kansas city , missouri , offered the following outline : <PARA> much of this account is simply incoherent , and the only would - be evidence put forward for the claim that st . patrick engaged in genocide against the twa is that the knotted hairstyle of twa and ethnic bantu peoples bears something of a resemblance to snakes . <PARA> this is a quintessential example of pseudohistory — starting off with the requirement of proving that twa pygmies were the original inhabitants not only of ireland but of the whole european continent , and then retrospectively finding any available connections ( even tentative symbolic links ), including links to a different cultural tradition to the central african twa pygmies , that of ancient egypt . this is not even to mention the unexplained and inexplicable introduction of hindu concepts ( kundalini and chakra ) into the theory . <PARA> another good example of this incoherence can be found in the same blog post ’ s explanation of how the purported etymology of the word “ leprechaun ” establishes a link between african pygmies and the island of ireland : <PARA> “ the word ‘ leprechaun ’ can be taken from several sources . breaking down the syllables and removing the vowels , you can reveal the earliest twa / nubian / kemetic origins : le - pr - rah ka - hn . le ( leo / lion / king ), pr ( house / temple ), re / ra - rah ( sun / leo / lion ), ka ( an attendant spirit supposedly dwelling as a vital force in a man or statue , the spiritual part of an individual believed by ancient egyptians to survive the body after death ). ‘ kahn ’ is a title for a sovereign or military ruler or chief .” <PARA> this is not how etymology actually works . for one thing , the purported etymological components of the word are supposed to amount to some meaning . that meaning is never provided in this case — are we to conclude that “ leprechaun ,” based on its egyptian linguistic roots , means “ lion spirit in a king ’ s house ”? or “ sun ruler of the lion ’ s spirit temple ”? the explanation fails woefully , even on its own terms . <PARA> moreover , this etymological analysis begins with the imposition of an unacceptable and arbitrary linguistic rule (“ removing the vowels ”), which the analysis itself promptly violates by including multiple vowels . once again , the supposed origins of the word “ leprechaun ” are claimed to reside in ancient egypt , not in the culture and linguistic history of the sub - saharan twa peoples . <PARA> so even if this etymological breakdown was accurate or logical , it would establish a linguistic link between egypt and ireland , not the central african twa pygmies and ireland . what implications would this have for the core claim that the twa were the original settlers and inhabitants of ireland ? <PARA> this type of goalpost - shifting and cherrypicking is typical of much pseudohistory , including afrocentrist pseudohistory . in her book “ not out of africa ,” the classical scholar mary lefkowitz described the afrocentrist push to claim for the ancient egyptians major intellectual innovations which belonged , in fact , to the ancient greeks : <PARA> “ afrocentrism is not simply an alternative interpretation of history , offered on the basis of complex data or ambiguities in the evidence : there is simply no reason to deprive the greeks of the credit for their own achievements . the basic facts are clear enough , at least to dispassionate observers . in effect , afrocentrists are demanding that ordinary historical methodology be discarded in favor of a system of their own choosing . this system allows them to ignore chronology and facts if they are inconvenient for their purposes . in other words , their historical methodology allows them to alter the course of history to meet their own specific needs .” <PARA> in reality , the word “ leprechaun ” is ultimately derived , relatively straightforwardly , from two roots : the old irish “ lú ” (“ small ”) and “ chorpán ” (“ body ,” from the latin “ corpus ”). <PARA> as well as elements of afrocentrist pseudohistory , the theory also shows signs of having been indirectly influenced by a relatively obscure pseudohistorical movement that was particularly popular in the 19th century . <PARA> euhemerism was an approach to folklore and mythology that sought to explain popular fairy tales and myths as being ultimately grounded in historical fact . it constituted an unusual combination of rationalism ( elves and fairies were not supernatural beings ) with pseudohistory ( the stories around them originated in an actual , historical race of pygmies that occupied parts of europe thousands of years ago ). <PARA> at least two recent accounts of the twa theory of irish prehistory cited a euhemerist text from 1911 , “ riddles of prehistoric times ,” a book written by james h . anderson , a retired attorney from iowa . anderson posited a broader theory of early pygmy races being the first settlers of several parts of the world , including ireland : <PARA> “ the first inhabitants of southern europe , northern africa , arabia , france and the british islands were a race of small men , who did not average in height more than about 4 feet 5 inches . they were of slight build , with dark complexion . they were cave - dwellers emanations [ sic ] from lemuria [ a fictional land mass in the indian ocean , similar to the mythical island of atlantis ] ... they were an african people , and there appears evidence that they sometimes practiced cannibalism . <PARA> “ it is said that the first people in ireland were the formatians . they were a dark , stunted race , utterly savage , using rough , unwrought stone implements . so far as can be learned , they did not know the use of fire . it is said they came from africa on ships .” <PARA> several points discredit this account and therefore any theory or historical claims based on it . firstly , the reference to lemuria as an actual , historical inhabited place ( as opposed to a mythical land mass ) is a red flag , as are anderson ’ s similar references to atlantis elsewhere in the book . <PARA> moreover , anderson refers to the “ formatians ” as the first inhabitants of ireland . we found no reference in any other historical accounts to such people , and the author probably intended to refer to the “ fomorians ,” who were a race of supernatural , villainous , sea - faring giants in irish mythology . they did not exist in history . <PARA> later in the book , anderson described the “ formorians ” ( a misspelling ) in the following way : <PARA> “ the ancient irish historians tell of ireland being settled before the flood by formorians [ sic ] led by the lady , banblia or kesair , her maiden name being h ’ erni or berba ... the formorians [ sic ] were said to be descended from noah ; they lived by piracy . their chief god was baal , bel , from whom belfast was named , the god of the sun ...” <PARA> in reality , the place name “ belfast ” ( the capital city of present - day northern ireland ) is derived from two irish words : “ béal ” ( meaning mouth ) and “ feirste ” ( a form of the word “ fearsaid ,” meaning “ sand - bank ford ”). the river mouth in question is that of the famous river lagan , on whose banks belfast is located . <PARA> those types of basic and glaring factual errors are scattered throughout anderson ’ s book , which also repeatedly presents mythological places and figures as having actually existed in history . present - day versions of the afrocentrist theory of irish prehistory , and st . patrick ’ s genocide of the twa pygmies , in particular , actually undermine their own credibility by citing accounts such as anderson ’ s as supportive evidence . <PARA> several versions of the theory also cite the work of an influential euhemerist , the scottish folklorist david macritchie . in particular , multiple present - day iterations of the “ african pygmy ” theory of irish prehistory refer to passages from macritchie ’ s two - volume 1884 book “ ancient and modern britons ,” in which he laid out the theory of a race of pygmies who populated ireland , britain and parts of scandinavia during the stone age . that theory has been discredited by the fact that no archaeological discoveries have ever substantiated it . <PARA> in one instance , macritchie attempted to draw inferences from the etymology of certain irish phrases , writing : “ that the wild tribes of ireland were black men is hinted by the fact that a ‘ wild irishman ’ is in gaelic a ‘ black irishman ’ (“ dubh eireannach ”). <PARA> however , the use of the word “ dubh ” in the irish language is complicated . literally , it means “ black ” or “ dark ,” but it has various somewhat poetic and figurative meanings when used as a modifier and prefix , such as in the phrase “ dubh eireannach .” in support of his etymological proposition , macritchie cited an 1825 irish dictionary published by the scottish lexicographer robert archibald armstrong . <PARA> that document lists dozens of compound words using “ dubh ” as a prefix , with widely varying meanings , for example : “ dubh - cheist ” ( literally “ black / dark question ”) for “ puzzle ”; “ dubh - fhocal ” ( literally “ black / dark word ”) for “ riddle ” or “ parable ”; and “ dubh - bhuille ” ( literally “ black / dark blow ”) for a “ fatal blow .” <PARA> it would clearly be a mistake , then , to interpret a given use of the word “ dubh ” as literally meaning “ black or dark in physical appearance ,” as opposed to having some other metaphorical sense . the very source used by macritchie himself establishes that much , and therefore undermines his etymological argument , as cited by many proponents of the present - day “ twa pygmy ” theory of irish prehistory . <PARA> moreover , even if the phrase “ dubh eireannach ” was intended to literally mean “ an irishman dark in appearance ,” it ’ s important to remember that racial spectrums vary between cultures , and what might have been regarded as dark complexion in stone age ireland would have been described very differently indeed by an inhabitant of africa at that time . <PARA> the “ african pygmy ” theory of irish prehistory , and in particular the theory of st . patrick ’ s genocide of the twa people , represent a fascinating , if confused and at times incoherent , jumble of various long - discredited strands of pseudohistory and euhemerized versions of irish , bantu , egyptian and other mythologies . <PARA> kairn klieman , an associate professor of history at the university of houston and author of a history of the batwa pygmies of central africa , dismissed the theory as a “ mish -

true	in july 2019 , a video supposedly showing a chicken being hypnotized went viral on social media : <PARA> this is a genuine , unaltered video of a chicken reacting to a line being drawn in the sand directly in front of it . however , while this practice is often described as “ hypnosis ,” dimitrios beredimas , an agronomist and blogger at strange animals , noted that it would be more accurate to say that this chicken is in a state of “ tonic immobility .” <PARA> this video appears to have originated on the insane monkey youtube page in april 2019 . that version was accompanied by the following description : <PARA> while many people may be seeing this chicken hypnotism video for the first time , this behavior has been acknowledged since at least 1648 , when it was mentioned in “ ars magna lucis et umbrae ” (“ the great art of light and shadow ”) by athanasius kircher , a german jesuit scholar : <PARA> so what ’ s happening here ? the video shows a chicken entering a catatonic - type state after experiencing a “ fear - potentiated response ” to a line drawn in the sand . this animal behavior is called “‘ tonic immobility ,” but readers may be more familiar with the colloquial terms “ playing dead ” or “ playing possum .” while this is typically a defensive mechanism , beredimas notes that the chicken isn ’ t particularly good at pretending to be dead : <PARA> since this phenomenon may be new to city folk , let ’ s take a look at a few other videos showcasing this technique : <PARA> if you have access to a chicken and want to try this , the strange animals blog provided the following instructions : <PARA> this isn ’ t the only way to hypnotize a chicken . other methods include swirling your finger in a circle around the birds head or tucking its head underneath its wing . the latter method was briefly mentioned in ernest hemingway ’ s posthumous 1985 book , “ the dangerous summer “: <PARA> while hemingway may be taking some artistic license with his “ an hour or more ” sentence , and although this trick isn ’ t guaranteed to work on all breeds of chicken , the above - displayed viral video showcases a technique to “ hypnotize ” chickens that has been used for centuries .	
false	on july 17 , 2019 , the junk news site america ’ s last line of defense ( allod ) published yet another piece of purported satire , this time reporting that u . s . house speaker nancy pelosi had blocked a bill that would have made english the official language of the united states . <PARA> under the headline “ pelosi stops bill to make english the official language of the u . s .,” allod reported that pelosi stopped non - existent “ house bill bt1138 ” authored by non - existent “ republican senator owen humperlamp of south dakota ” that would have “ legally and officially cemented english as the recognized language of the united states of america ,” rendering the bill “ deader than lavoy finicum .” <PARA> robert “ lavoy ” finicum was one of the leaders of a group of anti - government ranchers who occupied malheur national wildlife refuge in oregon during a 2016 protest that turned into a tense , prolonged stand - off . finicum was shot and killed by oregon state troopers after a confrontation with law enforcement on jan . 26 , 2016 . <PARA> allod consists of a number of websites and social media profiles operated by christopher blair who purports to proffer satire , although on many occasions audiences confuse the stories for reality . in one egregious example , a gretna , louisiana , police officer was so angered by a fake story published on one of blair ’ s sites that he posted it on his facebook page with an implied death threat directed at u . s . rep . alexandria ocasio - cortez . <PARA> on july 21 , 2019 , then - gretna police officer charlie rispoli shared a story from one of blair ’ s sites called taters gonna tate on his personal facebook page . the story was headlined “ ocasio - cortez on the budget : ‘ we pay soldiers too much .'” rispoli posted it with commentary implying that the democratic congresswoman from new york should be shot . rispoli and a second police officer who “ liked ” the post have since been fired . <PARA> in summary , the entire allod story about the english - language bill was fabricated .	
mixture	on june 30 , 2019 , the conservative commentary site daily wire ( along with several other news outlets ) ran a story with an entirely factual headline : “ city in ilhan omar ’ s congressional district votes to eliminate pledge of allegiance for meetings .” the city in question was st . louis park . that city is , as well - documented in daily wire ’ s reporting , located in minnesota ’ s 5th congressional district . and that district is indeed represented in the u . s . house of representatives by ilhan omar , an immigrant from somalia and one of the few muslims serving in congress . <PARA> omar , whose name is often invoked for the purpose of fomenting islamophobic fear mongering , had nothing to do with this decision . that decision was made by five individuals who are not ilhan omar , as described in local news report from june 26 : <PARA> still , daily wire ’ s social media postings misleadingly combined omar ’ s name and face with a quote from someone ( st . louis park ward 2 council member anne mavity ) who is not omar : <PARA> this led many readers and social media users to accuse omar of disrespecting america , at times producing not - so - veiled threats against her life on daily wire ’ s own facebook page : <PARA> as accurately stated in these articles , five city council members in st louis park voted to stop saying the pledge of allegiance before most city council meetings . none of those people , despite gratuitous use of her name and image in social media and in headlines , was ilhan omar .

false	convicted sex offender and hedge fund manager jeffrey epstein was arrested in new york in early july 2019 on various charges related to the sex trafficking of minors . as the news broke , many viewers noted that epstein had connections to several high profile politicians , including president donald trump and former president bill clinton . <PARA> the fact that donald trump had a friendly relationship with epstein — he told new york magazine in 2002 that “( epstein ’ s ) a lot of fun to be with ... it is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as i do , and many of them are on the younger side ” — prompted the circulation of a viral photograph purportedly showing epstein with donald trump and trump ’ s young daughter , ivanka : <PARA> this was not a genuine photograph , however , but a composite of at least two different pictures . <PARA> the first photograph , which features a young ivanka and her father standing next to a motorcycle , was taken in 1993 at the grand opening of the harley davidson cafe in new york city . this image is available via getty images , where it is offered with the caption “ donald trump and ivanka trump during grand opening of the harley davidson cafe at harley davidson cafe in new york city , new york , united states .

false	u . s . president donald trump ’ s fourth of july parade was both celebrated and criticized for its overt ( and expensive ) use of military vehicles . the event featured two m1 abrams tanks , an m2 bradley fighting vehicle , and , according to some confused social media users , a flyover by the russian military . <PARA> the idea that russian planes flew over the washington memorial during trump ’ s parade appears to stem from two items : a satirical article published in the new yorker and a typo from trump . <PARA> on july 3 , 2019 , humorist andy borowitz published a satirical article stating that trump ’ s parade would feature a flyover by russian su - 24 fighter planes : <PARA> this , of course , is not a genuine news article . “ the borowitz report ” is a popular satirical column by the humorist . a disclaimer stating “ satire from the borowitz report ” preceded this article , and the tags “ satire ” and “ humor ” followed after . <PARA> trump may have also contributed to the idea that russian planes would be involved in the fourth of july event . on the morning of the parade , trump posted a message on twitter that accidentally labeled “ air force one ,” the name of the united states ’ presidential plane , as “ aircraft one ,” which is the title of a documentary about russian president vladimir putin ’ s plane : <PARA> trump deleted the flyover tweet and replaced it with a message correctly labeling his plane as “ air force one .” <PARA> in sum , the russian military did not perform a flyover during president trump ’ s fourth of july parade . here ’ s a video showing the u . s . military flyovers during the “ salute to america ” event :	
mixture	misinformation spread on the internet in the wake of a rally in portland , oregon , where far - right protesters clashed with counter - demonstrators — violence that has become a reoccurring feature of the political landscape in the pacific northwest . <PARA> the far - right groups , patriot prayer and “ him too ,” held demonstrations on june 29 , 2019 , in downtown portland and were met by counter - protesters , including black - clad anti - fascists . as they have in the past , the events devolved into a series of street brawls . three people were arrested and eight people were injured , including three who were sent to the hospital , according to police . <PARA> right - leaning social media personalities and websites widely circulated an image of a bearded man with blood covering his face , identifying him as john blum and reporting that blum was the victim of a brutal attack by “ antifa criminals .” partisan media and a single picture didn ’ t tell the full story , though . <PARA> blum was hit in the head by a black - clad protester , and that injury caused bleeding . but after a widely shared narrative that he was heroically trying to help someone emerged , so did video showing that blum ( wearing a fedora hat ) was both carrying a baton and proactively engaged in a fight . <PARA> the man who shot the videos asked us to use only his first name , john , because of harassment directed at journalists who covered the event . john told us that in the chaos that has periodically roiled portland since the election of president donald trump , some people show up specifically to fight , and the late - june protests were no different . blum had swung his baton at people before getting hit over the head himself . <PARA> “ it was just really chaotic ,” john told us . “ there was a point where things had calmed down , and then someone threw one more punch , and it turned into another little scuffle . that ’ s when the older gentleman ( blum ) came at people who weren ’ t attacking him , i think two different people in the black bloc . someone responded by hitting him in the head [ from behind ].” <PARA> john , who identifies himself as an independent media worker sympathetic to the anti - fascists ’ cause , said that a sundress - wearing protester was attacked , but blum was not part of that altercation . “ it ’ s really kind of nuanced and mixed up . the idea that john blum was sticking up for this guy [ in a sundress ] is inaccurate , but there was an attempted attack on [ the person in the sundress ]. john blum was not part of that confrontation .” <PARA> he added , “ the idea that he ’ s some senior - citizen guy — yeah he ’ s obviously older , but that guy got around . he had no problem getting down . he didn ’ t look like he was super - fit , but he definitely had no problem trying to take on younger people .” <PARA> the twitter account that originally shared a video purporting to show blum being beaten has been suspended by the platform , though we are unsure why . we were also unable to locate blum online for comment . <PARA> the misleading victim framework that spread across the right - leaning media ecosystem is no surprise , said stanislav vysotsky , an assistant professor of sociology and criminology at the university of wisconsin at whitewater who has been researching political violence in portland . citing the work of sociologist mitch berbrier , vysotsky told us the “ victim ” narrative is an established framing technique used on the far right . <PARA> “ there is already a master narrative on the far right that they are victims , victims of people of color , of jewish conspiracies , feminists , all these things , so it ’ s very easy once you have this framework to paint yourself as a victim of left - wing thugs ,” he told us . <PARA> reality is more complicated , however . he places the most significant starting point for political violence in portland with a june 4 , 2017 , “ free speech ” rally planned by right - wing patriot prayer founder joey gibson one week after two men were fatally stabbed on a portland train by a white supremacist . the men had been trying to intervene as that white supremacist , identified as jeremy christian , berated two muslim passengers . the rally was scheduled despite the revelation that christian had attended a patriot prayer event , raising tensions . <PARA> since then , multiple incidents have contributed to an overall escalation of violence at various events staged by far - right activists , which draw opposition from counter - demonstrators , including anti - fascists . on may 1 , 2019 , members of the patriot prayer group showed up at cider riot , a bar in portland known to have left - leaning activists as patrons , and sprayed customers with mace , initiating a street fight . one member of gibson ’ s group hit a woman with a baton , fracturing a vertebrae , according a lawsuit filed by the bar . <PARA> also in 2017 , vysotsky said , the far - right adopted a new tactic of holding political events in liberal strongholds like seattle and portland to deliberately provoke a response . “ that was a shift in the politics of the far right , and this influence of the alt - right and the trolling culture . the protests became increasingly trolling events , where they are coming into the liberal territory basically saying , ‘ we ’ re far right , and we ’ re coming into your city , what are you gonna do about it ?'” <PARA> according to the anti - defamation league , “ both patriot prayer and proud boys espouse virulently anti - muslim views , are vocally pro - trump , and are known for their deliberate provocations of left - leaning west coast communities .”	
true	as the well - being of immigrant children in u . s . detention remained a focal point of controversy surrounding the trump administration in early summer 2019 , so did attempts to deflect blame to trump ’ s predecessor amid accusations of neglect and mistreatment . <PARA> during the previous summer , the trump administration ’ s “ zero tolerance ” policy of separating immigrant parents from their children was so widely rejected by both political parties that even first lady melania trump took the unusual step of repudiating it . in response to the backlash , u . s . president donald trump ( falsely ) pinned the blame for the child - separation policy on his predecessor , barack obama . <PARA> one year later , amid an ongoing national crisis of conscience over immigrant children incarcerated in detention facilities at the u . s .- mexico border , president trump again attempted to pin the blame on his predecessor . during a contentious interview with spanish - language network telemundo , trump wrongly stated that he had reunited families after they were separated by the obama administration . ( in fact , thousands of children were taken from their parents under the trump administration ’ s 2018 zero - tolerance policy .) <PARA> but then trump also attempted to deflect outrage over photographs of immigrant children being kept in “ cages ” by asserting , “ obama built the cages . i didn ’ t build them . obama built them ”: <PARA> that portion of trump ’ s commentary was true . pictures of children behind chain - link fencing were captured at a site in mcallen , texas , that had been converted from a warehouse to an immigrant - detention facility in 2014 . social media users who defended trump ’ s immigration policies also shared a 2014 photograph of obama ’ s homeland security secretary , jeh johnson , touring a facility in nogales , arizona , in 2014 , in which the fencing could be seen surrounding migrants there as well . that picture was taken during a spike in the number of unaccompanied children fleeing violence in central american countries . <PARA> johnson addressed the issue during a june 2019 interview with the non - partisan think tank the aspen institute : <PARA> johnson was referring to comments made by trump ’ s former acting ice director thomas homan ( who was director of removal operations at ice under president obama ). homan had said during a june 21 , 2019 , panel discussion hosted by the anti - immigration advocacy group center for immigration studies that “‘ the kids are being [ housed ] in the same facility built under the obama administration . if you want to call them cages , call them cages . but if the left wants to call them cages and the democrats want to call them cages , then they have to accept the fact that they were built and funded in fy 2015 .” <PARA> during the aspen interview , johnson said that use of the “ cage ” detention housing method was supposed to be temporary , and that under the law , children were only supposed to be kept in those facilities for 72 hours before being transferred to the care of the department of health and human services ( hhs ). “ but during that 72 - hour period , when you have something that is a multiple , like four times , of what you ’ re accustomed to in the existing infrastructure , you ’ ve got to find places quickly to put kids . you can ’ t just dump 7 - year - old kids on the streets of mcallen or el paso .” <PARA> the chain - link fences , johnson said , were to separate people by gender and age until they were released or transferred to hhs ’ s care . they are also present at a detention facility in clint , texas . <PARA> in early july 2019 , as questions about the health of children in border facilities intensified the trump administration was criticized for locking up young children in “ inhumane ” conditions for weeks , and for its overall treatment of immigrants in overcrowded detention facilities . democratic lawmakers who visited the facilities reported unsanitary , dehumanizing conditions . meantime , at least seven children had died in custody in the span of a year — an unprecedented number in recent history . <PARA> the lawmakers ’ accounts of what they saw coincided with a news story that revealed a secret facebook group consisting of border patrol agents who “ joked about the deaths of migrants , discussed throwing burritos at latino members of congress visiting a detention facility in texas , and posted a vulgar illustration depicting rep . alexandria ocasio - cortez engaged in oral sex with a detained migrant ,” as reported by propublica . <PARA> many of the children and families in federal detention are refugees fleeing a wave of violence in what is referred to as the northern triangle — guatemala , el salvador and honduras — with the united nations reporting that “ current homicide rates are among the highest ever recorded in central america . several cities , including san salvador , tegucigalpa and san pedro sula , are among the 10 most dangerous in the world .” <PARA> npr reported in march 2019 that the number of unauthorized entries into the united states via mexico had increased twofold over the previous year , filling detention centers beyond their capacities . the majority of those border crossings were by families .	
false	on the one - year anniversary of a large protest against the trump administration ’ s “ zero tolerance ” policy that separated migrant children from their parents , photojournalist ivan pierre aguirre posted photographs he took during the june 24 , 2018 , event in tornillo , texas . <PARA> one picture captured then - u . s . house of representatives candidate alexandria ocasio - cortez having an emotional reaction while looking through a fence toward a detention facility housing children . conspiracy trolls latched on to that image , claiming without evidence that the series of photographs from which is was taken were staged : <PARA> given that the detention of immigrant children has become a major point of national controversy , and that the obsession with ocasio - cortez among right - leaning media outlets has been fairly constant since her surprise election to represent new york ’ s 14th district in 2018 , it ’ s perhaps no surprise that dissecting the pictures for signs of alleged malfeasance became a new internet pastime . <PARA> “ the pictures were ridiculed particularly as there was no sight of actual migrant children during the protest ,” fox news reported . <PARA> that ’ s no surprise , aguirre told us . the roadway leading to the encampment was closed off to news media and protesters . “ obviously ,” he said , “ there weren ’ t kids two feet away .” <PARA> fox news also quoted a social media user voicing another critique , writing : “ excuse me while i take the time to put on bright red lipstick , a pristine white outfit and a movado watch before i go see little kids locked up in the desert .” <PARA> aguirre said the group ocasio - cortez accompanied to tornillo wore white as part of their protest . the rest of the criticism , he averred , seemed much ado about nothing . “ you can ’ t wear lipstick and be at a protest ?” aguirre said . “ her watch — ok she has a new watch . people are just criticizing everything .” <PARA> but the claim that got the most attention , pushed by viral conspiracy and junk news websites , made unfounded accusations that the photographs of ocasio - cortez were fake and that she was actually crying over an empty parking lot . russian state media outlet rt and zerohedge were among junk news sites taking a cue from alex jones ’ infowars network in that regard . the latter posted an unfounded story on june 24 , 2019 , that posited the “ empty parking lot ” conspiracy theory . <PARA> “ the photos show an emotional aoc holding her face and appearing to cry . her attention appears to be directed towards whatever is on the other side of the fence ,” infowars reported . “ however , a photo from a different angle shows there is nothing there aside from an empty parking lot and some police officers .” <PARA> the conspiracy theory was a low - effort jab that required viewers not ask what lay just beyond the camera lens or seek out additional , readily available information about the event . police weren ’ t guarding an empty parking lot , and the photographs weren ’ t newly uncovered . <PARA> the photographs touted by infowars were in fact those shot by aguirre , who posted them on his twitter account one year prior to infowars ’ “ newly uncovering ” them . <PARA> the so - called empty parking lot was in fact a roadway leading towards the tornillo border patrol station , where thousands of migrant children were housed in a tent city . <PARA> “ it wasn ’ t an empty parking lot ; it ’ s an entrance and we [ media and protesters ] weren ’ t allowed to go past that ,” aguirre told us . <PARA> he sent us another photograph in which the roadway and the fence blocking access to the migrant camp could be seen : <PARA> ocasio - cortez wasn ’ t the first or last person to get emotional after reaching that fence . “ she finally got to the fence and right beyond that road , way to the left , was the [ migrant tent city ] camp , and it represented something that made her emotional ,” aguirre told us . “ i ’ ve been out there , and some people get mad , some people cry , some people pray . no one questioned her [ when the photographs were posted ] last year .” <PARA> aguirre pointed out that during the 2018 protest he was on assignment for the texas tribune , and he — like most americans at the time — didn ’ t know who ocasio - cortez was . <PARA> “ it was just a genuine , found moment ,” he said . “ if we [ the news media ] weren ’ t there she still would have broken down , i think . she could see the entrance to the camps out in the distance .” <PARA> aguirre , a freelancer whose work has also been published by the new york times and associated press , told us the photographs of ocasio - cortez were just a few of many he captured at the protest that day , which some celebrities also attended , including singer sia , model amber heard , and actresses lena dunham and mira sorvino . <PARA> reporting that real but politically inconvenient events were actually staged is a long - standing practice at infowars . jones was successfully sued for defamation by parents of children who were slain in the 2012 sandy hook elementary school massacre after jones led his fans to believe the shooting was staged , and some of them relentlessly tormented those parents , believing them to be acting on behalf of a vague cabal seeking to undermine national sovereignty . <PARA> paul joseph watson , the infowars twitter personality who helped boost the bogus “ empty parking lot ” story , was also key in pushing unfounded claims in april 2019 that the fire at the notre dame cathedral in paris was intentionally set by muslims . <PARA> after our fact check was published , watson authored a second , equally misleading story claiming aguirre demanded watson remove the photographs from his posts because it was revealed ocasio - cortez was “ crying over nothing .” in fact , aguirre sent take - down notices to various publications and social media gadflies for copyright violations .	
false	in june 2019 , scammers attempted to swindle millions of social media users by presenting a movie - and television - streaming service called “ playjoltz ,” which spammy , fabricated online posts claimed was “ better than netflix ” and was available for free for ( you guessed it ) a limited time only . <PARA> we received multiple inquiries about playjoltz after it was promoted on facebook and twitter in almost - identical posts , each targeting readers from a different nation . <PARA> for example , on 25 june the website worldnews24 . co published a post with the headline “ there is a better service than netflix ... and it ’ s free for the canadian !” the article went on to report that : <PARA> “ the streaming giant netflix has lost thousands of canada users this week because of a new competing service which just came out and is lifetime free for the people living in north america ( us & ca ). the new service is called playjoltz and provides an identical streaming service to that of netflix but with a lot of extras . the users admit it is much faster , cleaner and with many more movies / series than netflix . they currently give a free access to the first 5 , 000 people who subscribe even though it seems they have almost reached this number . <PARA> “ with an almost unlimited selection of hd movies and tv series having an incredibly good image quality and that loads up at blazing speeds on all devices ( tv , smartphones , computers , tablets ), it is not surprising that thousands of people have already switched from netflix to this new service , playjoltz , since it has been launched 3 weeks ago . playjoltz informed us that the last day to subscribe for free is 27 june , 2019 .” <PARA> in parallel with that , the website austria - news . co targeted readers in austria , with the same claims and same text , this time in german . the scammers targeted readers in australia with another version of the same article , this time on australia - news . co , as well as a poorly produced facebook video that made the same claims : that the service was “ free for australians ,” and “ 100x better than netflix ”: <PARA> these articles were not only fakes but also appeared to be part of a long - running scam orchestrated from the country of cyprus , which has caused multiple users to be tricked into trying a “ free trial ” that they cannot end . users are encouraged to provide their credit card details for the free trial , on the understanding that they will not be charged if they cancel their subscription by the billing date . however , some users have complained of being charged repeatedly , even after canceling before the end of the free trial . <PARA> the various websites on which these articles appeared in june 2019 were littered with spammy links . for example , clicking on any link on any of the sites led the user to the same webpage , www . smushgame . com , which offered users a sign - up form for a streaming service similar to the one described in the playjoltz articles . <PARA> however , the smushgame . com homepage instead advertised a gaming service — “ unlimited access to all your gaming needs .” that homepage was registered to “ japalta consulting ” in the city of nicosia , cyprus . another website registered to a company in cyprus ( this time the city of limassol ) was playjoltz . com : <PARA> since 2018 , consumers from various countries have been reporting in online forums that they were swindled out of repeated , unsanctioned credit card debits after signing up for a “ free trial ” on both playjoltz . com and smushgame . com . both are scams . <PARA> the wave of playjoltz articles published in late june 2019 offered other clues about the unreliability of their claims . for instance , every article contained the same “ comments section ,” which was designed to resemble the facebook - linked comments section common to many sites . in reality , clicking on a “ username ” lead only to the smushgame sign - up page , rather than that “ user ’ s ” facebook account — a clear sign that the comments came from fabricated identities rather than the facebook accounts of real people . <PARA> similarly , every comment was gushing in its praise for playjoltz , and the exact same set of “ commenters ” left their positive reviews in each article , to the extent that they even appeared to comment in german , under the austrian version of the article . the image below shows the set of comments included under the canadian worldnews24 . co article , and on the right , those included under the austrian austria - news . co version : <PARA> finally , each of the june 2019 articles included a cover image that was designed to indicate that the existence of playjoltz , and the supposed sudden collapse of netflix as a result , was garnering mainstream television news coverage . the image featured a female news reader standing next to a giant screen that showed the netflix logo and the flag of whichever country was being targeted in each article , whether australia , austria , or canada : <PARA> in reality , these were digitally manipulated images of an irish news reader , who can be seen below wearing the same outfit as the one shown in the “ playjoltz ” images ( she is a co -

false	a photograph purportedly showing a couple sharing an intimate moment while watching the apollo 8 space shuttle launch in 1968 is frequently circulated on social media : <PARA> this is not a genuine photograph , but rather a composite of at least two different images . <PARA> the source photograph for the image of the couple was taken circa 2016 at the tretyakov gallery in moscow , russia . instead of watching the apollo 8 rocket launch , this couple was actually taking in a painting by ivan tsarevich called “ riding the grey wolf .” <PARA> while we haven ’ t been able to definitively determine the photographer , the chronicle magazine attributed this image to андрей строганов ( andrey stroganov ). here ’ s a look at the doctored image ( left ) and the original photograph ( right ). we flipped the doctored version to better match the original : <PARA> the rocket launch in the background of this image has little to do with nasa or the apollo 8 mission . this image actually shows japan ’ s h - 2a rocket taking off from the tanegashima space center in may 2010 . the original image is available via the associated press , along with the following caption : <PARA> here ’ s a look at the doctored image ( left ) and the original rocket photograph ( right ): <PARA> in sum , the viral image purportedly showing a “ couple watching the apollo 8 spacecraft launch in 1968 ” is actually a composite image comprising a 2016 photograph of a couple viewing a painting and a 2010 photograph of a rocket launch in japan .	
false	on 23 april 2019 , the christian satire site babylon bee published an article under the headline “ bernie sanders vows to round up remaining isis members , allow them to vote .” <PARA> employing a fake quote , the bee story stated that u . s . sen . bernie sanders , a 2020 presidential candidate and independent from vermont known for espousing democratic socialist policies and rhetoric , had declared during a town hall campaign event that “ as president , i will do everything in my power to hunt down each and every one of these terrorist scumbags , bring them to the u . s ., and allow them to vote in our elections .” <PARA> although the babylon bee website only posts made - up stories in their mission to “ write satire about christian stuff , political stuff , and everyday life ,” those stories are sometimes taken seriously by unsuspecting audiences , as demonstrated by the following tweet ( from which we have cropped the username out for privacy reasons )” <PARA> although the bee carries a “ satire ” disclaimer on its site , audiences still sometimes get confused about the nature of its material . for example , in april 2019 , readers were confused by a bee story that posited u . s . rep . alexandria ocasio - cortez ( d - new york ) was a contestant on the tv game show the price is right , where she guessed that products were “ free .” in february 2019 , the site ’ s output was similarly mistaken for real news in its reporting that empire actor jussie smollett had been offered a job at the cable news station cnn .

false	a startling image supposedly showing a tourist at yellowstone national park who received a face full of quills after taking a selfie with a porcupine is frequently circulated on social media : <PARA> when the image was shared in june 2019 , it was accompanied by a bit of text describing how this alleged “ touron ,” a derogatory term that combines “ tourist ” and moron ,” managed to get his entire face and torso covered in porcupine quills : <PARA> this is a genuine photograph that does not appear to have been digitally altered in any way . however , the image has nothing to do with “ tourons ,” yellowstone national park , or porcupines . this photograph was taken circa may 2018 in morocco and shows a student from the institute of fine arts in tetouan preparing for a performance art project . <PARA> according to the morocco news outlet le 360 , this student covered his body in plastic needles and then took to the streets of tetouan . the student ’ s appearance was so startling that he was eventually stopped by local law enforcement : <PARA> a few photographs of this student standing in a highly trafficked area with a police officer can be seen in the following video report :	
true	in mid - 2019 , right - leaning online forums and conservative , anti - abortion commentators shared a photograph that appeared to show pro - choice activists holding a sign likening fetuses to “ parasites ,” a comparison that outraged some observers : <PARA> on 22 may 2019 , the renowned princeton university political philosopher robert p . george posted that photograph to facebook , saying the placard , which read “ parasites don ’ t have rights ,” was designed to “ dehumanize unborn children ” and comparing it to the rhetoric used by nazis to describe jews during the holocaust : <PARA> the photograph was also published on the prominent right - leaning , pro - trump reddit forum “ the donald ” and right - leaning facebook pages such as “ god , guns and we the people ” and “ death by political correctness .” <PARA> we received several inquiries from snopes readers about the authenticity of the photograph and the wording on the placard . the photograph is authentic and was taken at a 19 may rally against abortion restrictions which took place in huntsville , alabama . <PARA> however , we have not been able to identify or contact the women shown in the photograph . as such , we cannot state definitively that their intention was to sincerely protest the abortion restrictions signed into law in alabama in may 2019 , as opposed to , for example , acting as agitators with the intent of undermining those protests ( although we have no evidence that the latter was the case ). <PARA> the photograph was one of several posted to the facebook page of an event called “ my body , my choice ” — a protest against house bill 314 , a bill that would make performing an abortion a felony and that republican gov . kay ivey signed into law on 15 may , prompting a wave of international scrutiny . <PARA> the protest took place on the afternoon of sunday , 19 may at butler green park in huntsville : <PARA> as further proof that the slogan was not digitally added or manipulated , we note that the same three women , one of them holding an identical sign , were also included in a second photograph published by the alabama news website al . com .	
false	in june 2019 , arkansas resident linda collins - smith , who served a single term in the arkansas state house of representatives and a single term in the arkansas state senate , was reportedly found dead of a gunshot wound inside her home in the city pocahontas . arkansas police said they are investigating her death as a homicide . <PARA> any death of a political figure in arkansas , regardless of cause , is typically quickly linked by conspiracy mongers to the decades - old “ clinton body count ” rumor , which holds that bill and hillary clinton have for years been involved ( with impunity ) in the murder of scores of people possessed of incriminating information about them . <PARA> typically , the deceased are claimed to have been on the verge of testifying against bill or hillary clinton at the time of their demises , thus necessitating hasty bump - offs .

false	during a visit to ireland on 5 june 2019 , u . s . president donald trump was confronted by a reporter with remarks made by irish president michael d . higgins , who had said trump ’ s decision to withdraw from the paris climate agreement was “ regressive and pernicious .” <PARA> in response , trump made a series of claims about the state of the environment in the united states under his presidency : “ well i haven ’ t heard those comments , but we have the cleanest air in the world , in the united states , and it ’ s gotten better since i ’ m [ sic ] president . we have the cleanest water , it ’ s crystal clean , and i always say ‘ i want crystal clean water and air .’ so , i haven ’ t heard his [ higgins ’] comments , but we do have — we ’ re setting records , environmentally .” <PARA> we asked the white house what the evidentiary basis was for the president ’ s claim that the u . s . has the world ’ s cleanest air , but we did not receive a response of any kind in time for publication . <PARA> it ’ s a claim trump has made before . in october 2018 , he tweeted “ america : the cleanest air in the world — by far !” along with a graphic that purportedly originated with world health organization ( who ) data : <PARA> the very source cited by trump in october 2018 actually contradicted his claim , and other reliable rankings of air quality place several countries ahead of the united states . as such , trump ’ s claim was false . <PARA> the map that trump tweeted out in 2018 showed “ annual average concentrations of ambient ( outdoor ) fine particulate matter .” it originated in an april 2018 report published by who but showed measurements that were taken in 2016 , a time when trump was not president and had no influence over u . s . environmental policy . trump was therefore , perhaps unknowingly , celebrating a level of air quality achieved under the presidency of his predecessor , barack obama . <PARA> specifically , the map showed concentrations of a type of air pollutant known as pm 2 . 5 — particulate matter ( pm ) with a diameter of around 2 . 5 micrometers . ( a micrometer is one - thousandth of a millimeter .) as the federal environmental protection agency ( epa ) explains , a pm 2 . 5 particle is around 30 times smaller than the diameter of a strand of human hair . <PARA> scientists and environmental authorities track the open - air levels of pm 2 . 5 and pm 10 ( particulate matter with a diameter of around 10 micrometers ) as two major measures of air pollution . <PARA> so the map that trump posted in 2018 , alongside his claim that the u . s . had the world ’ s cleanest air , was based on data that actually found in 2016 the u . s . had the 10th - lowest annual average concentration of pm 2 . 5 ., with 7 . 4 micrograms of pm 2 . 5 per cubic meter . in urban areas the u . s . ranked ninth , and in rural areas the u . s . also ranked 10th for pm 2 . 5 exposure : <PARA> 2016 concentration of pm 2 . 5 ( micrograms / cubic meter ) <PARA> according to another robust ranking , the united states also falls 10th among nations for air quality . the 2018 environmental performance index ( epi ) report on air quality , produced by yale university and columbia university , measures air quality in three ways : <PARA> the epi aggregated these three measures and arrived at a list of 10 “ leaders in air quality ,” with australia and barbados each ranked first and the united states ranked 10th : <PARA> clearly , the united states performs superbly well by several measures of air quality , as evidenced by its ranking among the top 10 out of almost 200 countries . however , president trump quite definitively and specifically claimed in october 2018 and june 2019 that the u . s . had “ the cleanest air in the world .” this is demonstrably false based on the most recent and reliable data available . those rankings could change in future years , but such changes would not alter the fact that trump ’ s sweeping claim was false when he made it , in both 2018 and 2019 .

true	a photograph supposedly showing the gravestone of a woman named kate mccormick , who passed away in the 1870s from a fatally botched abortion , has been circulating online for several years . in may 2019 , the facebook page “ american news x ” revived interest in the image : <PARA> this is a genuine photograph of a tombstone marking the grave of a woman who passed away in the 1870s after claiming she took abortion - inducing drugs , and we were able to corroborate many of the details of the inscription via contemporaneous news reports . <PARA> our one caveat with this facebook post is the stated date for when the tombstone was erected . while mccormick passed away in the 1870s , it wasn ’ t until more than a century after her death , in 1997 , that an anonymous donor placed the pictured gravestone on her final resting place . <PARA> the story of kate simpson ( aka kate mccormick ) <PARA> mccormick ’ s story can be gleaned from various articles published by newspapers in tennessee in 1876 concerning an inquiry into her death , the death of her child , and the doctor who was charged with ( and ultimately acquitted of ) providing her with abortion - inducing drugs . while these reports contained a fair amount of detail such as eyewitness testimonies , a few facts of the case are still a bit unclear . we have done our best to piece together the events that led to mccormick ’ s death , the trial of the man who reportedly killed her , and the circumstances of her burial below . <PARA> katie ’ s story starts in humboldt , tenn ., where she was seduced and impregnated by a shoemaker named george burgess . after becoming pregnant , burgess sent mccormick to memphis to have the child with the promise that he would soon follow to marry her . but burgess never followed . <PARA> in late january 1876 , a stillborn child was discovered at what news accounts referred to as “ mrs . widrig ’ s boarding house .” police arrived and found that the child ’ s mother , kate simpson ( alias kate mccormick ), was also deathly ill . she passed away the following day : <PARA> katie mccormick page 1 wed , feb 2 , 1876 – page 3 · public ledger ( memphis , tennessee ) · newspapers . com <PARA> the trial of dr . d . s . johnson <PARA> dr . d . s . johnson was arrested and indicted on three charges related to the death of mccormick and her child . the memphis public ledger described the charges against johnson in a 9 february 1876 article , stating that the doctor was indicted for administrating “ large quantities of deadly , dangerous , unwholesome , deleterious and penicious pills , herbs , drugs , potions , teas , liquids powders and mixtures ” with the intent of causing an abortion , for causing said abortion , and for “ feloniously , willfully , deliberately , premeditated and with malice aforethought kill [ ing ] and murder [ ing ] the said kate mccormick .” <PARA> a number of witnesses who were with mccormick in her final days provided testimony to authorities . widrig , the woman who ran the boarding house where the bodies were discovered , told authorities that mccormick had paid dr . johnson $ 25 to terminate her pregnancy . a woman named mollie brown provided similar testimony : <PARA> dr . johnson ’ s version of events differed . johnson , as well as two other doctors who visited mccormick before her death , testified that mccormick had been treated only for diarrhea : <PARA> johnson was eventually acquitted of the charges against him . <PARA> the burial of kate mccormick <PARA> the story of mccormick did not end with her death . while mccormick ’ s mother traveled to memphis after learning of her daughter ’ s death , she left the city without making arrangements for burial . similarly , burgess , the man who reportedly impregnated mccormick , didn ’ t undertake a visit to view the body . <PARA> a particularly depressing passage published by the public ledger on 4 february 1876 ( which contains some racial language common to the era ) noted that mccormick ’ s body was stored in a “ pauper ’ s coffin ” in a stable that served as a morgue for the impoverished in shelby county : <PARA> fri , feb 4 , 1876 – page 3 · public ledger ( memphis , tennessee ) · newspapers . com <PARA> the reporter who found mccormick ’ s body sought to remedy the situation by obtaining the help of a capt . george w . miller of the cut off saloon . miller agreed to finance a proper burial , and mccormick ’ s body was taken to elmwood cemetery : <PARA> fri , feb 4 , 1876 – page 3 · public ledger ( memphis , tennessee ) · newspapers . com <PARA> mccormick was interred at elmwood cemetery sometime in 1876 , but the gravestone shown above was not originally present at her final resting place . this tombstone was erected in 1997 and was paid for by an anonymous person who was apparently moved by mccormick ’ s sad tale . <PARA> the inscription on the stone reads : “ kate mccormick seduced and pregnant by her father ’ s friend , unwed , she died from abortion , her only choice . abandoned in life and death by family . with but a single rose from her mother . buried only through the kindness of unknown benefactors . died feb . 1875 age 21 . victim of an unforgiving society , have mercy on us .”	
true	former u . s . vice president and current contender for the 2020 democratic presidential nomination joe biden has a self - acknowledged reputation for making verbal blunders , one of the more infamous of which he uttered in a speech in danville , virginia during the 2012 presidential campaign . <PARA> that notorious statement was cited in a number of partisan social media posts in late april and early may 2019 ( shortly after biden announced his 2020 candidacy ) as an instance of his “ playing the race card ” to disparage republicans : <PARA> although it ’ s unclear , based on contemporaneous press coverage of the event , whether the audience was accurately described as “ predominantly ” or “ largely ” black ( more about which later ), biden did in fact utter the words attributed to him at a 14 august 2012 campaign attended by a racially mixed crowd , including hundreds of african americans . the following report is from the new york times blog “ the caucus ,” posted the same day as the event : <PARA> the moment was captured for posterity in a c - span video ( available here in its entirety ): <PARA> we would probably not be talking about this today had not biden ’ s remark been widely interpreted as a reference to slavery . as such , it drew instant condemnation , beginning with the romney campaign , which released a statement saying : “ after weeks of slanderous and baseless accusations leveled against governor romney , the obama campaign has reached a new low . the comments made by the vice president of the united states are not acceptable in our political discourse and demonstrate yet again that the obama campaign will say and do anything to win this election .” <PARA> romney himself echoed that statement in a speech he gave later the same day in which he held president obama responsible . “ his campaign and his surrogates have made wild and reckless accusations that disgrace the office of the presidency ,” romney said at a rally in chillicothe , ohio . “ another outrageous charge came a few hours ago in virginia . and the white house sinks a little bit lower .” <PARA> though he didn ’ t specifically mention race , romney accused obama of pursuing a strategy of divisiveness : <PARA> “ over the last four years , this president has pushed republicans and democrats as far apart as they can go . and now he and his allies are pushing us all even further apart by dividing us into groups . he demonizes some . he panders to others . his campaign strategy is to smash america apart and then cobble together 51 percent of the pieces .” <PARA> media pundits and campaign surrogates were more explicit in their criticism of biden . in an opinion piece for breitbart , conservative ben shapiro said the vice president ’ s statement was “ race - baiting at its finest .” former new york mayor rudy giulani , a republican , declared on face the nation that it was “ an absolutely blatant appeal to racism .” former u . s . senator rick santorum , also a republican , accused biden of “ play [ ing ] the race card .” <PARA> some democrats agreed with the criticism . “ first of all , without question they were appeals to race ,” said former virginia governor doug wilder . “ the important thing i got out of this was biden separated himself from what he accused the people of doing . as a matter of fact , what he said is they are going to do something to y ’ all , not to me . not us . so he was still involved with that separate american .” <PARA> cbs news reported that then - u . s . rep . charles rangel ( d - new york ) called biden ’ s comment “ stupid ” during a radio interview : <PARA> ebony contributor jamil smith agreed with rangel ’ s perception that biden was “ using the vernacular ,” or “ code - switching ,” as smith called it , “ to acclimate to a particular environment or audience .” phonetically rendered , this is what biden actually said : “ they gonna put y ’ all back in chains .” <PARA> but the vice president stood by the remark in a 14 august campaign stop in raleigh , north carolina , insisting that the message he was trying to convey wasn ’ t about race , but rather the negative impact the opposition party ’ s vow to “ unshackle wall street ” would have on middle - class americans : <PARA> biden had , in fact , used precisely the same trope before to characterize the impact of republican economic policies on the middle class . the day after a republican primary debate in october 2011 , biden said , referring to economic conditions under the george w . bush administration : “ the last time we liberated the economy under their proposals , the last eight years put the middle class in chains . my lord , how many times we have to go back to that horror movie ?” <PARA> president obama took biden ’ s side , defending his danville speech in an interview with people magazine : <PARA> the racial composition of the audience is relevant to this debate though not decisive , partly because estimates in the press were rough and contradictory . although it was consistently reported that approximately 900 people were in attendance , and we know , from both press reports and video of the event , that a significant percentage of the attendees were african - american , the media couldn ’ t agree on whether more black people were present than white people , fewer black people than white people , or roughly the same number of each . <PARA> the majority of mainstream news outlets reported that the audience was “ predominantly ,” “ largely ,” or “ mostly ” african - american . among these were the los angeles times , politico , cbs news , fox news , the daily beast , national public radio , and nbc news . significantly fewer outlets reported that the audience was “ about 50 %” african - american . some described it as “ racially mixed .” a small minority of venues said the makeup of the crowd was “ partially ” african - american . <PARA> we asked tiffany holland , a reporter who live - blogged the event for the richmond times - dispatch website , for her impression of the racial makeup of the crowd . “ if memory serves , the crowd was about half - african - american and half - white ,” she said in an email , adding that in her experience democratic party events in danville usually drew a “ healthy mix of diversity .” but she also said that this was just the impression she came away with , and could be remembering it wrongly . <PARA> in any case , even if only 50 percent of the attendees were african - american , biden would have found himself gazing out over an audience that included hundreds of black faces . the crowd need not have been “ predominantly ” african - american to inspire a politician inclined to do so to engage in racial pandering . <PARA> that biden uttered the sentence “ they gonna put y ’ all back in chains ” before just such a crowd stands confirmed . whether it should taken as a racially charged reference to slavery we leave it to readers to judge for themselves .	
mixture	in may 2019 , joe biden , former u . s . vice president and 2020 presidential candidate , came under renewed scrutiny for purportedly saying he had “ no empathy ” for the plight of younger people . <PARA> on 2 may , the twitter account <USER> posted a 16 - second video of biden on a stage and in conversation with an interviewer . the tweet contained the following excerpted quote : “ the younger generation now tells me how tough things are , give me a break ... i have no empathy ,” while the video featured a longer portion of biden ’ s remarks : <PARA> “... and so , the younger generation now tells me how tough things are — give me a break ! [ audience laughs and applauds ]. no no , i have no empathy for it . give me a break . because here ’ s the deal , guys — we decided we were going to change the world , and we did . we did ...” <PARA> the viral spread of <USER> tweet in may 2019 prompted several snopes readers to inquire about any wider context or meaning behind biden ’ s comments . <PARA> biden did indeed say he had “ no empathy ” for the plight of younger people , but he was not speaking in general or absolute terms . rather , he was making a specific , emphatic comparison between the relative progress and civility of the present moment , on one hand , and the upheaval and civil discord of his own youth , in the late 1960s . that important context was not shown in the viral 16 - second clip posted to twitter by <USER> <PARA> the former vice president made the remarks in question on 10 january 2018 , during his appearance at the los angeles times “ ideas exchange ” at the orpheum theatre in los angeles . his appearance was partly centered around his book “ promise me , dad : a year of hope , hardship , and purpose .” <PARA> the times published an edited , two - minute video excerpt of biden ’ s conversation with columnist and author pat morrison . it ’ s not clear what immediately preceded and followed those portions of the discussion , although the interview appears to have been wide - ranging and eclectic , according to two reports published by the times afterwards . the following is a transcript of the edited exchanges shown in that two - minute clip : <PARA> we were not able to obtain any more footage from biden and morrison ’ s conversation , but based on a summary of the event that the times subsequently published , there does not appear to have been anything within the discussion which would alter the meaning or sense of biden ’ s “ empathy ” remarks . <PARA> as shown in <USER> viral may 2019 video , biden did say he had “ no empathy ” for the plight of younger people . however , the 16 - second clip did not show the former vice president making a specific , emphatic comparison between the relative calm of the present moment and the social and political tumult of his own youth in the late 1960s . he was not saying , in absolute or general terms , that he had no empathy for younger people . <PARA> in omitting this important context , ibrahimas97 ’ s video gives an incomplete and somewhat misleading presentation of what biden actually said . <PARA> biden ’ s 2020 presidential campaign declined to comment for this fact check .	
true	in april 2019 , the christian conservative television network cbn news reported that a democratic member of the ohio state house of representatives had “ drafted a measure ” that would have excluded “ black babies ” from stringent new restrictions on abortion . <PARA> on 16 april , the website published an article with the headline , “ ohio democrat drafted measure to exclude black babies from being saved under pro - life law ,” which reported that : <PARA> cbn news ’ article prompted several inquiries from readers about the veracity of the claim that boyd had proposed excluding women and / or their children from the consequences of the legislation in question , on the basis of their race . <PARA> boyd did indeed propose an amendment that would have done just that , had it not been voted down in committee , and the core claim in the cbn news article was therefore accurate . <PARA> on 12 february , republican state sen . kristina roegner introduced senate bill 23 , which would in most cases prohibit abortions where a doctor finds evidence of a fetal heartbeat , an event that can happen relatively early in pregnancy , meaning the effect of the bill would be to ban a large proportion of abortions in the state of ohio . <PARA> the text of the bill stated : <PARA> the senate passed the legislation on 13 march , and the house of representatives followed suit on 10 april . ohio gov . mike dewine signed the bill into law on 11 april . the american civil liberties union ( aclu ) had already vowed to challenge the law in federal court , asserting that it was “ a direct violation of the constitution and a complete undermining of roe v . wade ,” the 1973 case in which the u . s . supreme court ruled that access to abortion was constitutionally protected under the fourth amendment right to privacy . <PARA> during a house of representatives health committee debate on 9 april , boyd , the democratic ranking member , proposed amending the legislation to effectively exclude african - american women from its restrictions and requirements , meaning doctors would not be obliged to test for a fetal heartbeat where the woman was african - american , and in such an instance , an abortion could take place even if a heartbeat was found . <PARA> the title of the amendment was “ exemption for african - american women ” and the text of the amendment read : <PARA> “ sec . 2919 . 1911 . african - american women shall be exempt from the requirements in sections 2919 . 192 to 2919 . 196 of the revised code .” <PARA> in proposing her amendment , boyd made somewhat unclear comparisons between the history of slavery in the united states and the abortion restrictions contained in senate bill 23 . she appeared to compare the control exerted over black women during slavery with the enhanced restrictions on women ’ s access to abortion contained in senate bill 23 , calling for black women , in particular , to be exempted from those restrictions , in light of that history . we contacted boyd ’ s office for clarification , but we did not receive a response in time for publication . during the hearing , boyd said : <PARA> the house health committee rejected boyd ’ s amendment along party lines , with all 11 republican members voting against it and all seven democrats supporting it .	
false	in april 2019 , many social media users reacted in shock and disgust as they came across tweets , facebook posts , and news articles reporting that nike had re - signed michael vick , a former nfl player who went to prison after pleading guilty for his involvement in a dog fighting ring , to an endorsement deal : <PARA> the linked news articles showcased in the graphic displayed above , announcing that vick had once again been tabbed to represent the sports apparel brand best known for its athletic footwear , are real . however , the npr and cnbc reports , as well as the change . org petition , were all originally published in 2011 . <PARA> michael vick entered the nfl in 2001 and quickly established himself as a top - tier player with the atlanta falcons , earning lucrative endorsement deals from companies such as nike ; but in 2007 vick was arrested and eventually pleaded guilty to his involvement in a dogfighting ring . in addition to drawing a 23 - month prison sentence , the former nfl quarterback was also dropped from many of his business partnership deals : <PARA> after serving out his prison sentence , vick returned to the nfl in 2009 , playing for the philadelphia eagles . a few years later nike re - signed vick to an endorsement deal , as noted in this excerpt from a july 2011 cnbc report ( which was re - circulated on social media in april 2019 ): <PARA> while it ’ s true that nike re - hired michael vick after he served his prison sentence for his involvement in a dogfighting ring , that news was already outdated by several years when it was widely presented yet again on social media in april 2019 . <PARA> vick officially retired from the nfl in 2017 , and it ’ s unclear if he still has any business ties with nike . we reached out to the company for more information and will update this article if more information becomes available .	
true	u . s . president donald trump ’ s immigration policies came under renewed scrutiny in march 2019 , when photographs emerged that appeared to show relatively large numbers of undocumented immigrants being housed behind wire fencing under a bridge in el paso , texas . <PARA> on 27 march , the website grit post published an article with the headline “ trump administration cages immigrants under bridge because detention center is full ,” which went on to report that : <PARA> that report prompted multiple inquiries from snopes readers about the authenticity of the photographs in question and the facts surrounding them . <PARA> on 27 march , miroff and moore did indeed post photographs showing the scene under the bridge . miroff gave the following description of one of the photographs : “ this is el paso right now , where hundreds of migrant families are being held in the parking lot of a border patrol station because there is no room for them inside , or anywhere else .” <PARA> for his part , moore tweeted : “ hundreds of migrants are being held under the paso del norte bridge in el paso , near the site of [ customs and border protection agency ] commissioner [ kevin ] mcaleenan ’ s press conference .” <PARA> setting aside the somewhat colored language used by grit post , which stated that the trump administration had “ caged ” the immigrants , we find the substantive claim — that crowds of undocumented immigrants had been detained under a bridge in el paso in march 2019 due to a backlog at the nearest official immigration center — was true . <PARA> on 27 march , u . s . border patrol spokesperson ramiro cordero largely confirmed the facts as presented by the post ‘ s nick miroff and bob moore , as well as in the grit post article , in an interview with the texas tribune . but cordero indicated that the typical time spent by immigrants at the improvised facility was relatively short . <PARA> the following are excerpts from the edited interview with cordero that the texas tribune published on 27 march : <PARA> on 28 march , the associated press published the following footage of the makeshift facility under the bridge : <PARA> at a press conference held close to the paso del norte bridge on 27 march , border commissioner mcaleenan said the u . s . immigration system ’ s “ breaking point has arrived ,” adding that the agency was facing “ an unprecedented humanitarian and border security crisis ” along the southwestern border , especially at el paso .	
false	on 22 march 2019 , the washington free beacon website accused u . s . rep . ilhan omar ( d - minnesota ) of “ holding a series of secret fundraisers with groups that have been tied to the support of terrorism , appearances that have been closed to the press and hidden from public view .” <PARA> although it ’ s true that omar in february and march of 2019 attended two fundraising events that were not open to the news media ( one for charity and one for her reelection campaign ), the events were not secret , nor were they hosted by groups “ tied to terror .” furthermore , a third event in which she spoke in front of a large crowd in los angeles on 23 march 2019 could hardly be mistaken for a “ secret ” one , as it was livestreamed by fox news . those facts didn ’ t stop an echo chamber of websites from reproducing similar headlines insinuating that a u . s . congresswoman was sneaking around holding furtive meetings with global terror - linked organizations . <PARA> omar is one of the first two muslim women to serve in congress . an immigrant from somalia , she is also the only member of congress to don a hijab , the head covering worn by observant muslim women . she has been the target of a slew of hoaxes and conspiracy theories , including unfounded claims she married her brother to game the u . s . immigration system , and false claims she made incendiary comments about white men . this fundraiser rumor is also not the first instance in which she has been falsely linked to terrorism . <PARA> free beacon reported that , “ omar recently spoke in florida at a private event hosted by islamic relief , a charity organization long said to have deep ties to groups that advocate terrorism against israel . over the weekend , she will appear at another private event in california that is hosted by cair - ca pac , a political action committee affiliated with the council on american islamic relations , or cair a group that was named as an unindicted co - conspirator in a massive terror - funding incident .” <PARA> those two sentences contained numerous falsehoods . for starters , free beacon conflated different organizations with similar names and relied on unreliable accusations or incomplete context to support their “ terror ties ” claim . <PARA> the event in florida was hosted by islamic relief usa ( irusa ). although irusa licenses the “ islamic relief ” name from the global umbrella organization islamic relief worldwide ( irw ), it is distinct from irw . irusa is a virginia - based , non - profit that operates in 40 countries to provide disaster relief and to fight societal ills such as poverty , hunger , and inequality . it is also one of the organizations that has participated in the u . s . government ’ s combined federal campaign , one of many charities that federal employees can select to donate to directly from their paychecks . <PARA> it was clear that free beacon conflated these two organizations , reporting that “ islamic relief has come under congressional investigation for what lawmakers have described as its efforts to provide assistance to terrorist group such as hamas and the muslim brotherhood . the charity has been banned by some countries as a result of these ties . in 2017 , congress sought to ban taxpayer funds from reaching the charity due to these terror links .” <PARA> all the references linked to by free beacon are about irw and not irusa , even though omar spoke at irusa ’ s 23 february 2019 benefit dinner to help raise money for famine victims in yemen . it ’ s unclear how the irusa event attended by omar could be construed as “ secret ,” because although it was not open to the news media , the eventbite page advertising the event noted that members of the public could rsvp to attend for as little as $ 15 . <PARA> and although it ’ s true that then - u . s . rep . ron desantis ( r - florida ) had pushed for an amendment to a spending bill that would have eliminated state department funding for irw , it died when desantis was not present to offer the amendment for a vote , citing the looming threat of hurricane irma . opponents of the bill , including then - u . s . rep . keith ellison ( d - minnesota ), argued the amendment was motivated by islamophobia , noting that irw had broad support from reputable relief organizations and a track record of working alongside various united nations agencies and european governments . <PARA> united kingdom - based irw was banned from operating in the united arab emirates and israel over terror accusations by the governments of those countries , which the charity forcefully denied . ( the british newspaper the telegraph termed the charges “ ludicrous and defamatory .”) furthermore , the u . s . government does not designate the muslim brotherhood , which is an international religious and political movement , as a terrorist organization . <PARA> free beacon demonstrated a similar problem conflating the prominent civil rights , non - profit organization council on american - islamic relations ( cair ) with a separate political action committee , cair california pac ( cair pac ca ). <PARA> on 24 march 2019 , omar spoke to an audience at a banquet hosted by cair ’ s los angeles chapter . the event was attended by an estimated 1 , 000 protesters , who demonstrated outside the hilton woodland hills venue as omar spoke . the event garnered widespread coverage from news media . <PARA> cair - los angeles executive director hussam ayloush expressed frustration about the characterization of the organization ’ s activities as “ secret ” or “ terror ”- related , telling us that they were unfair . “ for islamophobes , anything that muslims do is nefarious somehow . when muslims don ’ t engage [ in american politics and discourse ] they say , ‘ oh what ’ s wrong with them , they ’ re not integrating . they must have secret plans .’ and when we are engaging they ask , ‘ why are they engaging , they must have secret plans .'” <PARA> the day following the woodland hills event , omar spoke at a privately hosted political fundraiser in irvine , california , to benefit her reelection campaign . that event was sponsored by cair pac ca , a political action committee that supports candidates of its choosing . according to fliers advertising the fundraiser , the event was billed as a “ meet and greet ” with omar . the public could rsvp to attend by donating anywhere from $ 50 to $ 250 , upon which the address of the venue would be provided . <PARA> citing death threats directed at omar and the recent suspected hate crime vandalism of an escondido , california , mosque , cair pac ca president joe salas told us the event ’ s address was kept discreet out of fear for the congresswoman ’ s safety . but the event itself wasn ’ t “ secret ,” he said , and about 400 to 500 people attended . <PARA> “ we will open our events to the public when president trump opens his [ events ] down at mar - a - lago ,” salas joked , referencing similarly discreet campaign fundraising events that have benefited president donald trump . <PARA> accusations that cair has links to terrorism are long - standing , as are cair ’ s rebuttals that the effort to paint them as such stems from anti - muslim bigotry . the new york times documented in 2007 that : <PARA> the times also quoted retired fbi counter - terrorism agent michael rolince as stating , “ of all the groups , there is probably more suspicion about cair , but when you ask people for cold hard facts , you get blank stares .” <PARA> documenting a similar controversy in 2006 in which cair was accused of having terror links , the associated press reported : <PARA> the claim that cair was an “ un - indicted co - conspirator ” in a terror plot is incomplete and not new . the washington post analyzed it in 2011 , reporting : <PARA> free beacon reported that “ omar ’ s appearance at these closed - door forums is raising eyebrows in the pro - israel world due to her repeated and unapologetic public use of anti - semitic stereotypes accusing jewish people of controlling foreign policy and politics . with omar ’ s popularity skyrocketing on the anti - israel left , it appears her rhetoric is translating into fundraising prowess .” <PARA> estee chandler , founder of the los angeles chapter of the progressive organization jewish voice for peace ( jvp ), dismissed claims that omar ’ s commentary represents anti - semitic views . chandler , who supports omar and maintains her comments were directed at state policy and not the jewish people , accepted an award on behalf of jvp ’ s work at the irvine event at which omar spoke . <PARA> “ my rebuttal is that when they announced we were getting this award , jewish voice for peace got a fairly long standing ovation from this room of supposed anti - semites ,” she told us . “ it defies logic that anyone could characterize that room as anti - semitic .” <PARA> salas said that omar ’ s talk at the pac event in irvine wasn ’ t recorded , but that it didn ’ t contain any anti - semitic remarks . instead , he said , most of the crowd was composed of young activists who asked omar a lot of biographical questions about her road to congress . also in attendance were members of san diego , california ’ s , somali population and some members of the jewish community , he said . <PARA> we reached out to free beacon with emailed questions about their story but the publication declined to answer them .	
false	in the aftermath of the march 2019 christchurch , new zealand , massacre , in which a white supremacist fatally shot 50 people at two mosques , some observers turned their attention to the role of right - wing and xenophobic commentary in radicalizing violent white supremacists . <PARA> in a manifesto posted online before the attack , alleged shooter brenton tarrant singled out conservative american commentator candace owens as being “ the person that has influenced me above all ,” adding that she had “ helped push me further and further into the belief of violence over meekness .” <PARA> others criticized the role of social media and video - sharing platforms such as facebook , youtube , and twitter in facilitating the spread of far - right propaganda and allegedly not acting quickly enough to remove copies of the shooter ’ s live video of his rampage from their platforms . <PARA> against that backlash , a report emerged on 16 march that new zealand had taken the right - leaning fox news television network off the airwaves in response to their coverage of the mosque shootings . <PARA> the left - leaning website think progress published an article with the headline “ new zealand pulls murdoch ’ s sky news australia off the air over mosque massacre coverage .” <PARA> in reality , the government of new zealand took no action against sky news australia in the aftermath of the massacre . the attention - grabbing and highly misleading headline in the think progress article contrasted sharply with the more nuanced reporting in the body of that article , which read : <PARA> so in the body of their article , think progress clearly stated that an independent satellite television provider called sky new zealand , and not the new zealand government or state , had temporarily removed a television network called sky news australia from their platform . <PARA> sky new zealand is a private company and is not run by the government . there is no connection between it and sky news australia , apart from their similar names . <PARA> sky new zealand announced their decision on 16 march in a tweet : “ we stand in support of our fellow new zealanders and have made the decision to remove sky news australia from our platform until we are confident that the distressing footage from yesterday ’ s events will not be shared ...”: <PARA> however , as think progress correctly reported , sky new zealand deleted that tweet and subsequently replaced it with another , which removed the reference to “ distressing footage ” and re - framed the decision as being a collaborative one involving sky news australia itself : <PARA> “ we stand in support of our fellow new zealanders and are working with our colleagues at <USER> to ensure coverage doesn ’ t compromise ongoing investigations in [ new zealand ]. we made the decision on friday with sky news australia to replace their live news with sport ”: <PARA> the following day , sky news australia ’ s chief executive officer paul whittaker reinforced the claim that the decision to temporarily stop showing the channel on sky new zealand had been a joint one , as the guardian reported : <PARA> in the days following the controversy , some social media posts further distorted the reality by conflating sky news australia with fox news , due to their common connection to rupert murdoch , and falsely claiming that “ new zealand ” had taken fox news off the air : <PARA> sky news australia is owned by news corp australia , a subsidiary of murdoch ’ s news corp , and is part of the murdoch family ’ s global media “ empire ,” which in the u . s . includes fox news , the network rupert murdoch created in the 1990s . <PARA> finally , some social media users were also misled into thinking that not only had the new zealand government intervened against sky news australia ( or fox news ), but that the decision had been indefinite or even permanent , as implied by posts such as those shown above , which declared “ we should have done this years ago .” in fact , sky news australia was restored to the sky new zealand platform just a day after it was removed , according to sky new zealand .	
false	on 12 march 2019 , the facebook page american4truth posted a meme offering a purported quote from a new york politician named jenna tull : “ americans should be euthanized when they hit 70 . they just become too dumb ... and think of the money we ’ d save !”: <PARA> this was not a genuine quote from a real politician . for starters , we were unable to find any record of a democratic politician in new york by this name . new york has two u . s . senators ( chuck schumer and kristen gillibrand ) and 27 representatives , none of whom are named jenna tull . the name is also absent from a list of local politicians compiled by elections . ny . gov . <PARA> whoever created this meme most likely used the name “ jenna tull ” as a gag name in the tradition of “ seymour butz ” ( see more butts ), “ amanda hugginkiss ” ( a man to hug and kiss ), or “ mike rotch ” ( my crotch ). with this practice , the name jenna tull appears to translate to “ genital .” <PARA> furthermore , this meme does not depict a woman named jenna tull . the woman pictured in the image is ciara donlon , an irish entrepreneur and founder of the company theya healthcare . <PARA> the american4truth facebook page originally shared this meme along with a claim about how the fictional tull ’ s proposal would “ wipe out just about all the democrats leadership and majority of democrats in office .” while this is not a genuine quote from an actual politician , the democratic party does currently have more members over the age of 70 in congress than the republican party . <PARA> by our count , the u . s . congress comprises 23 senators ( 11 democrats , 10 republicans , 2 independents ) and 68 members of the house of representatives ( 51 democrats , 17 republicans ) above the age of 70 . while it ’ s certainly more democrats over the age of 70 than republicans are serving in congress , lawmakers of this age do not constitute a “ majority ” of either party . <PARA> we should also note that while democrats have more older politicians in congress , they also have more younger politicians . the washington post tallied the number of “ millennial ” members for both parties and found 16 democrats and 10 republicans under the age of 38 .	
mixture	a text meme supposedly showcasing the legislative records of various 2020 democratic presidential candidates — elizabeth warren ( ma ), cory booker ( nj ), kamala harris ( ca ), and bernie sanders ( vt ) — circulated on social media in march 2019 along with comments about how these lawmakers were ineffective at their jobs for their failure to pass more than a scant handful of bills : <PARA> the meme ’ s text was taken from a much lengthier post that was shared in a march 2019 newsletter from carl paladino , a former republican candidate for governor in new york who once said he ’ d like to see first lady michelle obama “ return to being a male and let loose in the outback of zimbabwe where she lives comfortably in a cave with maxie , the gorilla .” <PARA> in general , the meme used cherry - picked figures and omitted some crucial context concerning the legislative process in order to paint the referenced politicians in a negative light . for instance , while the meme focused on the supposed bill - passing ineffectiveness of these democratic politicians , its text contains no comparative information about how their numbers stack up against those of other senators . also , by the time the newsletter it upon from was published , the included statistics were already outdated . <PARA> let ’ s start with the meme ’ s central claim about bill passage . each year , only a small fraction of proposed congressional bills are voted upon and passed — a mere 443 bills were enacted out of the 13 , 556 pieces of legislation proposed during the 115th congress . that ’ s an 4 percent success over success rate for the entire u . s . congress , so the statistics offered in the meme aren ’ t nearly as egregiously bad as it suggests they are . also , the meme only included “ sponsored ” legislation , although lawmakers more commonly co - sponsor bills with other lawmakers . <PARA> the statistics in the meme were also a bit misleading because they didn ’ t factor in the impact of failed legislation on future laws . while one bill may not pass , many of its provisions may find its way into a later bill . <PARA> when govtrack . us compiles the legislative record of politicians , they consider an “ enacted ” piece of legislation as a bill that meets the following requirements : <PARA> when you count “ enacted ” legislation , here ’ s how these politicians stack up : <PARA> we compiled a few more statistics in order to more accurately show the legislative record of these senators . before we get to those numbers , we should note that the meme used the term “ passed ,” which is a bit vague and appears to refer to bills that passed the senate and not necessarily to bills that became law . <PARA> the following stats ( compiled via congress . gov ) show both the number of bills sponsored by each lawmaker that passed through one chamber of congress ( in direct comparison with the viral meme ), as well as the number of bills sponsored by each lawmaker that became law : <PARA> number of introduced bills passed by one chamber <PARA> number of introduced bills that became law <PARA> here are the statistics for the referenced politicians when you consider legislation that they have co - sponsored : <PARA> number of co - sponsored bills that became law as of march 2019 <PARA> finally , much of the meme covers senator bernie sanders ’ personal life . we debunked a number of those claims in a previous article , so we won ’ t repeat them here . <PARA> in summary , the stats used in this meme are outdated , cherry - picked , and presented without proper context . when one considers that the vast majority of legislation proposed by all lawmakers ends up on the chamber - room floor , the meme ’ s statistics appear far less shocking than presented . in other words , while none of these lawmakers has successfully sponsored many bills , that says more about congress as an institution than about these individual lawmakers themselves .	
false	among the many vexing problems with which the world continues to grapple is the issue of child marriage , a matter that predominantly affects girls in less developed countries . as the united nations population fund ( unfpa ) notes , 20 percent of girls worldwide are married before reaching the age of 18 , and in some parts of the globe the rate is twice as high : <PARA> unfortunately , social media platforms are full of inaccurate postings on the subject from persons who are not seeking to raise awareness of the child marriage issue , but simply to demonize other religions and cultures . the following is one such example of this phenomenon : <PARA> “ to all you misguided , uninformed liberal ‘ women ’ demonstrating in favor of embracing islam , this young lady is being sold into sexual slavery as a child bride . she is a christian . she watched her father beheaded and her mother raped . where is her safe place ?” the meme asks . <PARA> however , the blonde girl pictured here was not being sold into sexual slavery as a child bride by muslims ( or anyone else ), and no credible reports ( outside of the inflammatory meme itself ) suggested she was a christian who had seen her “ father beheaded and her mother raped .” <PARA> the image used in the meme originated with a ( no longer available ) video from 2013 that captured a 7 - year - old girl participating in a quran recital competition , as noted in a morocco world news article : <PARA> the referenced arabic canada website ( now defunct ) wrote of this picture as follows ( roughly translated from arabic ): <PARA> other screenshots from the video captured the girl looking considerably less distraught : <PARA> this isn ’ t to say that child marriage isn ’ t a real problem , or that it and other depredations — such as beheadings and rape — haven ’ t been perpetrated by those associated with isis , but the image used in this meme isn ’ t representative of any of those issues .	
true	social networks like facebook and twitter are often where the public expresses concern and even outrage over perceived miscarriages of justice . in recent years , internet users have been especially prolific in promoting awareness of a perceived tendency among some judges and prosecutors to seek and accept insufficient punishments for sexual crimes particularly against women and children . <PARA> one such case emerged in 2018 and 2019 and involved the prosecution of justin schneider of anchorage , alaska who , according to one internet meme , served no jail time despite having seriously assaulted a woman he picked up outside a gas station in august 2017 . <PARA> on october 2018 , facebook user ed stonick posted a widely shared meme that contained a photograph of schneider along with the following text , which some readers might find disturbing : <PARA> this fact check won ’ t examine the broader cultural issues raised by the meme and in other coverage of the schneider case , namely the extent to which the american criminal justice system is relatively indifferent to crimes experienced by indigenous women , such as the woman at the center of this case . rather , our article will evaluate the factual claims made in the meme . <PARA> much of the content of the meme is quite accurate , though it contains some errors . <PARA> on 8 august 2017 , schneider pulled up in his vehicle and approached a woman who was standing outside a gas station in anchorage . she entered his van and some time later , he attacked her , strangled her , masturbated over her and ejaculated on her , acts that schneider later admitted in a subsequent civil case brought against him by the woman . <PARA> using a license plate number provided by the woman , police tracked down schneider and arrested him on suspicion of first - degree kidnapping , first - degree harassment and second - degree assault . schneider initially pleaded not guilty to all three charges . <PARA> the woman claimed that schneider had invited her into his vehicle under false pretenses , calling himself “ dan ” and claiming to be an acquaintance of hers , allegations schneider continues to deny . she also claimed that he had strangled her to the point of unconsciousness . schneider has admitted strangling her , but denies doing so to the point of her losing consciousness . <PARA> despite facing three criminal charges , schneider and his attorneys were able to persuade the office of anchorage district attorney rick allen to drop the charges of kidnapping and harassment , in exchange for schneider pleading guilty to second - degree assault . <PARA> on 19 september 2018 , alaska superior court judge michael corey sentenced schneider to two years in prison , with one year suspended , and three years of probation , as a result of the plea agreement with prosecutors . however , because alaska law allows for time spent under house arrest to effectively be regarded as “ time served ,” schneider was not required to serve the 12 months remaining on his prison sentence . <PARA> after the sentencing , the state of alaska ’ s department of law provided the following explanation for the plea agreement and sentence : <PARA> in november 2018 , alaskans voted to recall corey from the bench , after a campaign that criticized his sentencing of schneider . speaking in march 2019 , corey said he and the prosecutors in the case were constrained by sentencing guidelines and alaska state law , and described the outcome of the case as “ a horrible result .” <PARA> also in november 2018 , the woman filed a lawsuit against schneider , seeking damages , compensation and legal fees and accusing him of assault and battery , negligence and inflicting emotional distress . <PARA> in his response to the civil complaint , schneider requested the case be dismissed but admitted to “ tackling , strangling and ejaculating on ” the woman , and accepted that he had “ intentionally or recklessly caused physical injury or emotional distress .” he denied having tricked the woman into entering his vehicle , and denied that she lost consciousness as a result of his strangling her . <PARA> as of march 2019 , the woman ’ s civil case against schneider was still before the alaska superior court . <PARA> the meme was accurate in stating that schneider had assaulted , strangled and masturbated over the woman — the core allegations against schneider , all of which he has admitted . however , schneider disputes the specific claim that the woman lost consciousness as a result of his strangling her , so we cannot definitively rule on the veracity of that particular allegation . <PARA> while the meme claimed that schneider was given one year ’ s probation , in fact judge corey gave him three years ’ probation . that ’ s a significant discrepancy , even if it does not change the view , held by many observers , that schneider ’ s punishment was woefully inadequate . <PARA> finally , schneider did serve some jail time in august 2017 , after his arrest and before his release on bail , but the principal claim in relation to his case is that his punishment did not include jail time . <PARA> so the meme ’ s claim that “ he was given no time in jail ” is mostly accurate , since corey did sentence schneider to two years in prison , but he suspended one year and credited the remainder of the prison sentence with the time schneider spent under house arrest while on bail . thus , the actual effect of schneider ’ s sentencing was that he did not have to go to jail as part of his punishment .	
mixture	on 12 march 2019 , u . s . president donald trump tweeted about a portion of a “ fox and friends ” television interview with a man named patrick moore . “ fox and friends ,” and by extension trump , claimed moore co - founded greenpeace : <PARA> people who adopt ostensibly oppositional views to their own perceived political background are popular fodder for punditry . the problem with this specific example is that moore did not co - found greenpeace . though he once was involved with the group , his views have diverged substantially since he left in 1986 . according to that organization : <PARA> moore was one of greenpeace ’ s earliest and more influential members , eventually serving as president of greenpeace canada . greenpeace , as an organization , has its origins in a voyage made by activists to the aleutian island of amchitka in a largely failed effort to stop nuclear weapons testing in the area . <PARA> these activists , who at the time called themselves the “ don ’ t make a wave committee ,” raised money and commissioned a vessel , the phyllis cormack , for this purpose beginning in 1970 . in march 1971 , as a graduate resource ecology student , moore applied for and was given a berth on the ship , later nicknamed “ the greenpeace .” in fairness , many people associated with these early days apparently describe themselves as co - founders of greenpeace . an archived greenpeace history page from 2007 , which lists moore under “ co - founders and first members ”, says : <PARA> moore left greenpeace in 1986 . speaking of that decision , moore wrote in 2005 : <PARA> in 2004 , wired magazine described moore ’ s shift away from greenpeace in more cynical terms : <PARA> moore is now or has been paid by several entities or causes that greenpeace now opposes . according to the climate media blog desmog : <PARA> in one notable media appearance , he defended the safety of glyphosate , a weed killer , by saying he could drink a quart of the product straight with no problem . when challenged to do so by the interviewer , he changed course , saying he wouldn ’ t because he ’ s “ not an idiot ” before abruptly ending the interview : <PARA> moore has also long been associated with a cadre of academics who consider themselves climate skeptics . in 2015 he was a speaker at a texas public policy foundation conference that included sessions like “ co2 is the gas of life ”, echoing the statements moore made on “ fox and friends ” in 2019 . <PARA> as moore states , it is true that co2 is a crucial building block of life that provides the raw material for plants to grow . this , in turn , provides animals with food and oxygen . however , such an observation , which you can find described in any middle - school science textbook , does not infringe upon the fundamental , physical truth that higher concentrations of co2 in the atmosphere will warm the planet . moore ’ s anti - climate - change statement on “ fox and friends ” is a bad - faith argument , and attributing such statements to a “ greenpeace co - founder ” is factually inaccurate .	
true	the history of the subjugation of darker - skinned peoples by western europeans is exemplified not only in the transatlantic slave trade that thrived from the 16th through the 19th centuries , but also in the phenomenon of global colonialism , which lasted even longer . <PARA> the colonies of africa were among the last to gain independence from european rule , most not until the mid - 20th century . among them was the belgian congo , a central african territory claimed by belgium ’ s king leopold ii for his personal exploitation in 1885 . leopold ’ s 23 - year misrule over his so - called “ congo free state ” was so flagrant that his own government wrested control of it from him in 1908 . it would remain a belgian colony until 1960 . <PARA> leopold ii introduced his countrymen to a colonialist tradition that would come to be known , in retrospect , as “ human zoos .” these were public showings (“ ethnological exhibitions ” was what they were called at the time ) of indigenous people plucked from their homelands , shipped across oceans , and put on display — usually in recreated “ native ” habitats , but also , in some cases , literally in cages — for the edification and amusement of mostly european audiences . they were very popular attractions at international expositions ( world ’ s fairs ) during the late 19th century and early 20th centuries , when smaller versions of the same could also be found in museums and traveling shows , in the united states as well as europe , featuring so - called “ primitive ” peoples from many different parts of the world , including the americas . <PARA> leopold mounted such a display on his estate in conjunction with the brussels international exposition of 1897 . what it was like and what it revealed about the deep racism implicit in the colonialist mindset was captured in a national public radio feature in september 2018 : <PARA> indeed , 61 years later , in 1958 , the spectacle would be repeated as if nothing had been learned in the intervening half - century . among the exhibits seen by visitors to that year ’ s brussels world ’ s fair (“ expo ’ 58 ”) was a reconstructed congolese village populated with hundreds of “ inhabitants ” brought over from africa . <PARA> some contemporaneous press accounts conveyed a sanguine impression of the quaint tableaux of native life presented in the congo pavilion . this is how it was described by an american visitor in the 30 may 1958 edition of the battle creek enquirer and news : <PARA> but a disquieting photograph taken at the exhibition reveals a darker side . the image often appears in historical retrospectives of expo ’ 58 and is frequently shared on social media as an example of colonial racism : <PARA> in the photograph , white exhibition - goers are seen interacting with a black child standing alone in an enclosure marked off by crude fencing . it ’ s unclear from the grainy image what the precise nature of that interaction was , but the standard description is plausible : visitors were feeding the child as one might feed an animal in a zoo . <PARA> the description “ human zoo ” is clearly apt in a figurative sense — the human beings on display were gawked at and to some extent treated like zoo animals , but the exhibition wasn ’ t billed or promoted as such . the congolese people who took part in it did so voluntarily and weren ’ t confined there . that they were free to go is demonstrated in what ultimately became of the congo village display — it was abandoned . <PARA> according to zana etambala , a royal museum historian interviewed by npr , the congolese people who played the roles of villagers in the congo pavilion had come to brussels under the impression that they were participating in a “ cultural exchange .” the experience proved to be anything but : <PARA> an account of the congo pavilion in the guardian , also from 2018 , noted that at a certain point the congolese packed up and went home : <PARA> film footage and photographs of the mock village ( including the now - infamous image of white tourists gawking at the congolese child ) were featured in a 60th anniversary retrospective aired by belgium ’ s flemish radio and television broadcasting organization ( vrt ). as noted in vrt ’ s online commentary , expo ’ 58 ’ s colonialist trappings apparently had the unintended consequence of accelerating the congo ’ s push for independence . <PARA> a backlash took place in the belgian press against the treatment of the congolese , as noted by historian gonzague pluvinage in his 2008 book expo 58 : between utopia and reality : <PARA> as it happened , members of the congolese intelligentsia also attended the fair as invited guests of the belgian government . among them , reportedly , was a political activist named patrice lumumba , who , upon returning to africa , helped found the congolese national movement , which immediately pressed for decolonization . <PARA> “ the fundamental aim of our movement is to free the congolese people from the colonialist regime and earn them their independence ,” lumumba would say in a december 1958 speech , mere months after the expo ended . “ we base our action on the universal declaration of the rights of man — rights guaranteed to each and every citizen of humanity by the united nations charter — and we are of the opinion that the congo , as a human society , has the right to join the ranks of free peoples .” <PARA> led by lumumba , who would become the nation ’ s first prime minister , the democratic republic of the congo declared its independence from belgium on 30 may 1960 .	
false	in march 2019 , “ america ’ s last line of defense ” published an article reporting that a cousin of u . s . rep . ilhan omar ( d - minnesota ) was one of the terrorists who hijacked flight 93 on 11 september 2001 , which ended with the aircraft ’ s crashing in a field in somerset county , pennsylvania , and killing all 44 people on board : <PARA> none of the four terrorists who boarded flight 93 on 9 / 11 was named “ alqadib aleimlaq ,” came to the u . s . from the united arab emirates , or was a cousin of rep . ilhan omar . ( three of the flight 93 hijackers hailed from saudi arabia and the fourth from lebanon , while rep . omar ’ s family is from somalia .) <PARA> this false report originated solely with america ’ s last line of defense ( llod ), a network of junk news sites that engages in puerile political trolling under the guise of proffering “ satire .” <PARA> the llod article falsely proclaiming rep . omar ’ s cousin to be a terrorist was quickly deleted after its publication , just as a similarly defamatory llod article positing that a u . s . army sergeant killed by terrorists in niger was a deserter was deleted .	
false	on 22 february 2019 , the facebook page for republican revival , a group whose purported mission is to “ help americans see through the progressive liberal bias ,” posted a photograph of bernie sanders , the u . s . senator from vermont who was once again seeking the democratic nomination for president . <PARA> the photograph showed a man being dragged off by two police officers and was accompanied by a caption proclaiming that “ in 1963 bernie sanders was arrested for throwing eggs at black civil rights protestors . this is the side of bernie that cnn and the fake news media don ’ t want you to know ”: <PARA> the photograph was one that surfaced during the 2016 presidential campaign and was verified at that time as a genuine picture of sanders being hauled off to a police wagon by chicago police — but the real back story to the image was the opposite of what the viral facebook post ’ s caption claimed . <PARA> the photograph was taken at a south side protest in chicago in 1963 , when sanders was 21 years old . according to the chicago tribune , sanders was charged with resisting arrest in connection with a protest against segregation in area schools , not for “ throwing eggs at black civil rights protesters ”: <PARA> when another photograph of sanders engaged in civil rights activism emerged in february 2016 , it was initially disclaimed as picturing someone else , but it proved to be a genuine image of sanders speaking to fellow core members at a sit - in . likewise , the arrest photograph was confirmed by the sanders campaign as a real picture of him : <PARA> chicago magazine also weighed in on story behind the photograph back in march of 2016 :	
true	in february 2019 , news websites in the united states and throughout the world reported that a relatively little - known english professor in the pacific northwest had “ branded ” disney ’ s classic children ’ s film mary poppins as racist . the london evening standard , for exaple , reported : <PARA> “ the classic family film ‘ mary poppins ’ has been branded racist by a us academic who accuses dame julie andrews of ‘ blacking up ’ with soot while dancing with chimney sweeps . in a piece for the new york times , professor daniel pollack - pelzner criticises one of the film ’ s iconic moments , when mary poppins joins dick van dyke ’ s bert to dance on a rooftop for the classic song ‘ step in time .'” <PARA> similarly , the uk - based metro news website wrote : <PARA> “ classic disney film mary poppins has been branded ‘ racist ’ by a university professor who believes the scene with mary and bert dancing with the chimney sweeps features blackface . in the 1964 film , mary and bert take jane and michael on an all - singing and dancing tour of london with bert ’ s pals that begins with them flying up through the chimney . famously , they become covered in soot and in a now infamous scene , mary attempts to wipe it off only to discover that she has made it worse , and so owns the soot and adds more to her nose and cheeks . however professor daniel pollack - pelzner , an english and gender studies professor at oregon ’ s linfield college , has now suggested that the scene in question is a reference to the original pl travers books which associated chimney sweeps ’ blackened faces with racial caricatures .” <PARA> that characterization of the much - loved movie prompted a bemused and even outraged response from some commentators , as well as enquiries from snopes readers about the authenticity of pollack - pelzner ’ s opinion column . one reader asked , “ is this real or satire ? it feels crazy to me ...” while another wrote , “ please tell me it ’ s a hoax !” <PARA> the opinion piece was indeed written by a professor of english literature at linfield college , a small private college in mcminnville , oregon . pollack - pelzner ’ s controversial column was published in the new york times on 28 january 2019 and was a straightforward effort ( i . e ., not intended to be satirical or humorous ). <PARA> in that column , pollack - pelzner pointed to the thread of questionable racial imagery and stereotypes that run through the series of mary poppins books authored by pamela lyndon travers and the classic 1964 film version , arguing that traces of that troubling material are echoed in the 2018 film sequel mary poppins returns : <PARA> pollack - pelzner , who studied history and english at yale and harvard , is an academic expert in shakespearean adaptations but has also contributed cultural criticism and theater reviews for major publications including the new yorker and the atlantic monthly .	
unproven	personal safety warnings are a frequent subject of viral social media posts , and in recent years human trafficking and sexual assault have increasingly become the focus of widespread fear among internet users in the united states — a phenomenon which we have examined in detail on several occasions . <PARA> many such warnings are no more than urban legends or unsubstantiated rumors , but they spread widely due to the fear they engender as well as the good intentions of many who pass them along . <PARA> in february 2019 , yet another such alert emerged on facebook , warning readers of “ the newest thing ” — men in texas and arizona administering date rape drugs to unsuspecting women by giving them tainted breath mints before trafficking them across the southern border of the united states , and into mexico : <PARA> no evidence corroborated the claims contained in the facebook post , that in early 2019 or late 2018 a pattern of incidents took place in texas or arizona whereby human traffickers drugged unsuspecting women using breath mints before transporting them against their will into mexico . <PARA> a spokesperson for the national sexual violence resource center ( nsvrc ) told us by email that “ we were not aware of the facebook warning you have shared , and we are not familiar with any cases of the behavior described ,” adding that “ the warning described does not seem credible ” and also “ perpetuates many misconceptions about sexual assault ”: <PARA> “ for instance , it suggests only women and female - identified individuals are targets of sexual assault . it also focuses on stranger danger , and we know that most people are sexually assaulted by someone they know . additionally , drug - facilitated sexual assault can be committed by someone you know and trust –- such as a friend or date . the most commonly used ‘ date rape drug ’ is actually alcohol , and in many cases it is voluntarily consumed by the victim who feels safe or trusts the person they are drinking with .” <PARA> similarly , a spokesperson for the southern arizona center against sexual assault ( sacasa ) told us that “ in southern arizona , we have not heard this come up from our hospital response advocates or crisis hotline staff ,” and a spokesperson for the safe ( stop abuse for everyone ) alliance in austin , texas provided this statement : <PARA> “... our sexual assault forensic nurses have not anecdotally heard anything related to that facebook post . they also mentioned that drugged patients aren ’ t likely to recall the delivery mechanism . while kidnapping does occur , most often traffickers target vulnerable or at - risk youth by pretending to love or care for them before turning and exploiting them and forcing them into prostitution .” <PARA> a spokesperson for polaris , the non - profit organization that runs the national human trafficking hotline , told us by email that traffickers do sometimes create or cultivate drug or alcohol dependency in their victims as a method of control , but that the organization did not have any evidence that would corroborate the specific claims made in the facebook post : <PARA> “ we haven ’ t seen any recent changes nationally or in texas and arizona that would suggest a shift in how substances like date rape drugs are being used . i haven ’ t seen anything that would necessarily disprove the post , but we also haven ’ t heard anything to validate the post either . as far as i ’ m aware , we have not received any recent reports of drugs disguised as breath mints being used in such a way as to facilitate trafficking across the border .” <PARA> in response to the contents of the viral facebook post , a spokesperson for the arizona department of public safety told us that its criminal investigations bureau was “ unaware of any such investigation .” <PARA> beyond the specific context of texas and arizona in early 2019 , it ’ s not implausible for “ date rape ” drugs such as gamma - hydroxybutyrate ( ghb ) or rohypnol to be surreptitiously administered via breath mints , but we found no evidence of a widespread pattern of such usage . <PARA> ghb is usually taken or administered as an odorless and tasteless liquid , which means it could in principle be applied to breath mints or lozenges and given to an unsuspecting victim . but in a “ date rape ” scenario ghb is usually added to a victim ’ s beverage , typically in the context of a bar or nightclub setting . <PARA> rohypnol is often administered as a pill , meaning that it could conceivably be presented as a breath mint to an unsuspecting victim — but again , it is typically dropped into an unsuspecting victim ’ s drink . <PARA> we found several reliable sources that outlined the fact that recreational users of drugs such as ecstasy , rohypnol , ghb and lysergic acid diethylamide ( lsd ) — that is , those who self - administer the drugs rather than “ spiking ” others for the purpose of incapacitating and sexually assaulting them — do sometimes use breath mint vials and containers to carry the drugs around in liquid or tablet form . however , this practice is not for the ultimate purpose of falsely presenting the drugs as breath mints to unsuspecting victims , but rather simply for disguising the drugs from law enforcement officers or nightclub bouncers . <PARA> despite conducting an extensive search of news archives stretching back decades , we found only one criminal investigation that bore a similarity to the “ breath mint ” incapacitation ruse described in the february 2019 facebook post . <PARA> in 2006 , police in tampa , florida , investigated the claims of a woman who said she had been subjected to a gang rape at a house in the city after being given “ gum that dissolved in her mouth .” the following newspaper account of the incident might be disturbing to some readers : <PARA> however , thirteenth judicial circuit court records show that the charges of kidnapping and sexual battery were dropped against all four suspects and no trial or conviction resulted from this case , so we cannot verify the claim that the woman was drugged using gum . <PARA> we cannot definitively disprove the specific claims made in the february 2019 facebook post , and as we have demonstrated , the use of a breath mint as a surreptitious delivery mechanism for an incapacitating drug is plausible in principle . we found no evidence of a widespread pattern of such behavior , though , and as a result we issue a verdict of “ unproven ” in this case . <PARA> however , it is highly unlikely that a spate of incidents in texas and arizona took place whereby human traffickers drugged and kidnapped women by offering them breath mints , all without the knowledge of several non - profit organizations dedicated to providing services to victims and survivors of human trafficking and sexual assault , as well as the state of arizona ’ s chief law enforcement agency . <PARA> the warning was posted to facebook by a single individual who did not cite any source , and its claims were not corroborated by any local , regional or national news reports , statements by law enforcement agencies , or the findings of any criminal investigations .	
unproven	on 1 february 2019 , the website thinkprogress . org reported that “ miriam adelson was awarded the medal of freedom after donating $ 500k to trump aides ’ legal expenses .” readers took note of that headline and asked whether it could be believed . <PARA> what is true is that dr . miriam adelson , a physician , and her republican mega - donor husband , sheldon adelson , gave millions of dollars to president donald trump ’ s campaign in 2016 and other gop candidates in 2018 . the adelsons poured $ 113 million into republican causes during the 2018 midterm - election cycle after donating $ 20 million to trump ’ s 2016 presidential campaign and $ 5 million toward his inauguration ceremonies . <PARA> according to irs documents available online , the adelsons also donated to the patriot legal defense fund trust , launched in 2018 for the purpose of helping trump associates who were prosecuted in an ongoing investigation into russian interference in the 2016 election with their legal fees . <PARA> the fund “ was formally established in the state of delaware on february 27 , 2018 , operating as a tax - exempt political organization under section 527 of the internal revenue code .” <PARA> whether dr . adelson was given the medal of freedom as quid pro quo for her family ’ s massive political contributions and gift to the legal defense fund is unknown . it is true she received the honor on 16 november 2018 , about a month and a half after she and her husband gave the patriot legal defense fund trust , llc , a total of $ 500 , 000 on 1 october 2018 : <PARA> according to the white house , president trump awarded dr . adelson the presidential medal of freedom , the nation ’ s “ highest civilian honor ” for her philanthropic efforts : <PARA> the award caused a stir among some of president trump ’ s critics . in an opinion piece for nbc news , columnist robert schlesinger wrote : “ the fact miriam adelson has also made the cut , however , perfectly captures the crassly transactional nature of donald trump and his presidency . because despite whatever adulatory nonsense trump conjures about adelson ( the white house press release notes her financial support of medical research and jewish causes ), the $ 133 million [$ 20 million to trump ’ s 2016 campaign and $ 113 million to gop candidates in the 2018 midterms ] elephant in the room is going to make [ the ] ceremony feel very crowded indeed .” <PARA> the other medal of freedom recipients honored at the ceremony comprised utah senator orrin g . hatch , former minnesota vikings football star ( and current minnesota supreme court justice ) alan page , singer elvis presley ( posthumous ), new york yankees baseball star babe ruth ( posthumous ), u . s . supreme court justice anton scalia ( posthumous ), and former dallas cowboys football star roger staubach .	
false	u . s . representative alexandria ocasio - cortez was the target of widespread scrutiny and criticism , mostly from right - leaning commentators , towards the end of 2018 and during the early months of 2019 , after she became the youngest female member ever elected to the u . s . house of representatives . <PARA> in particular , some conservatives took aim at comments the new york democrat made about income tax and wealth distribution , especially her proposal for a 70 percent marginal tax rate on high - income earners . <PARA> against that background , in february the conservative turning point usa group posted a meme that included a partial quotation attributed to ocasio - cortez : “‘ a society that allows billionaires to exist ... is wrong .’ — alexandria ocasio - cortez ”: <PARA> in reality , that quotation was a grossly misleading representation of remarks ocasio - cortez made on 21 january 2019 during a wide - ranging interview with the writer ta - nehisi coates as part of the 2019 “ mlk now ” event in harlem , new york . <PARA> in one section of that interview , coates and ocasio - cortez discussed issues around taxation , income inequality , and economic justice . ocasio - cortez framed the issue of the marginal tax rate in the following way : <PARA> “ it ’ s an economic question but it ’ s also a moral question . [ the 70 percent marginal tax rate ] is the policy translation of a proposed answer to ‘ what kind of society do we want to live in ?’ are we comfortable with a society where someone can have a personal helipad while this city [ new york ] is experiencing the highest rates of people experiencing homelessness since the great depression ? should those two things coexist at the same time ?” <PARA> here is a transcript of a later section of that discussion , the one most relevant to the turning point usa meme : <PARA> so it ’ s true that ocasio - cortez did say “ a system that allows billionaires to exist ... is wrong ,” but what that selective quotation left out — the section in the middle — was crucial . she said , infull : “ i do think a system that allows billionaires to exist when there are parts of alabama where people are still getting ringworm because they don ’ t have access to public health , is wrong .” <PARA> so although the turning point usa meme alluded to the fact that ocasio - cortez had provided context in her remarks , by including an ellipsis (...) in the middle of the quotation , the meme still deliberately left out that crucial context , and the net result of the quotation was to present a grossly misleading impression of what the congresswoman actually said . <PARA> ocasio - cortez was making a point about wealth inequality and economic injustice , rather than simply about wealth . she was articulating the view that the existence of vast personal wealth among a small number of people in the united states was morally insupportable if it coincided with dire poverty and depravation among a greater number of people — an age - old piece of progressive and left - wing orthodoxy . <PARA> in other words , it was not the existence of billionaires , as such , that the congresswoman said was “ wrong ” ( as the meme misleadingly suggested ), but the existence of billionaires under the socioeconomic conditions currently prevailing in the united states , some examples of which ocasio - cortez went on to list . <PARA> whether or not one agrees with the congresswoman ’ s viewpoint or analysis , that distinction — between what she said in its proper context and what the meme presented her as saying — was far from trivial . for that reason , we issue a rating of “ mostly false .”	
unproven	in late january 2019 , a meme that referenced a 2016 swedish crime story and contained some measure of unverified information circulated on social media : <PARA> what information is publicly available about this case holds that a 15 - year - old boy , identified as arminas pileckas , was allegedly stabbed by a 14 - year - old schoolmate around lunchtime in the small southern town of broby in the swedish county of skane on 11 january 2016 . the victim was taken to a hospital , where he died of his injuries . <PARA> the narrative shared in the meme reflects the talking points favored by anti - immigration partisans in both europe and the u . s . in regards to the tragedy . as the digital media outlet vocativ reported , “ anti - immigrant groups , websites and supporters are now seizing on the school stabbing story in sweden — and the rumors it ’ s inspired — as the latest tale of barbaric migrants run amok .” <PARA> for instance , the right - leaning swedish website fria tider reported that pileckas “ was stabbed to death by a student from the arab world after protecting a girl whom the killer had harassed .” in the u . s ., breitbart ran with a similar headline : “ 15 year old boy was stabbed to death by arab migrant because he was protecting young girl from sex assault .” <PARA> although such sites cast pileckas as a hero , criminal proceedings involving children aren ’ t public in sweden , so media reports about the motive for the killing are drawn from interviews given by the parents of both children and have not been verified by authorities . <PARA> nils karlsson , a member of the municipal council in the swedish city of malmö , said those with detailed knowledge about the case are prohibited from commenting on it publicly because of the young age of the offender . “ he was turned over to social services and they operate under very strict secrecy . so those who know more about the case are forbidden by law to talk about it . i highly doubt that fria tider has access to accurate information about any motives ,” karlsson told us . <PARA> both children were immigrants : pileckas ’ family is from lithuania , while the 14 - year - old suspect is from syria . as is customary in sweden , authorities don ’ t furnish personal information about suspects , particularly minors , and swedish legacy media outlets typically don ’ t publish it . discussion about motives initially surfaced on social media and reports from news outlets operating in the native languages of the suspect and victim . stockholm - based arabic language publication al kompis identified pileckas ’ killer as ahmed mustafa al - haj ali . <PARA> in interviews given to lithuanian - language news outlets , including lrytas . lt and the baltic publication delhi . lt , the murder victim ’ s father , žydrūnas pileckas , said his son was killed because he had defended a female student against harassment from ali . the swedish tabloid expressen did report an incident that involved the victim , the suspect , and other students in november 2015 that possibly led to the stabbing , but it didn ’ t go into detail about what happened . according to expressen , arminas pileckas reportedly “ protected a classmate against the 14 - year - old and urged [ that ] the classmate be left alone .” but expressen didn ’ t state that classmate ’ s gender or ethnicity and didn ’ t mention sexual harassment or assault . <PARA> ali ’ s father , mustafa al - hajj ali , told al kompis that pileckas had been bullying his son but adults at the school had failed to intervene . vocativ published a widely - shared video that purported to show pileckas slapping the suspect , then chasing him down a hallway , but the video didn ’ t show what led to the encounter . ali ’ s father told al kompis that the video was originally shared on the social media platform snapchat as part of a bullying campaign against his son . <PARA> the claim that pileckas was protecting a girl from sexual assault may have morphed out of various unconfirmed reports about the murder investigation alongside widespread but unfounded internet rumors labeling sweden the “ rape capital of europe ” — a claim pushed by anti - immigrant activists who exploited an influx of arabic - speaking refugees to sweden in 2015 for political purposes . but that claim is not corroborated by any official reports , and it ’ s unlikely that law enforcement in sweden would do so given the privacy laws applying minors there . <PARA> we have reached out to swedish police to see if they can verify any additional details of the case and are awaiting a response .	
false	as a devastating winter storm tore through chicago in late january 2019 , social media users , perhaps feeling concern , fell for a graphic that inflated the toll the storm took on the city . <PARA> the post , which originated on twitter on 27 january 2019 , read : <PARA> while the tweet was recirculated more than 13 , 000 times and highlighted ( or “ liked ”) more than 32 , 000 times , the accompanying photograph depicting a homeless person sleeping on a snowy street was actually taken on 22 january 2013 and featured in the canadian news outlet the national post . <PARA> the claim that 15 people were found frozen to death on the streets is also suspect . we contacted chicago police seeking more information , but as of the time of publication of our story only seven deaths in various states had been linked to the extreme cold front then sweeping through the midwestern u . s . <PARA> none of the reported victims was listed as homeless , although three people were found dead outdoors in michigan and iowa . the only fatality reported in chicago during the storm was an unidentified man hit by a snowplow . <PARA> the record - low temperatures in chicago , which reached - 23 ° f with a wind chill of - 52 ° f , caused the closure of a wide array of schools and other facilities and services across the city . <PARA> in response , city officials designated numerous police stations , libraries , religious centers , and other facilities as “ warming centers ” for anyone seeking shelter from the cold . <PARA> several local senior centers have also extended their operating hours in response to the weather , and the ride - sharing app lyft has offered to cover up to $ 25 of fares for rides to warming centers with use of the code “ chijayden19 .” that discount is available through 1 february 2019 .	
true	many social media users have grown weary of posts that simply seem too good to be true , ones that promise financial rewards to themselves or worthy causes in exchange for simple interactions such as liking or sharing posts . <PARA> this weariness comes with good reason : we ’ ve tracked countless of scams and hoaxes promising money ( or other rewards ) in exchange for tweets , likes , shares , or mentions . so when the hashtag # bellletstalk began to trend on twitter on the morning of 30 january 2019 , along with the promise that the telecommunications company bell canada would donate 5 cents for every tweet using the hashtag , it wasn ’ t surprising to see some social media users were skeptical of the fundraising effort . <PARA> one reader wrote to us to say : “ this is making its way around facebook . ‘ please send this to all ur friends $ 0 . 05 will be donated for every send . bell let ’ s talk .’ real or fake way to gather info ? thank you for your help .” <PARA> bell canada held their first “ bell let ’ s talk day ” in 2011 in an effort to raise both money and awareness for mental health issues . in general , on “ bell let ’ s talk day ” the company promises to donate 5 cents for various social media interactions , including tweeting with the hashtag # bellletstalk , viewing the official “ bell let ’ s talk ” video , or ( if you ’ re a bell wireless customer ) simply sending a text message : <PARA> here ’ s the official list of the ways that the public can help raise money and awareness for mental health with bell canada : <PARA> at the end of “ bell let ’ s talk day in 2018 ,” the company reported it had committed nearly $ 7 million to mental health initiatives . since the first event in 2011 , “ bell let ’ s talk day ” has generated more than 850 , 000 , 000 interactions and has triggered close to $ 100 million in donations : <PARA> according to the company , the funds generated during “ bell let ’ s talk day ” are used to provide grants to various projects and organizations that improve access to mental health care , such as the strongest families institute , bear clan patrol , and the st . stephen ’ s community house . <PARA> here ’ s the official video for “ bell let ’ s talk day ”:

false	several states legalized either recreational or medical marijuana use in 2018 , including vermont , michigan , utah , and missouri . those measures brought to 10 the number of states where cannabis use has been made legal for recreational purposes ( along with the district of columbia ), and 33 states now have full medicinal marijuana programs , according to the national conference of state legislatures . <PARA> in january 2019 , however , one viral social media meme sounded the alarm over the wave of cannabis liberalization seen in the united states in recent years , suggesting that those laws were being used a “ backdoor ” to stricter gun control : <PARA> it is true that individuals who buy or possess marijuana , even for medical purposes , and even in states where it is legal , could be prevented from legally buying or owning firearms . however , the circumstance is the result of a longstanding federal ban on marijuana , one which long predates state - by - state efforts to liberalize marijuana laws rather than being part of a conspiracy to use looser drug laws as a “ backdoor ” for firearm confiscation . <PARA> it is not the case most states that have legalized marijuana use have subsequently “ legislated that you lose your right to own a gun ” if you buy cannabis or have a prescription for it . rather , would - be gun - buyers are required , on penalty of felony prosecution , to disclose their marijuana use in forms they must submit to licensed gun sellers . <PARA> even if that drug use is legal in the state in question , licensed gun sellers are legally prohibited from selling firearms to a would - be buyer who also admits to using cannabis . <PARA> three pieces of federal law govern these issues . <PARA> first , under the controlled substances act of 1970 , marijuana and tetrahydrocannabinol ( thc , the psychoactive component in cannabis ) are schedule i controlled substances , which means that federal law regards them as having a “ high potential for abuse ” and “ no currently accepted medical use .” as a result , federal law prohibits the cultivation , sale , possession , purchase and use of such plants and products , regardless of what the laws of various states have to say on the matter . <PARA> ( in december 2018 , president donald trump signed the agriculture improvement act , which made it legal for license holders to grow and sell the cannabis plant hemp , but only when it has a thc content of 0 . 3 percent or less — that is , only for use as food or in the making of textiles , clothing , and so on .) <PARA> second , federal law also dictates that it is illegal for anyone who uses any controlled substance ( including marijuana and thc ) to buy or possess a firearm . title 18 , section 922 of the united states code states : <PARA> “( g ) it shall be unlawful for any person ...( 3 ) who is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance ( as defined in section 102 of the controlled substances act )... to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce , or possess in or affecting commerce , any firearm or ammunition ; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce .” <PARA> third , the same federal law also makes it illegal to sell or give a gun to anyone known or suspected to be a cannabis user . title 18 , section 922 of the u . s . code states : <PARA> “( d ) it shall be unlawful for any person to sell or otherwise dispose of any firearm or ammunition to any person knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that such person ...( 3 ) is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance ( as defined in section 102 of the controlled substances act ) ...” <PARA> title 18 section 922 also sets out legal requirements designed to enforce the ban on drug users possessing or buying guns , requiring licensed firearms dealers to perform background checks on would - be purchasers , and requiring would - be purchasers to submit a sworn statement of their legal eligibility to buy firearms . <PARA> the federal bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firearms and explosives ( atf ) has implemented the latter requirement as form 4473 , the “ firearms transaction record .” as part of that federally mandated process , anyone attempting buy a gun from a licensed seller must truthfully answer a series of yes / no questions , including : <PARA> “ 11 . e . are you an unlawful user of , or addicted to , marijuana or any depressant , stimulant , narcotic drug , or any other controlled substance ?” <PARA> the form includes two pieces of guidance about that question , making its potential legal ramifications clear . first , the question about drug use is accompanied by a disclaimer : “ warning : the use or possession of marijuana remains unlawful under federal law regardless of whether it has been legalized or decriminalized for medicinal or recreational purposes in the state where you reside .” <PARA> second , the applicant is required to affirm in writing : “ i understand that a person who answers ‘ yes ’ to any of the questions 11 . b . through 11 . i . ... is prohibited from purchasing or receiving a firearm .” <PARA> a marijuana user could , in theory , answer “ no ” to question 11 . e ., but that respondent would be violating federal law by doing so , as form 4473 warns : “ i also understand that making any false oral or written statement , or exhibiting any false or misrepresented identification with respect to this transaction , is a crime punishable as a felony under federal law , and may also violate state and / or local law .” <PARA> in 2011 , the atf issued guidelines for licensed firearms dealers , clarifying that they were forbidden by law from selling a gun to anyone who used marijuana , even if such use was legal in their state . furthermore , the atf & guidelines instructed licensed sellers that they could not sell to anyone with a medicinal marijuana card , even if that person answered “ no ” to question 11 . e ., and regardless of whether the would - be buyer was actually a marijuana user or had yet been prescribed marijuana for medicinal purposes . <PARA> “... if you are aware that the potential transferee is in possession of a card authorizing the possession and use of marijuana under state law , then you have ‘ reasonable cause to believe ’ that the person is an unlawful user of a controlled substance . as such , you may not transfer firearms or ammunition to the person , even if the person answered ‘ no ’ to question 11 . e . on atf form 4473 .” <PARA> in 2012 , a nevada woman named s . rowan wilson challenged those guidelines in federal court after a licensed gun dealer in the town of moundhouse refused to sell her a gun when she left question 11 . e . blank on her form 4473 due to her possession of a medicinal marijuana card . <PARA> the case made its way to the u . s . court of appeals for the ninth circuit , which in 2016 definitively ruled in favor of a u . s . district court that had dismissed wilson ’ s challenge , thereby upholding the federal ban on selling firearms even to medicinal marijuana users in states where medicinal marijuana use was legal . <PARA> it ’ s true that in recent years many states have legalized or decriminalized the use of marijuana for recreational or medicinal purposes . it ’ s also true that federal law , supported by administrative orders and court rulings , prohibits marijuana users from owning , possessing , or buying firearms , and prohibits anyone from selling or giving firearms to a person they know or suspect to be a drug user or even the owner of a medicinal marijuana card . <PARA> however , these two sets of facts came about separately . it is not the case that states have been legalizing cannabis use and subsequently legislating to bar cannabis users from owning guns as part of a “ backdoor ” plot to crack down on firearms possession , as a january 2019 meme claimed . <PARA> rather , individual states have been legalizing cannabis use against the background of a pre - existing and unchanging federal prohibition on controlled substances , including marijuana , and several federal laws which prohibit the possession or purchase of firearms by anyone who uses those controlled substances , including marijuana .	
unproven	on 9 january 2019 , a reddit user with the handle “ leblancelle76 ” took to that platform to report she had witnessed a serious crime . she alleged that a group of migrant men had kidnapped and gang raped a 13 - year - old girl from mexico and had taken her across the border into texas , where they held the reddit user ’ s husband at gunpoint until border patrol intervened in a helicopter . <PARA> we were unable to independently verify the user ’ s story . but the post has since gone viral , with many erroneously attributing it to a facebook user named lin myers ellis . the circulating message from “ leblancelle76 ” reads : <PARA> el indio is a tiny , unincorporated community in maverick county , southwest of san antonio . it has a population of less than 200 . as it falls within the jurisdiction of the maverick county sheriff ’ s department , we reached out sheriff tom schmerder to ask about the most serious and most specific claim in this post — that a mexican child had been gang raped , kidnapped and forced into texas by a group of armed migrant men . schmerber told us that if such a serious crime occurred , his deputies would have been notified . but he had no knowledge of the incident as reported . <PARA> we reached out to u . s . customs and border protection special operations supervisor david vera , who also told us he has no knowledge of the incident . <PARA> we checked with the law enforcement agency for the nearest city , eagle pass . humberto garza , spokesman for the eagle pass police department , told us that the department was not notified of any such incident . there are no local news reports about it , and mike ramos , a reporter for the local eagle pass news , told us he has not heard about it , either . <PARA> the post circulated amidst the longest federal government shutdown in u . s . history . the shutdown was spurred by an impasse between congressional democrats and president donald trump over trump ’ s demand that congress appropriate $ 5 . 7 billion in funding for border wall construction . <PARA> although the post has been widely attributed to ellis , ellis took to her facebook account on 12 january 2019 to state that she was simply reposting .

false	make up your mind , conspiracy theorists . is “ hot dog ” code for male prostitutes , or does “ hot dog ” simply refer to a food item ? <PARA> in january 2019 , president trump was criticized for serving items from mcdonald ’ s , burger king , and other fast food spots to the clemson tigers during a white house celebration of the football team ’ s ncaa championship . while a number of pundits defended trump , saying the controversy was overblown , the conspiracy theory website infowars went a step further and maintained that the criticism was hypocritical , claiming that former president barack obama had once purchased $ 65 , 000 worth of hot dogs for a private party : <PARA> “ the left is mocking president trump for providing a fast food buffet to a college football team , but emails obtained by wikileaks show that former president obama flew in $ 65 , 000 worth of hotdogs from chicago — using taxpayer funds — for a private party in 2009 .” <PARA> this argument was not made in good faith and was not based on any credible evidence . <PARA> the notion that president obama purchased $ 65 , 000 worth of hot dogs for a private party came from a single email chain published by wikileaks in october 2012 as part of the so - called “ global intelligence files .” this email was not sent by president obama or any member of his administration ; rather , the email chain , dated 14 may 2009 , involved various employees at the intelligence company stratfor discussing a “ chicago hot dog party .” <PARA> stratfor ’ s fred burton responded to an email by writing , “ i think obama spent about $ 65 , 000 of the tax - payers money flying in pizza / dogs from chicago for a private party at the white house not long ago , assume we are using the same channels ?” <PARA> this single message was not proof that president obama ever purchased $ 65 , 000 worth of hot dogs . it was merely speculation ( or possibly an attempt at humor ) about a supposed exorbitant expenditure by the obama administration . the email was not accompanied by any evidence to support its literal reading and did not originate with a member of the obama administration or from anyone in attendance at the alleged hot dog party . <PARA> it ’ s possible that the original stratfor email was misstating the facts about a super bowl viewing party hosted by president obama at the white house in february 2009 . the president did serve hot dogs at that party ( as well as brownies , hot fudge ice cream , pizza , soft pretzels , chicken sandwiches , etc .), but we found no reports stating that he purchased $ 65 , 000 worth of hot dogs ( at $ 3 a dog , that ’ s more than 20 , 000 hot dogs ) or that the treats were flown in from chicago . <PARA> interestingly , this isn ’ t the first time this “ hot dog ” email has been used in an attempt to smear the obama administration . back in 2016 , this innocuous email exchange was used to push the pizzagate conspiracy theory . infowars head alex jones himself even claimed that “ hot dog ” was actually code for “ male prostitutes ”: <PARA> while jones once used the term “ hot dog ” to push a baseless conspiracy theory concerning pedophilia and sex trafficking , by january 2019 this code word for male prostitutes had reverted back to referencing an ordinary food item in order to launch a new ( yet similarly baseless ) attack on obama . <PARA> we reached out to pete souza , obama ’ s official white house photographer , to determine if he had ever seen his former boss with a suspiciously large amount of hot dogs . he told us , “ i shot almost two million photographs as the chief official white house photographer during my eight years in the obama administration . every picture was transferred to the national archives on 1 / 20 / 2017 , and i can assure you there is not a single photograph of president obama with 20 , 000 hot dogs .”	
false	during the u . s . federal government shutdown that began in december 2018 , president donald trump and many of his supporters blamed congressional democrats for the budgetary impasse . <PARA> as part of that rhetorical battle , trump and others accused democrats of hypocrisy and political opportunism , alleging that their current opposition to providing funding for the president ’ s long - promised border wall was in stark contrast to their past support for border security infrastructure . <PARA> in his 8 january 2019 oval office address , president trump alluded to this notion by taking a swipe at chuck schumer , the democratic senate minority leader who , along with house speaker nancy pelosi , was scheduled to offer a response to the president ’ s primetime immigration speech : <PARA> “ senator chuck schumer — who you will be hearing from later tonight — has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past , along with many other democrats . they changed their mind only after i was elected president .” <PARA> “ schumer , pelosi and the dems may have wished they had just given potus the 5 billion for the wall ... rather than having to answer this question !!! ... or is this the bigger picture ??? where is the $ 50 billion set aside for the 2006 secure fence act ? bush signed it & obama was supposed to oversee its construction ? where is the money ?” <PARA> the figure of $ 50 billion was especially significant because it was a far greater sum than the $ 5 billion for border wall construction which president trump demanded be included in the 2019 federal budget , and which formed the crux of the partisan standoff and ensuing government shutdown . <PARA> the “$ 50 billion ” message was shared widely on twitter and facebook , prompting inquiries from readers about its veracity . <PARA> in reality , $ 50 billion was not set aside for border security infrastructure as part of the 2006 secure fence act , and therefore no misappropriation of such funding occurred . <PARA> one analysis , which predated the secure fence act by seven years , predicted that building and maintaining the type of border fencing provided for in that legislation might cost up to $ 49 billion over the course of 25 years , but that analysis did not play a significant role in congressional deliberations before the passing of the secure fence act . <PARA> the secure fence act was a law introduced by republican congressman peter king of new york in september 2006 and signed by president george w . bush on 26 october 2006 . among other provisions , the law required the secretary of homeland security to begin ( within 18 months ) the construction of at least two layers of fencing , along with barriers , cameras , and sensors , along five sections of the united states border with mexico : <PARA> in the context of the 2018 - 19 controversy over president trump ’ s proposed border wall , republicans made claims about the effectiveness of that border fencing in reducing illegal border crossings into the united states . in a previous fact check , we found such claims to be vague and flawed . <PARA> some democrats supported the bill , and some didn ’ t . in the house of representatives , the secure fence act passed by 283 votes to 138 , with 64 democrats voting in favor and 131 , including nancy pelosi , voting against it . <PARA> in the u . s . senate , the bill passed 80 - 19 . some 26 democrats supported it , including future president and vice - president barack obama and joe biden , 2016 presidential nominee hillary clinton , and future senate minority leader chuck schumer , while 17 democrats , including future secretary of state john kerry and future senate majority leader harry reid , opposed it . <PARA> the claim that congress “ set aside ” $ 50 billion for border fencing in 2006 appears to have been derived from a 1999 study conducted by the u . s . army corps of engineers . <PARA> in a 2 january 2019 & column for fox news , republican u . s . representative steve scalise of louisiana used the figure in accusing congressional democrats of “ playing games with america ’ s safety ”: <PARA> in a 2017 boston globe column , annie linskey wrote of the secure fence act that “ congress put aside $ 1 . 4 billion for the fence , but the whole cost , including maintenance , was pegged at $ 50 billion over 25 years , according to analyses at the time .” <PARA> several articles from early 2007 and 2008 referred to the $ 50 billion claim . for example , in september 2008 , then - democratic u . s . representative silvestre reyes of texas wrote in opposition to the border fencing envisioned in the secure fence act : <PARA> “ with construction expected to exceed $ 1 . 2 billion and lifetime maintenance of up to $ 50 billion , the exorbitant cost of this border fence would be better invested in additional border patrol agents , equipment and technology .” <PARA> in january 2007 , the migration policy institute cited a report by the congressional research service as its source for the $ 50 billion figure , writing : <PARA> the crs report was dated 21 september 2006 : seven days after the house of representatives passed the secure fence act , and eight days before the senate did likewise : <PARA> the double - layer fencing envisioned in the secure fence act was expected to stretch for a total of around 700 miles . if the “ 25 - year life cycle cost ” of the fence was between $ 16 . 4 million and $ 70 million per mile , that would equate to a 25 - year cost of between $ 11 . 5 billion and $ 49 billion . <PARA> that “ worst case ” estimate of $ 49 billion over 25 years is the source of the “$ 50 billion ” claim which was promulgated in 2007 and 2008 , and then again in 2017 and 2019 , amid the controversy over president trump ’ s border wall proposals , and democratic opposition to them . <PARA> because the original corps of engineers study was seven years old by 2006 , the crs adjusted the original figures presented in the 1999 report for inflation . the corps of engineers recommended using landing mat fencing for a primary fence and sandia fencing for a secondary fence . those figures were as follows : <PARA> the existence of the 1999 corps of engineers study shows that , at the time lawmakers voted through the secure fence act in 2006 , one analysis from a reliable source included estimates that indicated the 25 - year cost of a 700 - mile double - layer fence along the southern border ( such as that envisioned in the secure fence act ) could range from $ 11 . 5 billion to $ 49 billion . <PARA> furthermore , a congressional research service report which reiterated those findings was published on 21 september 2006 , too late to be taken into consideration by u . s . representatives , but before their senate counterparts cast their votes . <PARA> however , these estimates ( the source of the “$ 50 billion ” figure ) only appear to have attracted attention and gained traction after the passing of the secure fence act ( for example in the january 2007 migration policy institute analysis ), rather than beforehand . <PARA> in a debate about the bill on 29 september 2006 , for example , several u . s . senators offered varying estimates of the likely cost of the fencing envisioned in the secure fence act . none of them mentioned a figure of $ 50 billion , or even close to that . <PARA> in fact , no member of either house of congress mentioned either the figure of $ 50 billion nor the original 1999 army corps of engineers study during any debate about the secure fence act . <PARA> on 25 september 2006 , the washington post reported that confusion existed over how much the construction of the fencing would cost , although again , none of the estimates listed in the article came anywhere close to $ 50 billion : <PARA> so while it ’ s true that the army corps of engineers study was publicly available when congress passed the secure fence act in 2006 and could have proved instructive to the debate around the planned construction of border fencing , no evidence suggests that either document played a part in the considerations or deliberations of lawmakers before they cast their votes . <PARA> this is worth bearing in mind when evaluating any claim that lawmakers ( particularly democrats now hostile to president trump ’ s border wall plans ) passed the secure fence act despite estimates which placed its 25 - year cost at $ 50 billion . <PARA> finally , the more specific claim made in the meme and by rep . scalise , that the secure fence act “ allocated ” or “ set aside ” $ 50 billion over 25 years , is false . in fact , the secure fence act did not authorize , allocate or “ set aside ” any funding . <PARA> in 2017 , the government accountability office ( gao ) reported that the u . s . customs and border protection agency ( cbp ) had spent $ 2 . 3 billion on building 654 miles of border fencing between 2007 and 2015 , and that cbp had projected in 2009 that the cost of maintaining its border fencing for 20 years would be $ 1 billion .

false	on 30 december 2018 , news punch , a junk news website with a long history of spreading misinformation , published an article reporting that 10 , 800 american children had been raped by illegal immigrants during 2018 : “ the number of u . s . children raped by illegal immigrants in 2018 was a staggering 10 , 800 , according to data compiled by ncfire ( north carolinians for immigration reform and enforcement ).” <PARA> this claim has multiple dubious aspects , starting with the ncfire data . <PARA> ncfire purports to compile “ monthly child rape reports ” covering sexual assaults committed by illegal immigrants in north carolina . our inspection of their data , however , turned up a number of issues . for starters , while the data were compiled under the title “ monthly child rape reports ,” the supporting documents actually included a variety of sex - related crimes , such as possession of child pornography and “ indecent liberties with a child ,” that aren ’ t rape . we also found one individual who was included in the 2018 report even though he raped a child in 2011 . that person presumably was included in the 2018 report because of an arrest that year for failing to report an address change . <PARA> in addition to including outdated charges and crimes other than rape in the “ monthly child rape reports ,” ncfire also appears to be counting arrests , not convictions . in other words , a number of individuals included in these reports have only been accused of crimes , and the charges against them may be dropped or found to be unsupported at trial . <PARA> furthermore , while some entries on this list link to genuine reports from ice ( u . s . immigration and customs enforcement ), the majority of entries include links to news reports or mugshot pages that make no mention of immigration status . although this group claims that they “ verify the illegal alien status of each individual we post in our monthly child rape reports through the arresting agency of each individual ,” a spokesperson for the raleigh police department told us that they “ were not familiar ” with ncfire . <PARA> despite the multiple problems with the rape reporting , news punch used these statistics to come up with their 10 , 800 figure : <PARA> the claim that 10 , 800 children in the u . s . were raped by illegal immigrants did not originate with a law enforcement agency , government body , or other reputable crime - tracking source . rather , an average figure pulled from questionable data compiled by one group in one state was extrapolated to the entirety of the u . s . without basis . <PARA> that number also doesn ’ t square with what we know about the criminal activities of illegal immigrants or the statistics for sexual abuse against children . although the 2018 ice enforcement and removal operations report does not specifically list crimes against children , it does shed some light on the number of sexual crimes committed by illegal immigrants . according to the ice report , 5 , 350 charges or convictions of sexual assault were levied against illegal immigrants during the 2018 fiscal year . another 6 , 888 charges or convictions relating to sexual offenses ( not involving assault ) were also recorded : <PARA> the claim that 10 , 800 american children were raped by illegal immigrants in 2018 is also implausible due to the fact that the vast majority of sexual crimes against children are committed by parents or relatives , as the rape , abuse & incest national network ( rainn ) reported in 2016 : <PARA> out of the yearly 63 , 000 sexual abuse cases substantiated , or found [ by ] strong evidence , by child protective services ( cps ), the perpetrator was most often the parent :

false	on 26 december 2018 , president trump and first lady melania trump made a surprise visit to al asad air base in iraq for a christmastime meeting with military members who were stationed in the war zone there . shortly thereafter , a claim began circulating on social media that melania trump was the first first lady to undertake such a trip : <PARA> the definition of what constitutes a ‘ war zone ’ or a ‘ combat zone ’ is somewhat subjective and therefore variable . although these terms may invoke images of areas under immediate threat of military attack , we found no record of any first lady ’ s traveling to or remaining in an area where armed hostilities were actively taking place . these terms are often used to refer to the general areas in which a war is being fought and do not necessarily have strict or well - defined boundaries , as encapsulated in the irs ’ definition of such : <PARA> that said , by the standards of contemporaneous reporting , melania trump was not the first first lady to make such a trip . although our list may not be comprehensive , we found that first ladies eleanor roosevelt , pat nixon , barbara bush , hillary clinton , and laura bush were all reported during their tenures as having ventured into “ war zones ” and other potentially dangerous territories as they visited troops stationed overseas . <PARA> eleanor roosevelt , for example , made several trips to war zones during world war ii in the 1940s : <PARA> first lady pat nixon was also described as having taken part in a “ dangerous visit ” to “ an active combat zone ” in vietnam in 1969 : <PARA> since 1969 , barbara bush , hillary clinton , and laura bush have all traveled to military bases overseas to meet with u . s . troops . first lady barbara bush visited saudi arabia over thanksgiving in 1990 , in the midst of operation desert shield ( the build - up of troops and the defenses of saudi arabia at the beginning of the gulf war ): <PARA> while hillary clinton was first lady , she traveled to bosnia in 1996 . although active hostilities in bosnia had ended a few months prior to her visit , officials still considered the area a “ potential ” combat zone : <PARA> although clinton ’ s trip to bosnia may have scored her political points during her time as first lady , that visit would later become a subject of controversy and criticism . during the 2008 presidential campaign clinton was accused of exaggerating the dangers of her bosnia visit for saying she had been “ under sniper fire ” when she landed at the tuzla air base . <PARA> ( it should be noted that when hillary clinton ’ s trip to bosnia in 1996 was touted as “ the first time since roosevelt that a first lady has voyaged to a potential combat zone ,” that claim was similarly debunked .) <PARA> laura bush also visited troops overseas during her time as first lady , paying a brief visit to afghanistan in 2005 :	
true	photographs of various fruits accompanied by long lists of chemicals crafted in the style of ingredients labels have been a fixture on the internet since at least 2013 , when they were created by james kennedy , a high school chemistry teacher in melbourne , australia . his take on the banana is especially popular : <PARA> this graphic is an accurate representation of the chemical constituents of your average banana , information that can be verified with the usda agricultural research database , which compiles studies into the nutritional and chemical content of various food items . <PARA> part of what kennedy was trying to convey with his illustration was that even completely natural foods , when described scientifically , can sound unnatural and potentially unhealthy , as reported in the new york times : <PARA> if these ingredients are considered hierarchically , the banana sounds much more simple . like all fruit , it contains water , sugars , starch , fiber , amino acids , fatty acids , minerals ( i . e ., ash ), and chemicals that impart their coloring . myriad names can be ascribed to the various different chemicals that fit these groups , and kennedy used a variety of different nomenclatural methods to make that point . <PARA> the most common grouping of chemicals in the banana are sugars , and in this case the sugars are predominantly glucose and fructose , with lesser amounts of sucrose and maltose . after starch , a polysaccharide chemical found in abundance in plants , the next listed set of chemicals is fiber , another common group of carbohydrate chemicals . <PARA> kennedy represented the fiber as a group of chemicals listed by their “ e numbers ”, which are codes assigned to substances permitted as food additives within the european union . in reality , all of these chemicals are either cellulose ( the most common chemical in plants ) or various breakdown products of cellulose : <PARA> after the fiber , kennedy listed amino acids , a group of simple chemicals ubiquitous to life on this planet . all the chemicals listed are present in bananas , according to the usda . fatty acids , the next group of chemicals , are similarly ubiquitous in nature , and all of those chemicals listed above are also found in bananas . likewise , ash is another way of referring to the mineral content of a food item , and in this case kennedy used a variety of different chemical - naming conventions to obscure the fact that each of them is commonly known by other names : <PARA> similarly , the coloring agents — all of which are natural — might be better recognized by different names : <PARA> the remaining chemicals may sound intimidating , but they too are natural . e1510 is another name for ethanol , which forms naturally as fruit ferments . the final “ natural ripening agent ,” ethylene gas , might sound downright nefarious but actually represents a neat intersection of plant and food science . in nature , the gas is a plant hormone associated with aging that triggers the ripening process . in the food industry , the gas is used on industrial scales to ripen a variety of fruits and vegetables all at once . <PARA> in sum , this graphic accurately depicts the chemicals that comprise a banana , using a variety of tactics to make that completely natural food appear to be full of “ chemicals ” — something originally created by a high school chemistry teacher as part of a lesson on chemophobia .

false	the final weeks of every year see the “ war on christmas ” return to television panel debates and newspaper columns in the united states , bringing ( dubious ) claims that modern american society has progressively marginalized and turned against public expressions of christianity . <PARA> in december 2018 , one widely - shared internet meme turned this annual trope on its head , claiming that christmas only came to be accepted relatively late on in the history of the united states , after a long period of puritan disdain for what was once perceived as a “ pagan holiday .” <PARA> the facebook page “ for truth not religion ” posted a meme featuring blurred images of “ publick notices ” describing christmas traditions as “ satanical practices ,” along with the claim that “ christmas was illegal in the u . s . until 1836 as it was considered an ancient pagan holiday ”: <PARA> at one time , in both american and english history , christmas was indeed regarded as a pagan holiday , but it ’ s not true to say that the festival was banned in the united states until 1836 . <PARA> neither the meme itself nor “ for truth not religion ” cited any sources , but the two archaic notices shown in the meme provided some clue as to the origins of the claim . <PARA> the first was a law passed by the general court in the massachusetts bay colony in 1659 , which read as follows : <PARA> the second notice read as follows : <PARA> the first notice came from a statute passed in the massachusetts bay colony in 1659 , which can be viewed here . the provenance of the second notice is unclear : the earliest instance of it we could find was a 1963 newspaper article that referred to the atlantic monthly magazine ’ s having republished it as part of a subscription renewal advertisement , describing the notice as a 1660 massachusetts law . despite this citation , it is not included in various online collections of massachusetts colonial records , which , by contrast , do contain the first notice . <PARA> it ’ s possible that the second notice did originate in massachusetts in 1660 but was a public advertisement that summarized and reiterated the 1659 law , rather than being a discrete statute of its own . <PARA> in any event , it is true that the celebration of christmas was indeed banned in colonial massachusetts in 1659 . that ban was motivated largely by the austere puritan religious beliefs of authorities in the colony , who objected to the december 25th celebration for two main reasons : because it was originally a pagan winter festival co - opted by christians and lacking in any biblical basis , and because it was typically accompanied by merriment and indulgence and therefore was anathema to the puritan principles of sobriety and hard work . <PARA> in his book the battle for christmas the historian stephen nissenbaum referenced the suppression of christmas celebrations in early new england : <PARA> nissenbaum noted that the puritans often pointed out the lack of explicit biblical support for december 25 as jesus ’ birthday ( an issue we have separately examined in greater depth ) and emphasized its pagan origins as well as decrying the excess that often came with it : <PARA> the puritan crackdown on christmas in massachusetts had a recent precedent in english history . during the 1640s and 1650s , under the influence of oliver cromwell , england ’ s short - lived republican parliament passed laws restricting and prohibiting the celebration of christmas . <PARA> first in 1644 , lawmakers passed an ordinance which called for december 25 to be a day of “ solemn humiliation ” rather than the “ carnal and sensual delights ” which had characterized the celebration of christmas : <PARA> in 1647 , the english parliament banned the celebration of christmas altogether , along with easter and whit sunday , replacing them with a monthly day of rest : <PARA> however , these crackdowns did not last long . when the english monarchy resumed under charles ii in 1660 ( ushering in a period known as the restoration ), laws passed during the preceding 18 years were struck down , and christmas has been legally and enthusiastically celebrated there ever since . <PARA> similarly , the massachusetts bay prohibition on christmas was repealed in 1681 , some 22 years after it was introduced . we were unable to find any record of a similar ban on the celebration of christmas after that date , either in the north - eastern colonies of the 17th and 18th centuries , or anywhere throughout the united states after 1776 . <PARA> indeed , the emphasis on religious liberty in the 1791 bill of rights , whose first amendment famously bars states from creating any law “ prohibiting the free exercise ” of religion , means any attempt to outlaw the celebration of christmas would have been given short shrift . <PARA> the significance of 1836 appears to be as the year in which , it is widely held , alabama became the first u . s . state to formally recognize christmas day as a public holiday . however , some dispute exists over this date . the earliest record we could find placing alabama ’ s legal recognition of christmas at 1836 was james harwood barnett ’ s 1954 book the american christmas . <PARA> however , despite searching news archives and alabama legislative records , we were unable to verify that the state passed any statute or resolution in 1836 rendering christmas day a public holiday . in any event , the claim in the meme that christmas was “ illegal in the u . s . until 1836 ” is wrong in several ways . <PARA> first , christmas was only ever illegal from 1659 until 1681 , and not thereafter . secondly , that ban was limited to the massachusetts bay colony and never took hold throughout the united states , which was not even formed until almost a century after the massachusetts ban had ended . finally , 1836 was the year in which , according to some sources , the first u . s . state recognized christmas day as a public holiday . however , there is reason to doubt the accuracy of that date , and in any case , the series of laws passed throughout the united states in the 19th century had the effect of making december 25 a day off for laborers , not overturning a ban on christmas day . <PARA> for these reasons , the claim contained in the “ for truth not religion ” meme is false .	
false	in 2009 , biologist judy mikovits , who was then the research director of the chronic fatigue syndrome - focused whittemore peterson institute ( wpi ), published a paper on what she and many others thought to be a major scientific breakthrough in the prestigious journal science . her team alleged to have demonstrated an association between a newly discovered retrovirus called “ xenotropic murine leukemia virus - related virus ” ( xmrv ) and the poorly understood condition known as chronic fatigue syndrome ( cfs ), suggesting a potential viral cause for cfs . <PARA> the paper received substantial international coverage . however , as with so many other potentially groundbreaking studies , nobody — including many of the same researchers involved with the original study — was able to replicate its results . numerous attempts failed to replicate the study , and the research itself came under increasing scrutiny for sloppy methods and its reliance on misleading or manufactured figures . <PARA> on 1 july 2011 , science ’ s editors issued a “ statement of concern ” about the paper . on 14 october 2011 , the authors issued a partial retraction of their paper that touched on issues with some of their figures . finally , on 23 december 2011 , the editors of science retracted the paper in full : <PARA> three months later , the whittemore peterson institute fired judy mikovits amid concerns over the integrity of her work and her collaboration with an outside scientist , as reported in the multidisciplinary scientific journal nature : <PARA> a few months after that , mikovits was arrested in southern california “ on an ‘ out of county warrant ’ from washoe county , nevada , for allegedly taking lab notebooks , a computer , and other material from the whittemore peterson institute in reno , nevada , after the wpi fired her .” the arrest came in conjunction with a lawsuit from wpi that sought a restraining order to block mikovits ’ destruction of data which they maintained belonged to the institute : <PARA> the charges were dropped , not because of the merits of the case , but due to a variety of complicating legal factors related to the family that runs the whittemore peterson institute : <PARA> fast forwarding to 2018 , we find that mikovits has become lionized by the medical conspiracy community , appearing on unreliable websites such as natural news and giving talks at fringe conferences such as the truth about cancer and autism one , with her claims echoing through the various clickbait factories that regurgitate wholesale content from these dubious organizations . for example , the website “ real farmacy ” described mikovits ’ saga as follows in a 28 november 2018 post : <PARA> astute readers may note that the 2009 paper discussed above did not concern vaccines . mikovits , following the publication of her since - retracted paper , made a series of unsupported claims that xmrv was the cause of myriad other medical maladies , including autism and cancer , and that xmrv in humans could have its origins in mouse cells used in the vaccine production process — a notion that has been exhaustively discredited . <PARA> much of the material mikovits used to make her point was also retracted , including a 2006 paper that alleged to show xmrv was present in human prostate cancer cells but actually produced erroneous results due to laboratory contamination . <PARA> an exhaustive body of work , which includes some of the same researchers involved in the original 2009 paper , has discredited any link between xmrv and disease . “ the bottom line is we found no evidence of infection with xmrv ... these results refute any correlation between these agents and disease ,” said co - author ian lipkin of columbia university in a press release . <PARA> to suggest that mikovits ’ arrest stemmed from a perceived threat to the vaccine industry or “ the deep state ” and not her alleged refusal to return scientific data and equipment to the institute that fired her requires completely ignoring this large body of scientific work while solely relying on the narrative presented by mikovits in her 2014 book , plague : one scientist ’ s intrepid search for the truth about human retroviruses and chronic fatigue syndrome ( me / cfs ), autism , and other diseases . <PARA> in the introduction to that work , which entirely ignored her firing from whittemore , mikovits alleged that the federal government had threatened to arrest her if she set foot on national institutes of health property to participate in the study that attempted to validate her previous work : <PARA> dr . frank rusetti is a long - time collaborator of mikovits ’. we reached out to dr . tony fauci , the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious disease at the national institute of health , about the existence of the email in which he allegedly threatened mikovits with arrest , and he told us ( via email ): <PARA> we also reached out to both rusetti and mikovits via their consulting website for more information about this alleged email but have not received a response . <PARA> since 2016 , science has reached the consensus view that the xmrv detected in these various studies was a laboratory contaminant which affected the research cell lines used by the scientists conducting those studies , and that it was not a virus that had been transmitted to humans in any way . in a video produced by the conspiracy website natural news in 2018 , however , mikovits made a series of additional claims that she had been fired and jailed for exposing that millions of americans had supposedly been infected with viruses “ that came from out of labs into humans via contaminated blood and vaccines ”: <PARA> as noted above , mikovits ’ controversial paper did not demonstrate that xmrv “ came out of the lab into humans via contaminated blood and vaccines ”; rather , it speculated such after seemingly demonstrating a ( now discredited ) association between xmrv and cfs . to say mikovits was jailed for exposing widespread virus transmission via vaccines or blood transfusions is false , not only because she was actually jailed for allegedly stealing property , but also because she never scientifically demonstrated the claim she suggests the government wanted to silence her over . in her interview with natural news , mikovits stated that the idea for the connection between viruses and vaccines came from another researcher in a paper published in 2011 : <PARA> that paper , which referenced two other now - retracted papers in its abstract , only presented the vaccine scenario speculatively as a potential route for humans to acquire xmrv : <PARA> that study did conclude by opining that the “ most likely mode of xmrv transmission points to mouse - derived biological products ” and stating that the authors hoped the study would “ spur further discussion and help to resolve the many remaining xmrv questions .” but in a paper published just five months later titled “ xmrv : not a mousy virus ”, those same authors walked back claims of xmrv ’ s prevalence ( and even its existence as a true human virus ) based on results which called earlier laboratory methods into question : <PARA> further research determined that all xmrv samples detected in these studies stemmed from a contaminated cell line affecting all the labs performing these studies , that it did not cause disease , and that it did not enter the population via vaccines or blood transfusions : <PARA> therefore , mikovits ’ speculative claims linking her research to vaccine science , drawing the ire of “ big pharma ” and the “ deep state ”, and her subsequent arrest are not rooted in science or reality . but although she may have lost the support of the scientific community , she appears to have found a new home in the pseudoscientific conspiracy world . <PARA> “ in the united states of america ... everything ’ s censored ,” mikovits said on the website of a man who guest hosts alex jones ’ infowars conspiracy ranting , “ so to look at things like natural news , to come to meetings like the truth about cancer , i was just floored today because today was the first time i was treated like a human being who had knowledge for a very long time .”

false	in the summer of 2018 , a viral facebook meme compared a pennsylvania college with nazis in referring to an 18 - month - old controversy over puzzle piece pins and the concept of white privilege . <PARA> on 26 july , edward miles sr . posted a meme which included a 1945 photograph taken by evgenii khaldeii showing a jewish man and woman wearing the star of david in nazi - occupied budapest , along with the message “ elizabeth town [ sic ] college democrats want white students to wear white privilege pins wherever they go this month . remind me one more time who is acting like nazis again ?” <PARA> the meme referred to a real controversy from february 2017 at elizabethtown college , a small private university in lancaster county , pennsylvania . however , the meme grossly misrepresented both the nature of the “ white privilege ” campaign at the college , as well as the holocaust - era policy of forcing jewish people to wear the star of david insignia . <PARA> on 11 february 2017 , the college democrats at elizabethtown college launched a campaign to encourage students and faculty to wear white puzzle piece pins to represent white privilege , as part of a campaign to raise awareness and stimulate debate around racial tensions . <PARA> the group ’ s president , aileen ida , told the lancaster online news website that “ this project will encourage people to have conversations about race and how their inherent white privilege has a part in the systematic oppression of minorities — whether or not they purposefully participate in the system .” <PARA> according to the college democrats , the “ personal identity campaign ” was inspired by barb girod , a lutheran pastor in wisconsin , who undertook a similar effort to wear a symbolic white pin every day for a month in order to remind herself of her own privilege : <PARA> in an interview with the college fix , ida clarified that the pins were not intended to be worn by only white students , but rather to stimulate a general conversation about race and racial justice . <PARA> the campaign garnered local , national and international media attention and was met with some criticism , particularly from conservatives . fox news contributor lisa boothe said the initiative would exacerbate racial divisions , and in the same panel discussion , fellow contributor rachel campos - duffy claimed it was intended to cause “ self - loathing ” among white students . <PARA> fox news host jesse watters visited the campus of elizabethtown college , conducting a segment that mocked and dismissed the campaign as well as the concept of white privilege itself . writing in the conservative national review , katherine timpf argued that the campaign was designed to give participants the appearance of activism but would be ineffective in actually changing minds or prompting sincere debate . <PARA> university authorities stood by the right of the college democrats to launch their initiative and emphasized in a statement that participation was entirely optional : <PARA> the facebook meme was therefore accurate in its claim that “ elizabethtown college democrats want white students to wear white privilege pins ,” but wildly off the mark in comparing the february 2017 campaign with the nazi policy of forcing jewish people during the holocaust to wear the star of david in order to be easily identified as jews . <PARA> participation in the elizabethtown campaign was entirely voluntary , was not limited to only white students , lasted for just one month , and was intended to prompt civilized debate and self - reflection in the safe context of an establishment of higher education , especially on the part of white students , who constitute a significant majority at elizabethtown college and in surrounding areas . <PARA> by contrast , the nazi policy was enforced on pain of violence and death and was part of military - backed dictatorship ’ s wider effort of segregating , deporting , and eliminating an historically oppressed and vilified minority group in germany and other nazi - occupied areas of europe . <PARA> it should be glaringly obvious to any observer that the two campaigns defy even the most tenuous comparison .	
true	just three years shy of the 400th anniversary of the legendarily peaceful meal shared by members of the mashtree wampanoag tribe with newly - arrived pilgrims in an event that has since been commemorated as thanksgiving , descendants of those same native americans protested in the u . s . capital against a variation on a sad historical theme . <PARA> after being promised that 321 acres of their ancestral land would be preserved in trust , the tribe saw their hopes dashed when the trump administration reversed course from its predecessor . <PARA> the mashpee wampanoag tribe is currently suing the federal government because the department of the interior ( doi ) on 7 september 2018 reversed an obama - era decision to put 321 acres of land in trust on behalf of the tribe . although the final outcome rests on a court ’ s interpretation of whether the tribe was under “ federal jurisdiction ” according to a 1934 law , the land is viewed by the indigenous community as their means to future self - determination . <PARA> thus , as many americans planned for a thanksgiving feast , tribe members and their supporters marched on the u . s . capitol protesting the decision , which they say could cost them lands the tribe has lived on for 12 , 000 years . <PARA> in an op - ed for the boston globe explaining the community ’ s plight , tribal council vice chairwoman jessie little doe baird wrote : <PARA> according to court documents , the situation stemmed from a years - long battle in which the tribe “ sought to address its landlessness ” and petitioned the doi “ to acquire in trust approximately 170 acres of land in mashpee , massachusetts , and approximately 150 acres near taunton , massachusetts .” <PARA> the tribal community planned to use the land for “ self - determination and self - governance ” as well as housing , education , and cultural preservation . they also wanted to ensure the preservation of an ancestral burial ground and develop land in taunton for an indian gaming facility “ with revenues intended to support the mashpee tribal government and meet the needs of tribal members ,” court documents stated . <PARA> mashpee wampanoag members received happy news on 18 september 2015 when they were informed the federal government would acquire 151 acres in taunton and 170 in mashpee and hold the land in trust for the tribe . but some east taunton residents filed suit over the issue in 2016 , and a federal court sided with the residents against the tribe , holding that the interior department did not have the authority to take land in trust for the tribe in the manner they did . <PARA> both parties appealed that decision , but in 2017 the u . s . justice department dropped their participation in the appeal , leaving the mashpee wampanoag to contest the issue on their own . then on 7 september 2018 , the doi issued a decision that reversed their previous one , finding that the mashpee wampanoag were not eligible to have land held in federal trust for them because they didn ’ t meet the criterion of having been considered “ under federal jurisdiction ” in 1934 , the year the indian reorganization act ( ira ) was passed , a status paramount to a tribe ’ s receiving land in trust . <PARA> the tribe then asked the court for a stay of their original appeal of the taunton plaintiffs ’ lawsuit while they pursued a separate lawsuit against the doi to compel that agency to set aside their decision declaring the tribe ineligible to be granted land in trust . <PARA> “ in its decision , the department failed to apply established law , contorting some of the relevant facts and ignoring others to engineer a negative decision ,” the tribe ’ s lawsuit states . “ as a result the department ’ s decision is arbitrary , capricious and contrary to law , and if left unaddressed , will have a devastating impact on the tribe .” <PARA> interior department officials ultimately determined that the tribe was not under federal jurisdiction in 1934 , while the mashpee wampanoag contend they submitted “ mounds of evidence ” documenting that they were indeed under federal jurisdiction before 1934 . on 20 november 2018 , the doi asked the court for a 31 - day extension on a deadline to respond to the tribe ’ s lawsuit <PARA> even if the mashpee wampanoag were to prevail in their lawsuit against the doi , they would still have to succeed in their appeal of the taunton lawsuit holding that the land was improperly acquired by the interior department in the first place . on 9 october 2018 , the plantiffs ’ attorney filed a request arguing that the tribe should not be granted another stay in the appeal process . <PARA> in her op - ed , baird noted that although her ancestors shared a peaceful meal with pilgrims , the story often told about the original thanksgiving leaves out a less heartwarming aspect of american history :	
false	as television host john oliver wisely illustrated with “ definitelyrealquotes . com ”, it is extremely easy to convincingly attribute any saying to any historical figure by presenting the words in the form of a meme and without any citation or documentation . that approach seems to be the employed for a well - shared but attribution - free quotation about muslims and minority rights alleged to have come from pen of british political figure winston churchill : <PARA> although such a statement might not have been out of character for churchill , whose controversial musings on islam revealed both a fascination and fear of the faith , no evidence documents his having said or written any such thing . <PARA> richard langworth , a senior fellow with the hillsdale college winston churchill project , included this putative churchillian quote in a 16 november 2018 addition to his running list of “ all the ‘ quotes ’ winston churchill never said .” <PARA> as best we can tell , this “ quote ” is an utterance commonly found in the comment sections of islamophobic websites and was later attributed to churchill with the use of photoshop . for example , on 11 may 2015 , a man commented on a blog named “ the muslim issue ” with the words allegedly uttered by churchill : <PARA> similarly , a 5 december 2015 islamophobic message board post from someone named “ grampa dave ” used the same statement ( without attribution to churchill ) as a sign - off . and a scantily worded and lightly proofread 27 january 2017 letter to the editor written by a man named don searles and printed by the illinois newspaper journal gazette / times - courier used the same statement and followed up with a call for people to prove him wrong : <PARA> not only were these words not first attributed to winston churchill until well into the 21st century , but they don ’ t seem to have appeared in print anywhere at all prior to about 2015 — making it extremely unlikely they originated with a man who passed away in 1965 .

false	in november 2018 , in the aftermath of several massive california wildfires , including the historically destructive and deadly camp fire , several items purporting to offer warnings or advice for people affected by those fires spread widely online . one example , presented as several news outlets reported on the potential for rain to develop in the still smoldering regions affected by the camp fire , was that the rain in these smoky regions would “ clean out ” the air but result in toxic rainfall : <PARA> such warnings made a specific assumption : water that falls as precipitation in smoky areas develops toxicity prior to its hitting the ground . this is clear both in the post ’ s explicit statement that the rain will be “ extremely toxic ,” and in the implicit assumptions inherent in the post ’ s tips for potentially avoiding that danger . the text refers to danger to pets during the storm , for example , and suggests the water that falls on your clothing ( presumably from precipitation ) requires a change of garb . <PARA> how this danger would present itself , although not actually described in the post , could conceivably be explained by one of two mechanisms . first , it could be that toxin - containing particulate matter in the smoke will necessarily become contained within the raindrops that fall to the ground , on your clothing , or on your pet . a second possibility is that people have conflated rain following a wildfire with acid rain , which forms in the presence of sulfuric ( and to a lesser degree nitric ) gases released from burning fossil fuels . either of these mechanisms as an explanation for how rain following a wildfire could be dangerous is lacking , however . <PARA> acid rain is principally caused by the emission of sulfur dioxide ( so2 ) from burning fossil fuels , which becomes sulfuric acid that is incorporated into rainfall . fossil fuels ( i . e ., rocks , gases , and oils derived from material that was once living but has been converted into a mess of flammable carbon - based compounds over millions of years ) are naturally likely to contain sulfur compounds . though fossil fuels are generally produced from the sulfur - free carbon of microscopic organisms , the conditions such material is exposed to over time often introduces sulfur into the chemical matrix . it is this sulfur that is most responsible for acid rain . <PARA> wildfires , on the other hand , involve the burning of currently ( or recently ) living carbon products such as trees and brush , which have not undergone any processes that would incorporate large quantities of sulfur into them . therefore , the gas emitted by wildfires is dominated by carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide with little to no sulfur dioxide . these escaping gases do not serve to acidify the rain in any meaningful way . <PARA> no doubt the smoke from wildfires , especially those that burn through residential areas ( as in the case of the camp fire ), contains myriad dangerous toxic chemicals that can harm human health . indeed , smoke has the potential to contain a cornucopia of toxins : <PARA> this is one of the reasons why the air quality index in regions downwind of the camp fire ( and others ) is so poor , and why people have been warned to stay inside or wear masks . if , however , the fear is that these materials will get incorporated into the rain , then that explanation is unworkable , and the reason is simple : that particulate matter is no longer there . instead , the most dangerous particulate matter produced by the camp fire has been diluted and dispersed across a massive stretch of land to the south . <PARA> we reached out to the california department of water resources to ask about the claims made of toxic rain following wildfires , and our query was forwarded to the california air resource board . there , a spokesperson told us via email that the toxic rain claims were dubious due to the migration of particulate matter after the fire : “ emission from homes and other structures that burned already dispersed with the prevailing winds last week . the smoke we are seeing now comes from vegetative matter still burning .” <PARA> the california air resource board also told us it was unlikely that particulate matter could become incorporated into california rain even if it existed in high concentrations in the area of the fire : “ large - scale weather systems ( like the one california expected and received late last week ), tend to dilute wildfire smoke to a point where it becomes nontoxic to human health .” <PARA> for those two reasons , it is unlikely the rain that falls in “ smoke affected areas ” contains much in the way of dangerous particulate material , toxic or otherwise . <PARA> some confusion regarding the danger posed by rain following wildfires can potentially be linked to the real potential for toxic effects to water bodies in fire - burned regions . wildfires can affect the health of aqueous ecosystems , although not via a process that involves the transportation of toxins through raindrops . instead , the mechanism would be from the increased runoff of sediment and ground chemicals into water bodies as a result of the loss of roots and vegetation : <PARA> one primary water quality concern after a wildfire is nutrient loading . burning vegetation frees up substantial amounts of key nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen , which can lead to massive algal blooms that deprive water of its oxygen — killing animals while producing toxins : <PARA> while these threats are real and accurately described as the result of rain falling on burned areas , it would be inaccurate to suggest that the rain itself contained toxins or other health risks . the dangerous effects would begin only after the water had fallen on the ground . <PARA> rain following wildfires poses unique risks to burned areas . most significantly , the lack of vegetation makes catastrophic mudslides much more likely . while firefighters working the camp fire were looking forward to the fire -

true	in november 2018 , election officials in florida began a statewide recount after very close results in several elections , including high - profile and closely - scrutinized contests for the governorship and a u . s . senate seat . <PARA> in the u . s . senate race , outgoing republican governor rick scott led democratic incumbent bill nelson by less than 0 . 5 percent of all the votes cast , and in the gubernatorial contest , republican former u . s . representative ron desantis led democratic mayor of tallahassee andrew gillum by a similarly fine margin . <PARA> chapter 102 . 141 ( 7 ) of the florida statutes prescribes that where the preliminary results of an election give one candidate a lead of less than 0 . 5 percent of all the votes cast , that situation automatically triggers a recount : <PARA> on 10 november , republican secretary of state ken detzner fulfilled his legal obligations by ordering a machine recount in both races . immediately after the order came down , some activists and observers on the right began to allege that the recount was being conducted in a fraudulent way by perceived liberal election officials intent on reversing the narrow leads held by the republican candidates . <PARA> these claims of electoral fraud were led by governor rick scott himself as well as president donald trump , who claimed on twitter , without citing any evidence , that an effort was under way to “ steal ” the senate and gubernatorial elections . <PARA> on 12 november , trump appeared to call for the recounts to be halted and said scott and desantis should be declared winners , due to what he claimed — again without evidence — was electoral fraud which had “ massively infected ” the counting of ballots : <PARA> in response to this tweet , some news reports claimed that trump ’ s call for the preliminary results to be finalized meant that the ballots mailed by u . s . military personnel stationed overseas would not be counted . the new york daily news carried the headline “ trump demand would eliminate active service members ’ votes in florida midterms ,” adding : <PARA> the new york post , for their part , reported that : <PARA> the reason , according to both articles , was that florida law requires all valid overseas ballots , including those cast by military service members , to be counted and provides a 10 - day window after election day for this to take place . this is entirely accurate . chapter 101 . 6952 ( 5 ) of the florida statues states the following : <PARA> since the date of the election in 2018 was 6 november , overseas mail - in ballots will be eligible to be counted after 16 november , provided they were postmarked no later than 6 november and otherwise valid . as confirmed on the web site of the florida division of elections , those ballots had not yet been counted as of 12 november . <PARA> in his tweet , president trump wrote “ must go with election night ” and urged that “ the florida election should be called in favor of rick scott and ron desantis .” at the time he wrote this ( 12 november ), the 10 - day extension overseas ballots had not yet been counted . <PARA> therefore , if trump ’ s proposal were carried out , the election of scott and desantis would indeed by finalized based on the initial election results and without taking into account the legitimate votes of floridians overseas , including military service members . <PARA> the central claim contained in articles by the new york daily news and new york post is therefore largely accurate , although their headlines do take some rhetorical license by emphasizing the hypothetical effect on military personnel , when votes by all floridians overseas would be adversely affected . <PARA> furthermore , it ’ s worth noting that it is not specifically president trump ’ s apparent call for the recount to be ended which would cause overseas and military votes to be excluded , but rather his call for the preliminary election results to be finalized four days before the deadline for overseas ballots . ( trump did not explicitly call for the recount to be ended , but he did say the election day results should be finalized and claimed that “ an honest vote count is no longer possible .”) <PARA> the new york post ‘ s headline averred that “ trump ’ s demand to end florida recount could discount military votes ,” and the new york daily news reported that “ president trump on monday demanded that election officials stop counting votes in florida ’ s razor - thin midterms and instead “ go with ” the election day results — a proposal that would effectively exclude active duty u . s . soldiers from having their voices heard .” <PARA> these descriptions are not entirely accurate , since those overseas military ballots have not yet all been received or counted in the first place and so cannot be counted a second time . although it would almost certainly be a violation of florida law , ending the recount would not in itself prevent ordinary election procedures from taking place ( including the eventual counting of overseas ballots after 16 november ), but finalizing the preliminary election day results would . <PARA> just as ending the current legally - mandated recount would almost certainly breach florida statutes , any attempt to finalize the elections of scott and desantis before counting overseas mail - in ballots would also almost certainly be a breach of florida law and a serious violation of the voting rights of that cohort of u . s . citizens overseas . <PARA> furthermore , those ballots could potentially prove crucial to the ultimate outcome of one or both elections , even if a recount were not already under way . according to a 2017 report by the florida department of state , overseas voters mailed in 77 , 802 valid ballots in the 2016 general election , comprising 0 . 81 % of the 9 . 6 million ballots cast that year . <PARA> if overseas ballots comprised a similar percentage of this year ’ s total of 8 . 3 million , that would equate to 67 , 158 votes . according to associated press figures published by the new york times , rick scott ’ s lead over bill nelson was just 12 , 536 , before the recount began . ron desantis ’ lead over andrew gillum was 33 , 669 votes . <PARA> to put those numbers into perspective , after florida ’ s machine recount in the 2000 presidential election , george w . bush won victory in the state , and with it the u . s . presidency , by a margin of just 537 votes .	
true	both police and school officials in wisconsin launched an investigation into a photograph of local high school students flashing a nazi salute after a journalist posted the picture online . <PARA> on 11 november 2018 reporter jules suzdaltsev posted the picture of a group of boys , reportedly comprising baraboo high school ’ s entire male graduating class of 2019 , with several of them visibly flashing the extended - arm “ sieg heil ” gesture . his tweet was shared more than 14 , 000 times within 24 hours : <PARA> “ i was contacted by a former student who shared with me a post she made about the photo , which was posted by a student run page with the caption , ‘ we even got the black kid to throw it up # barabooproud ,'” suzdaltsev told us via email a day after posting the photograph . “ i was not familiar with the school , but the photo was shocking and i assumed it would be shocking to others as well .” <PARA> suzdaltsev followed up by posting screenshots of messages he received from other baraboo students accusing the boys seen in the photograph of posting racist and misogynist harassment : <PARA> other students accused the school of ignoring requests for help , and one said to suzdaltsev that when they informed an official that one of the boys in the photograph yelled “ white power ” in the hallway , they were told to “ look up videos of black lives matter protesters being violent to police and that [ they ] should grow a tougher skin .” <PARA> another student said that the gesture was suggested to the boys by the photographer . a student seen in the picture told the same thing to television news outlets : <PARA> suzdaltsev attributed the picture to a photography company , wheel memories , who removed a june 2018 post containing the image and replaced it with a message decrying the criticism that was mounting online : <PARA> wheel memories did not respond to a request for comment prior to publication . <PARA> the story was picked up by both local and national news outlets , and the auschwitz memorial museum in poland also criticized the photograph on twitter , saying : <PARA> both the baraboo school district and its head administrator , lori mueller , released an identical statement : <PARA> the school district also sent a letter to parents : <PARA> “ it ’ s very disappointing that this photo has been around for a while , and the school only reacted when it was published publicly ,” suzdaltsev told us . <PARA> he also asserted on twitter that after he posted the photograph , personal information of his was posted on the same platform without his consent , a practice commonly known as “ doxxing ,” but that twitter had failed to respond to his requests for help . <PARA> a twitter spokesperson would not comment . suzdaltsev later said that twitter support staff “ reached out personally to rectify ” the issue . <PARA> the baraboo school district did not respond to a request for comment .	
false	in november 2018 , a viral facebook post claimed that a report produced by the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) had concluded the claims of sexual assault and impropriety made against supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh were all false . <PARA> in the summer and autumn of 2018 , three women came forward to accuse kavanaugh of alcohol - fueled sexual misconduct while he was a high school and college student , allegations which kavanaugh denied and which dominated the political news cycle for weeks , threatening to derail the confirmation of president donald trump ’ s nominee . <PARA> the fbi played an important role throughout the episode . when kavanaugh ’ s primary accuser , psychology professor dr . christine blasey ford , publicly accused him of sexually assaulting her at a high school party in maryland in the early 1980s , the white house faced mounting calls to have the fbi to conduct an investigation into the issue <PARA> in late september , after dramatic senate judiciary committee hearings which featured both blasey ford and kavanaugh , the committee voted to approve kavanaugh ’ s nomination be put to a full senate vote , but only on condition that the fbi specifically investigate the most recent allegations against him ( that agency ’ s already having conducted the standard background check which they perform for any presidential nominee ). <PARA> in the end , the fbi undertook an investigation , and the u . s . senate confirmed kavanaugh ’ s nomination , and he was sworn in as a supreme court justice on 6 october . <PARA> against that background , a widely - shared 4 november facebook post by thomas smith claimed that a subsequent report by the fbi had concluded that “ none of the kavanaugh accusations were true ”: <PARA> in reality , the fbi had not said that , and the claim made in the facebook post was misleading . on 4 october , the senate judiciary committee published a press release announcing that the fbi had completed the additional week - long investigation requested as part of the committee ’ s earlier vote to approve kavanaugh ’ s nomination to the senate and stated : <PARA> the fbi investigation did not conclude that “ none of the kavanaugh accusations were true .” according to the judiciary committee ’ s synopsis , it concluded that the fbi was unable within the given timeframe to corroborate the allegations made by blasey ford ( or by deborah ramirez , who also accused kavanaugh of having exposed himself to her during a party at yale ). <PARA> the fbi ’ s conclusion allowed that the allegations against kavanaugh might indeed have all been false , but it did not rule out the possibility that one or more of them might have been true . it is a crucial distinction that the facebook post completely overlooked . <PARA> on 2 november , senate judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley published a detailed , 400 - page update on the committee ’ s investigation into the sexual assault and misconduct allegations against kavanaugh , an investigation which has expanded to examine the possibility of “ violations of senate rules , potential witness tampering , and potential false statements made to the committee in violation of federal law .” <PARA> the judiciary committee has conducted many interviews with relevant individuals and examined a large quantity of evidence from various sources , including all of the fbi ’ s previous background checks on kavanaugh , as well as its supplementary october 2018 investigation , and their conclusion was as follows : <PARA> the judiciary committee , based on evidence which included the fbi ’ s investigations , did not conclude that the allegations against kavanaugh were false . rather , they said that they had not turned up any evidence that would support or confirm those allegations .

false	president donald trump has pursued a starkly different approach to environmental policy than his predecessor , barack obama , whose agenda prioritized replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources and taking action to stem global warming . <PARA> since trump became president , his administration has reversed many obama - era initiatives in order to make environmental laws more business - friendly . <PARA> one exception was trump ’ s signing in october 2018 of bipartisan legislation aimed at reducing the amount of garbage ( mainly plastic debris ) littering the world ’ s oceans and threatening sea life . called the save our seas act of 2018 ( s . 3508 ), the bill was described by the activist group ocean conservancy as “ a small but significant piece of legislation ” showing “ leadership in the global fight to tackle the marine debris crisis .” <PARA> the act reauthorized the existing national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) marine debris program for another five years and called for more international cooperation in the effort to clean up the world ’ s oceans . ocean conservancy reported of the bill that : <PARA> president trump signed the bill on 11 october 2018 , and soon afterward a meme began making the rounds of social media criticizing the news media for ( allegedly ) failing to report on the legislation : <PARA> the meme echoed a complaint often uttered by trump himself that the mainstream news media ignore his positive accomplishments , dwelling on the negative instead . <PARA> when we searched for press coverage of the save our oceans act , however , we found that a number of national news organizations had , in fact , reported on its passage and signing . associated press ran an article , “ trump signs save our seas act into law ,” that was syndicated in dozens of daily newspapers and websites across the country . united press international syndicated a similar article . bloomberg ran a story emphasizing trump ’ s remarks during the signing ceremony criticizing japan and china for continuing to dump plastic waste into the oceans . we did not find coverage in the new york times . <PARA> we also observed that cnn had covered trump ’ s signing of the bill on at least two occasions . on 11 october , cnn ’ s inside politics aired a portion of the ceremony live in which trump , flanked by commerce secretary wilbur ross , noaa administrator admiral tim gallaudet , and sen . dan sullivan ( r - alaska ), expounded on the need for the legislation and what it would do . and a 16 october article on cnn . com mentioned the signing of the bill in the context of the deployment of an apparatus designed to retrieve plastic waste from the ocean . <PARA> we couldn ’ t find coverage on the prime time news shows of broadcast networks abc and nbc ( nor on cable network msnbc ), though we did turn up an article on the cbs news website giving advance notice of the signing ceremony . <PARA> it ’ s valid to ask whether the enactment of legislation whose main import is the renewal of an existing federal program is all that newsworthy in the first place . when president obama signed a virtually identical bill in 2012 ( reauthorizing and expanding the scope of the noaa ’ s marine debris program ), it appeared to have received no national press coverage at all .

false	in october 2018 , a facebook video of a chemical being mixed with water went viral when it was combined with the assertion that it somehow demonstrated an effort to create a dangerous milk imposter . the account sharing the post indicated that the phenomenon had spread all the way to nairobi , kenya , and warned that “ we need to be extra careful about what we are buying ”: <PARA> the only evidence providing support for the suggestion that the final product was “ milk ” was that the solution was white and opaque . such a description can apply to myriad other chemical concoctions , however , so there is no reason to assume that a milk substitute beverage is what is seen being created in the clip . <PARA> based on the color of the chemical added , it is likely that brown liquid is the antiseptic liquid formulation of dettol , an internationally popular line of cleaning and first - aid products with the active ingredient of chloroxylenol . their antiseptic liquid solution is stored as a brown oil prior to being diluted with water , after which it turns milky white . this fact is a major part of the company ’ s marketing imagery — for example , it is included in this commercial for the product designed for the same kenyan audience whom the facebook video is purportedly directed towards : <PARA> dettol liquid antiseptic solution is a mixture of chloroxylenol , oils , and alcohols , including castor oil and terpineol . when combined with water , this mixture forms an emulsion — a colloid mixture of liquids unable to dissolve into one another and which instead form a dispersion of tiny droplets throughout the water . <PARA> the word ‘ emulsion ’ comes from the latin word emulgeo ( to milk ), and these mixtures are often cloudy and white as a result of the tyndall effect : the scattering of light that occurs in colloidal substances . actual dairy milk , it bears mentioning , is white for the same reason as the liquid in the video : it is an emulsion . in the case of actual milk , however , the emulsion contains butterfat globules and water , not dettol and water .	
false	in october 2018 , multiple parcels housing mail bombs were sent to various democrats and critics of president trump , including the clintons , the obamas , joe biden , george soros , and actor robert de niro . according to various accounts , the packages included “ explosive devices made from pvc pipe and contained a timer ( likely a digital alarm clock ) to set off the detonator . the powder contained in the bombs comes from pyrotechnics . x - rays show there was likely shrapnel inside the pvc pipe .” none of the devices detonated , and no one was injured by them . <PARA> the devices were typically sent in lumpy manila envelopes bearing the return address of ex - democratic national committee chair rep . debbie wasserman schultz and six postage stamps . conspiracy - minded persons quickly seized on that last aspect to sow doubt on the claims that the packages had actually been mailed through the usps and instead fostered a theory that the bombs were a “ false flag ” operation intended to influence the upcoming midterm elections . their evidence ? that the stamps seen in news pictures of the packages were uncancelled , demonstrating that the parcels had not in fact gone through the mail system : <PARA> stamps used for mailed items are generally postmarked , or “ cancelled ” — that is , as the mailed items make their way through the postal system , the stamps are marked with wavy black lines and a postmark bearing the location and date of first processing in order to prevent the re - use of the stamps . so , the conspiracy logic went , a package bearing uncancelled stamps clearly could not have actually been shipped through the postal system . <PARA> however , it ’ s not the case that the every item sent through the u . s . postal service is postmarked . the agency ’ s own page on the subject notes that “ postmarks are not required for mailings bearing a permit , meter , or precanceled stamp for postage , nor to pieces with an indicia applied by various postage evidencing systems .” <PARA> none of those exceptions seemed applicable to the packages containing the explosive devices , however , as they bore ordinary stamps and not postage metering or precanceled stamps . however , the fact is that a whole lot of mailed items do actually make their way through the usps system without being cancelled , as washington tv station wusa noted : <PARA> and as nbc news observed more specifically , in this case the nature of the packaging explained why these particular parcels were not postmarked : <PARA> on 26 october 2018 , 56 - year - old florida resident cesar sayoc was arrested on suspicion of having mailed the explosive devices :	
unproven	with only three weeks left to go before the 2018 midterm elections , a cnn poll showed republican incumbent ted cruz leading democratic challenger beto o ’ rourke by seven percentage points among likely texas voters in the race for cruz ’ s u . s . senate seat . <PARA> while the candidates faced off in debates and television ads , social media users shared partisan memes aimed at swaying readers for or against one or the other candidate , according to their preferences . those memes were often based more on fiction than on fact . <PARA> one such meme sought to make an issue of ted cruz ’ s wealth , asserting that his net worth had increased dramatically during his time in the senate despite his fixed government salary : <PARA> as far as we can tell , the only figure the meme states accurately is cruz ’ s salary . according to the u . s . senate ’ s website , all sitting senators ( excluding leaders ) earn $ 174 , 000 per year . <PARA> we were unable to locate any reliable sources reporting that cruz ’ s current net worth is $ 4 . 6 million . according to the most recent estimate we could find ( from a 4 october 2018 article in the texas tribune ), cruz ’ s financial disclosure forms showed that , as of 2017 , he and his wife heidi ( a managing director at the goldman sachs investment firm ) owned between $ 2 million and $ 5 million in assets ( including stocks , mutual funds , retirement benefits , and a partially repayable loan to cruz ’ s 2012 election campaign ). they also had liabilities ranging from $ 1 million to $ 5 . 3 million . subtracting the liabilities from the assets yields an estimated net worth of , at most , $ 4 million . the actual number could be far less , possibly in the negative . <PARA> although the $ 4 . 6 million figure cited in the meme isn ’ t implausible , we don ’ t know how it was arrived at , or by whom . nor were we able to ascertain where the other amount cited — cruz ’ s alleged net worth of $ 500 , 000 in 2012 — came from . according to the go - to source for such appraisals , opensecrets . org ( the website of the center for responsible politics ), cruz was already worth an estimated $ 3 . 47 million in 2012 . <PARA> it ’ s important to note that we only have estimates to work with . candidates are required to disclose assets , liabilities , transactions , gifts , reimbursements , and certain kinds of expenditures on their personal financial disclosure forms , but not their overall net worth . moreover , they ’ re asked to report these amounts in terms of high and low ranges , not exact figures . this is how opensecrets . org arrives at an estimated net worth for each candidate : <PARA> here are opensecret . org ’ s annual estimates of ted cruz ’ s net worth between 2011 and the most recent year for which they analyzed the data , 2015 : <PARA> so , although cruz ’ s estimated net worth may have increased after he entered the senate in 2013 , it seemingly wasn ’ t as dramatic an increase as portrayed , nor was it a particularly shocking one given that his wife was the family ’ s primary breadwinner most of that time . <PARA> in fact , heidi cruz inadvertently supplied more fodder for partisan attacks on the couple ’ s wealth by suggesting in an october 2018 interview with the atlantic that they wouldn ’ t be able to afford purchasing a second home any time soon . the subject came up in a discussion about the hardships of being a senator ’ s spouse : <PARA> left - leaning commentators attempted to sow class resentment by portraying her as “ complaining ” about her husband ’ s six - figure salary , but that ’ s a gambit that cuts both ways . as pointed out in a recent associated press analysis , cruz ’ s challenger , democrat beto o ’ rourke , had an estimated 2015 net worth of $ 9 million , more than double that of cruz . <PARA> we reached out to sen . cruz ’ s reelection campaign for comment , but have not yet received a reply .	
false	on 20 october 2018 , twitter user mike allen posted a photograph of an injured police officer and stated that the pictured individual had been “ brutalized ” by a member of the migrant caravan that was making its way toward the united states in the fall of 2018 : <PARA> facebook user jacque guinan posted a nearly verbatim message which included two additional images of police officers who were also allegedly “ brutalized ” by this caravan of refugees : <PARA> we also found a network of smaller twitter accounts parroting the same verbatim claim : “ mexican police are being brutalized by members of this caravan as they attempt to force their way into mexico ”: <PARA> a caravan of migrants fleeing political and social unrest in their home country of honduras was slowly making its way north in the fall of 2018 with the hopes that its participants could seek asylum in the united states . some conservative pundits and politicians used this group of migrants to stoke fears about immigration . florida representative matt gaetz even floated an unfounded conspiracy theory positing ( without evidence ) that these refugees were being paid by alt - right boogeyman george soros . president trump , too , declared ( without evidence ) that this group consisted of “ criminals ” and “ unknown middle easteners .” <PARA> the above - displayed photographs appear to be yet another attempt to smear this group of refugees and stoke fears over immigration . these pictures do not capture police officers who were brutalized by members of the immigrant caravan making its way toward the united states in october 2018 — they ’ re all several years old and depict the aftermath of altercations between police officers and protesters in mexico . <PARA> the main photograph attached to this rumor ( showing an officer with a bloodied face ) came from a 2012 incident involving students ( not migrants ) and police officers near mexico city . revista emeequis reported that the students had been staging a protest at the school for more than a week when police officers came in and attempted to evict them from the building . more than 170 students were detained and at least 9 officers were injured during the altercation : <PARA> the two other photographs attached to this rumor were also years - old and unrelated to migrant caravans . the image showing an injured officer on his knees on the street was taken in 2014 in chilpancingo and was included in a gallery of photographs on the mexican newspaper el universal ‘ s web site and depicted another violent incident between police and students . according to bbc news , tensions between the police and protesters had been rising since a group of 43 students went missing a few months earlier in september 2014 : <PARA> the other image associated with this rumor was also snapped several years earlier and was in no way related to a honduran migrant caravan . the photograph displaying an officer with a bloodied lip has been online since at least 2011 , when it was shared in articles concerning another altercation between “ police and teachers ”:	
false	on 17 october 2018 , united states congressman matt gaetz ( r - fl ) posted a video to twitter and suggested , without evidence , that it showed a group of people being paid by billionaire george soros to join a migrant caravan and storm the united states border : <PARA> this tweet was replete with factual inaccuracies and baseless accusations . <PARA> congressman matt gaetz said that the clip presented “ footage in honduras ,” but the video was actually shot in guatemala , where the pictured refugees were lined up in front of an auto shop in chiquimula . the facebook page for that business features an image of the same sign that can be seen in the background of the video : <PARA> the michiquimula facebook page , a local site dedicated to information about chiquimula , also posted a photograph showing this group of people lined up outside of the same buildings on 16 october 2018 , the day before gaetz shared his video : <PARA> gaetz eventually relented and admitted that he had been wrong about the location of the video : <PARA> rep . gaetz also said that this video captured women and children being paid “ 2 join the caravan & storm the us border ” ( i . e ., join a group of honduran migrants seeking to reach the u . s ). this , too , was inaccurate . <PARA> the michiquimula facebook page reported that this group was already en route to the united states when they stopped in the guatemalan city to board a bus . in other words , these people were not paid to “ join ” the caravan , as they were already a part of it : <PARA> guatemalan journalist luis assardo managed to speak with some of the locals and confirmed to splinter news that these migrants were already a part of the caravan , and that they were given some money to help them get by and not as an inducement to “ join ” the trek . <PARA> gaetz also suggested that right - wing bogeyman george soros was paying this group to “ storm the us border .” no evidence supports this claim , but plenty refutes it . <PARA> george soros ’ name is often invoked by conspiracy theorists who assert he is a “ puppet master ” controlling world events . president trump similarly accused the hungarian billionaire ( without evidence ) on 5 october 2018 of paying protesters during the confirmation hearings for supreme court justice brett kavanaugh , <PARA> but let ’ s not dismiss this claim on its face just because other similar accusations about soros have proved baseless . <PARA> the people seen in this video — virtually all of whom were women , female children , and women with small children — apparently each received a single banknote as they walked down a line , but the largest banknote in guatemala is worth 200 quetzales ( approximately $ 25 ). gaetz suggested in his tweet that soros was paying this group of people to “ join ” a caravan and “ storm ” the u . s . border . if his accusation were true , that would mean that hundreds of vulnerable people decided to uproot their lives and embark on a nearly 1 , 500 - mile journey at the risk of deportation , imprisonment , and having their children taken away from them , in order to interfere with an election that they were not directly involved in , all for $ 25 or less . <PARA> another commenter noted the same thing , saying the travelers had received even less than 200 quetzales : <PARA> the open society foundation , which was founded by george soros , responded to gaetz on twitter to note that neither they nor soros had anything to do with these events : <PARA> in addition to the logical gymnastics required to make sense of gaetz ’ accusation , assardo reported that the money was likely raised by local merchants in the community and given to the refugees so that they could purchase supplies for their journey : <PARA> we reached out to rep . gaetz for more information about how he obtained this footage , what information was passed to him along with the video , and how he arrived at the conclusion that it showed people being paid by george soros to join a caravan and storm the united states border . we did notreceive a response prior to publication .	
mixture	with october marking domestic violence awareness month in the u . s ., readers contacted us regarding a graphic circulating online sharing an alarming statistic regarding homicide rates for partners who obtained restraining orders . <PARA> the graphic , which was unattributed but bore the hashtag # dvam2018 , read as follows : <PARA> the figures were taken from a 2008 study regarding intimate partner homicides ( iph ). although the data presented in the meme was accurate , it lacked some context provided by the original source and therefore could be potentially misleading when taken in isolation . <PARA> according to that study : <PARA> while the numbers used in the meme were quoted accurately , we are rating this item as a mixture because it doesn ’ t mention that the overwhelming majority of iph victims reported by the survey who were killed by intimates ( 89 %) did not have restraining orders in place . omitting this piece of information could create a false impression regarding the effectiveness of restraining or protective orders , and more recent data supports their use as a deterrent against intimate partner violence . <PARA> a 2011 study published by the carsey school of public policy at the university of new hampshire found that the quality of life improved for the 213 women they surveyed who had received civil protective orders . half the women reported that the orders were not violated , and the majority of respondents reported declines in “ days of distress and sleep loss ” after obtaining those orders . <PARA> the report concluded by noting : <PARA> we contacted katherine vittes , the lead researcher for the 2008 study cited in the meme , seeking comment but did not receive a response prior to publication .	
mixture	one of the common elements of the halloween night trick - or - treat tradition is adults ’ grumbling that some of the kids coming to their houses seeking candy are “ too big ” or “ too old ” for such an activity . although there are no universal rules about who may engage in trick - or - treating — and some people feel everyone should be free to participate , including adults of all ages — general consensus seems to be that kids should be looking to enjoy halloween activities other than collecting candy door - to - door once they reach middle or high school age . <PARA> as halloween approached in 2018 , many social media users began sharing ( and questioning ) what appeared to be a municipal ordinance for chesapeake , virginia , which limited “ trick - or - treat activities ” by law to children aged 12 and under : <PARA> this image does reproduce a section of chesapeake ’ s code of ordinances ( enacted in 1970 ), which not only sets a maximum age for trick - or - treaters ( 12 ), but also establishes an end time for that activity on halloween night ( 8 : 00 pm ): <PARA> chesapeake is not unique in having such an ordinance , but these types of laws are not generally intended to require children to carry id with them and subject them to arrest if they ’ re a little overage or stay out a few minutes late on halloween night . often these kinds of regulations have been on the books ( largely unenforced ) for decades , and were initially passed to address particular ancillary problems , such as older kids ’ harassing and taking candy from smaller children , or strangers ’ using the occasion to lure children into their cars . <PARA> as the virginian - pilot reported in 2015 , a similar law still in effect in hampton roads stemmed from incidents that had taken place one halloween night nearly fifty years earlier : <PARA> for the most part , such laws merely serve to provide a basis for police to intervene when necessary before a given situation gets out of control . the virginian - pilot article noted that halloween trick - or - treating regulations in surrounding areas were seldom enforced to the point of anyone ’ s actually being charged with violating the law : <PARA> indeed , the city of chesapeake ’ s website proclaims that the goal of the rules is to ensure halloween “ evening is safe for everyone ,” not for police to be “ actively seeking out violations of the time or age limits ”:	
mixture	in october 2018 , before the controversial confirmation of judge brett kavanaugh as a supreme court justice , the left - wing facebook page “ the other 98 %” posted a meme which hinted at a degree of irony or hypocrisy in one of kavanaugh ’ s past opinions : <PARA> as indicated in the meme , this argument originated in a 2 october tweet by a twitter user called <USER> <PARA> part of the point of this tweet was to present a level of irony or even hypocrisy on the part of kavanaugh . in september 2018 , dr . christine blasey ford came forward with an allegation that kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in the early 1980s , when she was 15 years old and kavanaugh was 17 years old — the same age as the pregnant girl at the heart of the court case in question . <PARA> if kavanaugh ’ s stance towards the girl was that she must be forced to delay her abortion because he believed she needed to contemplate that “ what you do at 17 follows you forever ,” then according to the implicit logic of the tweet , kavanaugh ought to have the same rigorous moral judgment applied to his alleged actions as a 17 - year - old . <PARA> the tweet , and the “ other 98 %” meme which followed , are indeed based on an opinion given by kavanaugh in a case that came before the district of columbia circuit of the u . s . court of appeals in the autumn of 2017 . and kavanaugh did indeed rule that the young woman could be forced to further delay obtaining an abortion until she was placed with her immigration sponsor . however , the meme embellished certain parts of the case and overlooked significant nuance in kavanaugh ’ s argument . <PARA> background <PARA> the case in question revolved around a young woman from central america known as “ jane doe ,” who unlawfully entered the united states in september 2017 at the age of 17 . her court - appointed legal guardian and attorney , rochelle garza , gave the following account of her circumstances in written testimony that she later presented to the senate judiciary committee in opposition to kavanaugh ’ s confirmation to the supreme court : <PARA> what followed was weeks of somewhat complicated legal wrangling involving the office of refugee resettlement ( an agency of the department of health and human services ), the department of justice , and the young woman ’ s lawyers , as various government actors insisted that she undergo counselling , ultrasounds , and other delays and preconditions before terminating her pregnancy . <PARA> on 13 october 2017 , garza and the american civil liberties union sued eric hargan , the acting health and human services secretary , and other government agencies and officials , seeking ( on jane doe ’ s behalf ) a federal court injunction preventing the government from further delaying or obstructing jane doe ’ s access to an abortion . <PARA> the plaintiffs argued that the federal government was violating the young woman ’ s constitutional right to an abortion , as set out in the landmark supreme court decision in roe v . wade , maintaining that although the state has a right to insist on certain requirements before an abortion can take place ( such as counselling , parental consent , and 24 - hour waiting periods ), the obstacles put before jane doe had amounted to an “ undue burden ” — a legal standard set out in another major abortion - related supreme court decision , planned parenthood v . casey . <PARA> in the 13 october lawsuit , jane doe ’ s lawyers wrote that : <PARA> the united states district court in the district of columbia sided with jane doe ’ s attorneys , and on 18 october they granted the restraining order against the government , whose lawyers immediately appealed , thus sending the case to the u . s . court of appeals for the district of columbia ( the “ d . c . circuit ”). <PARA> kavanaugh ’ s role <PARA> on 20 october 2017 , three judges on the d . c . circuit — brett kavanaugh , karen henderson and patricia millett — ruled 2 - 1 in favor of the government ’ s appeal , ordering a pause on the restraining order which was set to clear the way for jane doe ’ s abortion . judge millett dissented from the ruling , which read : <PARA> under the terms of the 20 october ruling , the government would be given 11 days ( until 31 october ) to find a sponsor for jane doe ( typically a relative or friend already living in the united states ) and transfer her into their custody before allowing her to obtain the abortion . if no sponsor could be found by then , the d . c . circuit court could re - enter their restraining order against the government , paving the way for jane doe ’ s abortion , while the government could once again appeal , potentially bringing the case before the court of appeals for a second time . <PARA> two days later , the aclu asked for the government ’ s appeal to be reconsidered , this time by a full court of all eleven d . c . circuit judges . two days after that , on 24 october , the court overturned the three - judge panel ’ s ruling and dismissed the government ’ s appeal . according to garza ’ s testimony , jane doe obtained an abortion the next day , when she was 15 weeks pregnant . <PARA> in his dissent from the 24 october ruling , kavanaugh essentially argued that insisting jane doe be transferred into the custody of her immigration sponsor before being allowed to obtain an abortion was not an “ undue burden ” on her , “ so long as the transfer is expeditious .” thus , he argued , the government had not violated her constitutional right to an abortion by seeking this precondition : <PARA> garza would later reject one of the premises of this argument , that jane doe should be placed in more comfortable and stable surroundings before making her decision , insisting that her client became resolved in her decision to have an abortion as soon as she discovered she was pregnant , several weeks before the court of appeals ruling and kavanaugh ’ s dissent : <PARA> conclusion <PARA> it is true that judge kavanaugh issued a ruling on 20 october 2017 which would have forced an unlawful immigrant 17 - year - old to further delay her abortion , but his reasoning was not precisely that she must wait “ until she really really thought about it maturely because what you do at 17 follows you forever ,” as mayday mindy ’ s tweet described it . <PARA> in his dissent , kavanaugh did write that the girl was faced with a “ major life decision ,” and that it might be preferable for her to make that decision in the custody of an immigration sponsor rather than in the less stable and more isolated environment of federal detention . <PARA> however , in legal terms kavanaugh was specifically ruling that it would not violate the girl ’ s constitutional right to an abortion for the state to insist on transferring her into the custody of an immigration sponsor first , provided that process was “ expeditious .” <PARA> finally , the girl ’ s pregnancy does not appear to have been the result of a rape , despite mayday mindy ’ s claim . none of the court records we examined , nor rochelle garza ’ s testimony before the senate judiciary committee , contained any reference to jane doe ’ s having been raped .	
true	in september 2018 , a new jersey - based law enforcement operation codenamed “ operation open house ” yielded 24 arrests of men alleged to have attempted to groom children for sex using mobile chat apps . <PARA> the multi - agency sting operation , which involved state , local , and federal law enforcement agencies and hinged upon undercover officers posing online as underage girls and boys , prompted a widely - shared report by the nj . com news website which carried the headline “ predators are using fortnite to lure kids . cops say parents need to worry ”: <PARA> along with other alarming reports , such as those published by thatsinappropriate . com and scarymommy . com , nj . com ’ s article prompted multiple concerned inquiries from readers about the use of gaming apps such as fortnite by those seeking to groom children for sex . fortnite was the only app named in the headlines of all three of those articles . <PARA> in reality , despite its phenomenal popularity , fortnite was not used by any of the 24 men arrested and charged with attempting to lure children for sex online in new jersey in september 2018 . however , it has been used by other would - be sexual predators in the past , the state attorney general ’ s office told us . <PARA> in an 18 september press release announcing the arrests , the office of attorney general gurbir grewal outlined the basics of operation open house and detailed the allegations against the 24 defendants : <PARA> a spokesperson for attorney general grewal confirmed to us by email that the only apps used by the 24 defendants arrested in september 2018 were the chatting apps kik , scout , whisper and , grindr : “ none of the 24 defendants used the three gaming apps mentioned ( fortnite , minecraft or discord ). those were used by defendants in prior cases . the four listed apps were the only ones used . gmail was used in one case , and other defendants also texted ... ” <PARA> so fortnite , which was the focus of several news articles about the operation open house arrests , only featured in passing in the attorney general ’ s press release , and only in reference to previous grooming investigations and not the one which led to 24 arrests in september 2018 : <PARA> that does not mean parents do not need to be vigilant about their children ’ s use of gaming apps such as fortnite and minecraft . at a press conference announcing the arrests , grewal highlighted a parental warning produced and shared by his office , which asked parents to become familiar with 19 popular apps , four of which were used by would - be predators in the context of operation open house , and the other 15 in previous cases : <PARA> conclusion <PARA> according to the new jersey attorney general ’ s office , the gaming apps fortnite , minecraft , and discord are among several apps popular among teenagers and children but also used by would - be sexual predators for the purpose of grooming . four chatting apps were used by 24 men arrested in september 2018 as part of an undercover sting operation which yielded serious charges including attempted sexual assault . <PARA> however , fortnite , minecraft , and discord were not used by the 24 men arrested in that particular sweep , despite the fact that several news reports focused heavily on those apps and mentioned only fortnite in their headlines .	
false	in september 2018 , a number of attempts were made to smear the reputations or motivations of various women who came forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh . baseless rumors were circulated claiming that various photographs showed dr . christine blasey ford getting blackout drunk ( false ), that ford had also accused neil gorsuch of sexual assault ( false ), that photographs showed ford with alt - right boogeyman george soros ( false ), and that deborah ramirez had won a fellowship from soros ’ s open society foundation ( surprise , that one ’ s false too ). <PARA> on 26 september 2018 , yet another attempt to discredit kavanaugh ’ s accusers started to gain traction , but this time it was promulgated by mainstream media outlets such as tmz in addition to the regular lineup of internet trolls . the infamous gossip outlet published a photograph which they stated showed debra katz , the lawyer representing dr . ford , walking out of a house with hillary clinton : <PARA> this image was also pushed by conspiracy theorists seemingly convinced that kavanaugh accusers ford , ramirez , and julie swetnick were part of some nefarious plot funded by george soros and hillary clinton to keep kavanaugh from getting a seat on the supreme court : <PARA> but this photograph was not taken recently , nor does it show debra katz with hillary clinton . <PARA> this photograph was taken in 2016 after a fundraiser for hillary clinton ’ s presidential campaign held at a private home in southampton , new york . the scene , which was captured by associated press photographer andrew harnik , was originally captioned : “ democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton , center , leaves a fundraiser at a private home in southampton , n . y ., sunday , aug . 28 , 2016 .” <PARA> although the woman behind hillary clinton in this photograph may bare a passing resemblance to debra katz , the pictured woman is actually clinton ’ s official campaign photographer , barbara kinney . <PARA> here ’ s a comparison of kinney ( taken from her instagram page ) and kinney ( taken from the viral photograph ): <PARA> barbara kinney confirmed to us via email that she was indeed the woman seen with hillary clinton in the viral photograph . <PARA> tmz eventually removed the photograph from their article and added the following update : “ earlier , we posted a pic of hillary with a woman who ’ d mistakenly been identified as katz , but it wasn ’ t her .”	
false	a viral piece of text concerning the relationship between the united states and its northern neighbor canada is often attributed to robert meadows , a circuit court judge in florida . this essay is frequently preceded by the title “ thank you canada ,” the byline of robert meadows ( circuit court judge , florida ), and the statement that the piece is “ one american ’ s take on the growing trade war with the us and canada ”: <PARA> this essay does offer “ one american ’ s take ” on the relationship between the united states and canada , but that american is a resident of portland , oregon , and not a florida judge . <PARA> this text was first posted online by facebook user bruce lindner on 7 june 2018 , shortly after president trump announced that he would be imposing steel and aluminum tariffs on imports from canada . it opened by imploring readers to “ consider how lucky we americans are to have the neighbors we have ”: <PARA> lindner ’ s original post is nearly identical to the viral version incorrectly attributed to meadows , with the notable exception of the closing line . the original version written by lindner ended with a dig at conservative politicians and their perceived allegiance to don and vlad ( president trump and vladimir putin ): <PARA> lindner ’ s post was shared more than 70 , 000 times , and his name remained attached to the post for at least a month . as his writing was copied and pasted by various facebook users , however , the text was eventually stripped of mention of its original author . it ’ s unclear how judge meadows ’ name became associated with this text , but by september 2018 this piece was nearly always introduced with the statement that it was written by a judge in florida . <PARA> a few weeks after lindner ’ s post went viral , he returned to facebook to post a brief followup message about the reach of his original piece :	
false	on 21 september 2018 , joshua feuerstein , an american evangelical internet personality who is perhaps best known for stirring up controversy over starbucks christmas cups , shared a photograph to his facebook page purportedly showing a nude model walking the runway with four young girls and claimed that the image documented the “ liberal left ” attempting to “ normalize pedophilia ”: <PARA> this photograph is genuine in the sense that it truly captures a nude man in the presence of four young girls , but feurenstein ’ s post did not properly provide the context in which it was taken . <PARA> to begin with , this picture was taken in brazil and not the united states , so it therefore has little to do with how the “ liberal left ” in america is supposedly attempting to “ normalize pedophilia .” this image also doesn ’ t show a nude man “ walking the runway ” ( presumably at some form of fashion show ). this photograph was taken at the conclusion of a performance of “ la bête ” by choreographer wagner schwartz , held at the goethe - institute in salvador , brazil , in 2017 . <PARA> la bête is an interactive performance in which audience members can take the stage and move schwartz ’ s nude body in any position they choose . according to the the centre national de la danse , this piece was inspired by “ bicho ,” an adjustable metal sculpture created by brazilian artist lygia clark in the 1960s : <PARA> although feuerstein presented this image as if it depicted some sort of modeling event featuring male nude models and children , la bête was not specifically geared toward minors . most of the images and videos we ’ ve found of this performance feature adults interacting with wagner ’ s body . here ’ s a video of one such performance . <PARA> [ nsfw : the following footage contains nudity ]: <PARA> however , children were indeed present at some of these performances . <PARA> the viral photograph included in feurenstein ’ s post was taken at the goethe institute in 2017 , while a video taken from a separate performance ( which can be viewed here ) and showing a young child and her mother interacting with schwartz ’ body was taken at the museu de arte moderna de são paulo . <PARA> these pieces of media were widely circulated in september 2017 along with accusations that schwartz was a pedophile , and a criminal investigation was opened to determine if schwartz or the museums had committed a crime ( they did not ) during this performance . <PARA> the spanish - language el país newspaper provided some context to this controversy in a february 2018 article ( translated via google ): <PARA> the museu de arte moderna de são paulo and the goethe - institut both published statements on facebook asserting that this performance was not erotic or pornographic , nor was it associated with pedophilia . both museums also noted that visitors were informed beforehand that the performances would involve nudity : <PARA> schwartz talked about the controversy in an interview with el país :

false	on 18 september 2018 , a thread was started on the “ pol ” section of 4chan imageboard website asking users to dig up dirt on christine blasey ford ( a psychology professor at palo alto university who accused supreme court nominee judge brett kavanaugh of having sexually assaulted her while they were in high school ) in order to “ prove ( that ) she is a liar ” and to “ save maga ”: <PARA> the thread quickly filled up with unfounded accusations and derogatory and sexist comments . while some participants attempted to paint ford as an alcoholic or a criminal , one user shared an image which purportedly showed ford holding a “ not my president ” sign at an anti - trump rally . a few hours later , that image was turned into a meme and shared on the “ overpass for america ” facebook page in a post attempting to “ introduce ” their fans to kavanaugh ’ s accuser : <PARA> the claim that the pictured woman is christine blasey ford was made up out of whole cloth , however . <PARA> this photograph was taken on 12 november 2016 at a protest against president trump in new york city by photographer christopher penler . the image is available on a variety of stock photograph websites , where it is consistently presented as an image of an anonymous woman with a “ not my president ” sign . it wasn ’ t until christine blasey ford came forward with an allegation of sexual assault against supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh in september 2018 that the picture started circulating with ford ’ s name attached to it . <PARA> we compared an image of ford ( right ) with the woman in this meme ( left ) and found that other than both pictures ’ showing blonde white women wearing sunglasses , they don ’ t have much resemblance : <PARA> furthermore , the same user who posted the above - displayed photograph also posted a second picture in the same 4chan thread which supposedly showed ford at another trump protest . but the second photograph also featured an entirely different woman : <PARA> life news used this “ facts matter ” image to illustrate their story about christine blasey ford , despite the fact ( facts do matter , after all ) that the picture was actually one of a woman named liz darner taken at the march for science in april 2017 and not a picture of ford . <PARA> it appears that those who were attempting to smear ford as some sort of unreliable partisan were simply searching for images of any woman at a trump protest who bore a passing resemblance to kavanaugh ’ s accuser . this same tactic — purposefully misidentifying a face in the crowd in order to apply a political ideology to a known individual — was employed by conspiracy theorists in october 2017 to falsely link the man who killed nearly 60 people at a concert in las vegas to the democratic party .

true	when trayvon martin was shot and killed in february 2012 by george zimmerman , authorities found a pack of skittles in martin ’ s pocket that he had just purchased from a nearby 7 - eleven . for many people , this colorful candy became a symbol of the 17 - year - old ’ s youth and innocence . so when a photograph purportedly showing a bag of skittles autographed by george zimmerman started circulating on social media in september 2018 , it elicited several angry reactions . <PARA> rapper t . i ., for instance , shared the following set of images to his instagram page along with the following message : <PARA> these pictures come from a six - part television documentary entitled “ rest in power : the trayvon martin story ” that premiered on the paramount network in july 2018 . <PARA> the controversial image can be glimpsed at around the 27 minute mark of the final episode , as andy hallinan , the owner of a florida gun shop that teamed up with zimmerman to sell confederate flag paintings after his florida gun supply store was maligned for declaring itself as a “ muslim free zone ,” recounts a “ party trick ” zimmerman used to do for his fans : <PARA> zimmerman has a history of capitalizing on his notoriety . in may 2016 , for instance , he auctioned off the gun that he used to kill trayvon martin .	
false	as of this writing ( september 2018 ), a meme continues to circulate on social media holding that americans “ didn ’ t see ” news of the swearing - in of dr . jerome adams as surgeon general , because the “ news media ” purportedly didn ’ t want the public knowing that a supposedly “ racist ” president trump had “ appointed a black man to a prominent position ”: <PARA> dr . adams is an anesthesiologist who previously served as health commissioner of indiana , having been appointed to that post by indiana governor mike pence in 2014 . he was later nominated for the position of surgeon general of the united states by president donald trump and confirmed by the u . s . senate four days later . it ’ s true that hardly anyone has seen news coverage of dr . adams ’ swearing - in lately — because it ’ s old news , given that he took office well over a year ago , on 5 september 2017 . <PARA> and , rather than being ignored at the time , dr . adams ’ appointment was contemporaneously covered by national news outlets such as cnn , usa today , upi , and the associated press , as well as metropolitan newspapers such as the baltimore sun and the indianapolis star . <PARA> dr . adams also received a good of national press coverage in may 2018 when he assisted with a medical emergency on a delta air lines jet as he was preparing to fly to jackson , mississippi : <PARA> the putative point of this meme is somewhat undercut by the fact that trump white house does not include a single african - american among its senior staff . in fact , outside of dr . adams , the only black person to hold a prominent position in the trump administration is dr . ben carson , the housing and urban development secretary :	
mixture	chelsea clinton , who has stirred controversy in the past with her outspoken advocacy of women ’ s reproductive rights , provoked a new torrent of criticism with remarks she made during a 13 september 2018 siriusxm town hall discussion about the future of roe v . wade . <PARA> responding to a question about what motivates her to keep going in the multi - generational struggle to ensure safe access to abortion , clinton spoke of what life was like for women before roe v . wade and tied her feelings about the 1973 supreme court decision to her personal religious convictions : <PARA> there was indeed a swift partisan reaction to her remarks , which were sometimes paraphrased accurately by online news sources (“ chelsea clinton : it would be ‘ un - christian ’ to go back to pre - roe era ,” reported the washington examiner ) and other times re - worded to skew their meaning . <PARA> the pro - life websites lifenews . com and lifezette ran articles criticizing clinton ’ s statements under variants of the headline , “ chelsea clinton says it would be “ un - christian ” to protect babies from abortion .” there were other formulations ( including one site ’ s claim that clinton said it ’ s un - christian “ to not support slaughter of unborn ”), but the readers who contacted snopes asking us to authenticate the statement focused on the former . <PARA> clearly , chelsea clinton did not literally say it would be un - christian to protect babies from abortion . <PARA> one can argue in defense of that paraphrase by pointing out the obvious , that reversing roe v . wade would likely have the effect of reducing the number of abortions performed in the united states , but that logic works both ways . if it ’ s fair to equate “ it would be un - christian to go back to pre - roe days ” with “ it would be un - christian to protect babies from abortion ,” then it ’ s no less fair to equate “ the christian thing to do would be to reverse roe v . wade ” with ( using clinton ’ s formulation ) “ the christian thing to do would be to stop protecting women from being maimed and killed by illegal , unsafe abortion practices .” <PARA> what makes these jarring equivalencies possible is that each side in the abortion debate frames the issue in completely different terms and under a different set of moral priorities ( as revealed in the charged language both use , such as “ killing babies ” vs . “ women ’ s right to choose ”). for that matter , the clinton controversy shows that deep divisions exist even among people who call themselves christians as to what it means to be a sincere , “ deeply religious ” member of that faith . <PARA> we do not wish to take sides in this clash of world views , but merely to point out that so sharp is the disconnect between them that both are comfortable asserting that they ’ re upholding “ christian ” values while taking diametrically opposite stands on abortion . that each each finds the other ’ s viewpoint morally objectionable is not a surprise .

false	a popular bit of “ too crazy to be a coincidence ” trivia suggests that the location of the great pyramid of giza is in some way cosmically aligned with the universe ( or , perhaps , that the egyptians themselves aligned their pyramids with the universe ) because its latitude in decimal degrees is 29 . 9792458 n and the speed of light in a vacuum as expressed in the contemporary metric system is 299 , 792 , 458 meters per second : <PARA> it is true that the latitude 29 . 9792458 n intersects the great pyramid of giza ( at the selected longitude of around 31 . 134667 e ). however : <PARA> 1 ) if a point of latitude ’ s merely crossing a structure at any point is the bar to meet for revealing a hidden meaning to its location , then the latitudes between 29 . 980150 and 29 . 978150 ( all of which intersect the same pyramid ) also fit the bill , leaving a coincidence - monger roughly 2 , 000 numerical latitude formulations to choose from with respect to the great pyramid of giza . <PARA> 2 ) if the apex of the pyramid were meant to represent an homage to the fundamental laws of the universe , the correct latitude would actually be closer to 29 . 9791750 n , which would bear less resemblance to the speed of light in a vacuum expressed in meters per second . <PARA> 3 ) although the great pyramid of giza was constructed around 2550 bc , the notion that light “ traveled ” at all ( though discussed theoretically in ancient greek times and by early arab scholars ) was not firmly established until the first estimate of the speed of light was made in 1676 . <PARA> 4 ) the unit of measurement on which the speed of light is based in this meme — meters — was not defined until 1771 , making it a highly anachronistic one for the ancient egyptians to have been referencing . <PARA> 5 ) egyptians of that time would have been more likely to express such a theoretical concept as the speed of light in “ cubits ” per second . using 0 . 525 m as the estimated length of one ancient egyptian cubit puts the speed of light at 571 , 033 , 253 cubits per second . converting this number into latitude expressed in decimal degrees via the same approach would require the pyramid to be somewhere in western russia in order for its location to correspond to the speed of light . <PARA> 6 ) our system of referencing locations on the globe via latitude didn ’ t come into being until long after the construction of the great pyramid of giza . and decimal degree mapping at the level of precision implied by the meme relies upon exacting measurements of our globe that were not possible until the late 1900s . <PARA> all in all , this “ coincidence ” depends upon people who lived thousands of years ago having knowledge of concepts that weren ’ t discovered or created until much , much later in human history , and referencing systems of measurement that did not exist in their time and place .

unproven	on 19 august 2018 , social media users widely circulated a video taken with a cellphone that showed milwaukee county sheriff ’ s deputies approaching , with guns draw , a stopped vehicle occupied by a driver and passenger who were both african - american . in the video , the driver could be seen putting his hands out the car window and yelling at police , “ why you got your guns pointed at me , though ?” another voice off - camera promptly responded , “ because you ’ re not white .” <PARA> the video blew up on social media , creating outrage over what viewers believed to be a display of open racism by police officers : <PARA> however , according to acting milwaukee county sheriff richard schmidt , the person who made the comment was not one of the deputies , but rather an off - camera bystander . <PARA> schmidt hastily called a press conference the day the video circulated and announced that he had reviewed multiple recordings of the incident , including dashcam footage from the deputies ’ squad cars . he also said that had the statement been made by a deputy , he would have immediately suspended that person . <PARA> schmidt said not only was he confident that none of his deputies made the statement , but that one of them saw the person who did — a civilian bystander possibly occupying a green van : <PARA> a representative for the sheriff ’ s department said she would send us footage from the squad cars ’ dashcams for review via postal mail . <PARA> schmidt said the reason the deputies had their weapons pointed at the car was because the driver had sped past them at 70 to 85 miles per hour in a 30 mph zone and swerving into the right shoulder . deputies pursued the vehicle , during which time the driver ran a red light , and when the car finally came to a stop , schmidt said , the driver failed to follow orders to put the car in park and throw the keys out the window . in the end , schmidt noted , no force was used as both the driver and passenger got out of the car on their own . the driver was issued citations for traffic - related infractions .	
mixture	in august 2018 , several news outlets around the world reported on a rare sexually - transmitted infection contracted by a woman in england , offering that information under scary - sounding headlines which raised the specter of a “ flesh - eating std ” running rampant . <PARA> fox affiliates wfld ( in chicago ) and wttg ( in washington d . c .) both reported “‘ flesh - eating ’ std allegedly making the rounds ,” while the network ’ s rockford , illinois , affiliate wqrf went with the grammatically challenged “‘ flesh - eating ’ std causes genitals to ‘ rot away ’ making the rounds .” <PARA> these headlines created the impression that an unusually dangerous or gruesome std was increasing in its virality or prevalence . perhaps the most egregious example of this representation came from san francisco abc affiliate kgo - tv , which offered the headline “ researchers warn of resurgence of flesh eating std after it ’ s found in england ”: <PARA> neither kgo - tv ’ s article nor the accompanying video segment provided any details about the purported “ warning ” or the “ researchers ” who had supposedly given it , nor any explanation of what was meant by a “ resurgence ” of the disease or the claim that it was “ making a comeback .” <PARA> the basis of these sensationalized reports was a 22 august article from the english lancashire post newspaper , which read as follows : <PARA> this original article gave the reader plenty of important context , much of it missing from subsequent reporting by u . s . news outlets . <PARA> firstly , the disease is “ super - rare ,” and the basis of the article is a single diagnosis , itself apparently unprecedented in the u . k . <PARA> so not only did u . s . news reports mislead viewers and readers by claiming “ researchers ” had “ warned ” about the disease ( donovanosis ), but they did so on the basis of just one diagnosis of a person living in southport , near liverpool — thousands of miles away from those news outlets ’ american audiences . <PARA> as for claims that donovanosis is “ making the rounds ” or that a “ resurgence ” in the spread of the disease has occurred , nothing in the original lancashire post report ( or anywhere else ) supported those contentions . <PARA> any claim that a disease is becoming more prevalent or undergoing a “ resurgence ” must first provide data to demonstrate what its prevalence was during an earlier period of time , and then make a methodologically robust comparison with its prevalence during a more recent period of time . it must also clearly explain the geographical area or areas in which this putative resurgence is taking place . <PARA> a single ( apparently unprecedented ) diagnosis of a disease in england does not constitute a trend , and certainly not one with any epidemiological implications for viewers in illinois , washington , d . c ., and california . <PARA> second , the lancashire post article provided some context on what was meant by “ flesh - eating .” as popular science noted , “‘ flesh - eating ’ is just a scary way of saying an infection is destroying tissue .” in this case , the disease ( donovanosis ) only begins to destroy healthy tissue ( i . e ., becomes “ flesh - eating ”) if ulcers attendant with it are left untreated and allowed to spread : <PARA> according to the centers for disease control , the treatment of donovanosis ( also known as granuloma inguinale ) can be tricky , consisting of at least three weeks on oral antibiotics with the possibility of relapse after between six and eighteen months . <PARA> however , serious destruction of tissue is not a necessary consequence of being infected with donovanosis . so the “ flesh - eating std ” which formed the basis of so many frightening news reports and headlines in august 2018 was only “ flesh - eating ” under certain uncommon and preventable circumstances . nothing in the original lancashire post article established that the infection actually reached this stage in the single case of the woman they reported on . <PARA> while readers should of course take the usual precautions in order to protect themselves and others from contracting any sexually - transmitted diseases , the manner in which several u . s . news outlets described a single diagnosis of donovanosis in england had the effect of sensationalizing the implications for the public and included some elements of misleading or erroneous misinformation .

( for example , compare how the cross looks in the image above in which clinton is wearing a light - green sweater to how it looks in higher - resolution images taken on the same occasion in 2006 .) <PARA> last , here is a higher - quality image of clinton wearing her greek cross pendant at a social function in 2005 : <PARA> embed from getty images <PARA> as to whether or not it ’ s legitimate to conclude that someone wearing an upside - down cross is ipso facto demonstrating “ fealty to satan ” or membership in a satanic church , we quote hector molina of the catholic answers website : <PARA> that having been said , some people who call themselves “ satanists ” do wear upside - down crosses and / or crucifixes . according to the church of satan ’ s website , they do not regard the inverted cross as an official symbol , but members may wear such items if they find “ personal meaning ” in the gesture : <PARA> another high - profile organization claiming an affiliation with satan , the satanic temple ( best known for erecting a statue of a deity called baphomet outside the arkansas state capitol building in august 2018 ), gives a more prominent place to the upside - down cross . this description of preparations for a “ satanic ritual ” is from one of the temple ’ s websites : <PARA> and there was this report in the 12 july 2018 edition of the indianapolis star : <PARA> it should be noted , however , that neither the church of satan nor the satanic temple subscribes to a literal belief in satan . both groups , on the contrary , completely reject theism and the attendant worship of supernatural beings ( including satan ), grounding their philosophies in rational self - interest and individualism instead .

true	u . s . vice president mike pence ’ s august 2018 announcement of plans for the creation of a sixth branch of the u . s . military dubbed “ space force ” drew mixed reactions from pundits , politicians , and trump administration supporters and critics . retired astronaut mark kelly was one of those who supposedly chimed in on the issue , as reflected in a meme circulated by social media users that quoted him as opining that the proposed space force was a “ dumb idea ”: <PARA> this is a genuine quote from mark kelly , who flew several missions on nasa ’ s space shuttle from 2001 to 2011 . the wording was taken from a tweet the former astronaut posted in june 2018 shortly after president trump directed the pentagon to “ begin the process necessary to establish a space force as the sixth branch of the armed forces ”: <PARA> kelly elaborated on his position in an interview with msnbc which took place shortly after vice president pence ’ s announcement , saying that he stood by his “ dumb idea ” remark and that a space force would be redundant : <PARA> michael dodge , an assistant professor in the department of space studies at the university of north dakota , noted space . com that while other branches of the military ( such as the u . s . air force ) also started out as sectors of larger branches , the existence of the air force space command ( afspc ) would not necessarily be redundant because it would “ free up the air force to focus on what it does best ”: <PARA> another former astronaut , buzz aldrin , offered a different reaction to the new military branch . the apollo 11 lunar module pilot was in attendance in june 2018 when president trump announced his intention to create a space force and later tweeted that the idea was “ one giant leap ” in the right direction :	
false	the arrest of five adults for child abuse in august 2018 at a new mexico compound where the principal suspect was accused of training children to be school shooters took an unexpected turn when far - right websites declared that the suspect ’ s father , a well - known muslim cleric , had been a keynote speaker at the 2012 democratic national convention . <PARA> one of those sites , true pundit , reported on 9 august that siraj wahhaj , who is the american - born imam of the al - taqwa mosque in brooklyn , new york , spoke at the charlotte , north carolina , convention where president obama was nominated to run for a second term in office : <PARA> the article is correct in stating that imam wahhaj is the father of siraj ibn wahhaj , who was one of the five arrested in new mexico and is under investigation in the death of an unidentified child whose body was found on the compound . the imam acknowledged their relationship ( as well as his familial connections to the other four suspects ) during a press conference one week after the arrests . <PARA> however , the claim that wahhaj was the keynote speaker at the 2012 democratic national convention , and therefore somehow connected to obama , is false , basically a regurgitation of a years - old , politically - motivated internet rumor . wahhaj neither participated in nor spoke at that convention . <PARA> the rumor that wahhaj was supposedly going to speak at the 2012 dnc erupted on right - wing blogs and websites during the weeks leading up to the september 2012 event . it so happened that an islamic group called the bureau of indigenous muslim affairs ( bima ) announced it would host several public events , including an open - air prayer gathering ( to be called “ jumah at the 2012 dnc ”) the weekend before the convention . the prayer gathering was slated to take place in marshall park ( about a mile from the convention center ) on friday , 31 august 2012 ( four days before the convention opened on 4 september ). it was announced that imam siraj wahhaj would lead the friday prayer . <PARA> jumah at the 2012 dnc did take place , but it was not an official democratic national convention event . it wasn ’ t organized or sponsored by the democratic party , and it was over before the convention even started . it never appeared on the party ’ s roster of official convention activities . according to the charlotte observer , the bima prayer meeting was one of about a thousand “ nonofficial convention - related events ” planned by independent groups to coincide with the democratic party gathering . <PARA> however , those facts did not stop hyperpartisan websites from publishing articles stating variants of the following : <PARA> the false claim that the convention would open with a muslim prayer was ultimately coupled with another false rumor to the effect that the democratic national committee had rejected an offer by cardinal timothy dolan , the archbishop of new york , to deliver a christian prayer at the event . but there was no muslim prayer , and dolan did , in fact , deliver the closing benediction at the 2012 democratic national convention . <PARA> the keynote speaker at that convention was then - san antonio mayor julian castro . he is a roman catholic , not a muslim . <PARA> it is a fact that imam siraj wahhaj led a prayer at an islamic event ( jumah at the 2012 dnc ) that took place in charlotte , north carolina , a few days before the opening of the convention that would deliver barack obama his second democratic presidential nomination . <PARA> in partisan hands , this morphed into the rumor that wahhaj led a prayer at the democratic national convention itself , which in turn has morphed into the rumor that wahhaj was the keynote speaker at the convention , and therefore somehow intimately connected to democratic party politics and obama ’ s presidency . those rumors are false .	
mixture	in may 2018 , a twitter user shared a photograph showing a san bernardino county sheriff ’ s deputy praying before his shift , along with text suggesting that the department ’ s posting of the picture had brought “ scrutiny ” upon them : <PARA> this picture is indeed a photograph of a san bernardino county sheriff ’ s deputy kneeling in prayer . but although a handful of social media users posted comments in response to its posting that invoked concerns about the separation of church and state , the overwhelming majority of users expressed positive comments that did not result in any additional “ scrutiny ” being brought upon the department . <PARA> this photograph was originally posted to the social media pages of the san bernardino sheriff ’ s department and the sbsd ’ s yucaipa police station on 1 may 2018 . the yucaipa police post included a message stating that the photograph captured deputy wedge praying for the safety of his partner and the community : <PARA> this picture is now often shared as if it became the center of a raging controversy , but in fact the majority of comments posted on the social media pages of these law enforcement agencies were positive . the san bernardino sheriff ’ s department even published a response on facebook thanking the community for their support : <PARA> lt . porter of the yucaipa police station also responded to one facebook user who was curious about the “ controversy ” surrounding this image . porter explained that the photograph had originally been accompanied by a bible verse and that a few people had posted comments referencing separation of church and state issues . however , porter also noted that the overall response to the image had been “ overwhelmingly positive and supportive ”: <PARA> examining the edit history of the san bernardino county sheriff ’ s post reveals that it was originally posted in conjunction with the bible verse “ blessed are the peacemakers , for they will be called children of god ” — matthew 5 : 9 .” ( this verse was later removed when the post was edited .) <PARA> we were able to find only a handful of vaguely critical messages out of the 2 , 000 - some - odd comments posted in response to this photograph on the two aforementioned facebook pages . these comments tended to focus more on separation of church and state issues ( particularly the use of a bible verse ) and less on criticism of religion , the deputy , or his employer : <PARA> in general , the majority of users voiced support for the officer , a handful expressed sentiments similar to the one displayed just above , and the rest complained about how this photograph shouldn ’ t really be controversial . <PARA> cynthia bachman , the public information officer of the san bernardino county sheriff ’ s department , told us in an email that there were “ many comments regarding the separation of church and state .” and while bachman said that “ scrutiny ” might be an appropriate word for the situation , she added that this controversy didn ’ t warrant any changes to the department ’ s social media policies :

true	in july 2018 , an investigation by the conservative middle east forum think tank hit the headlines , after it appeared to reveal that an office within the u . s . treasury department had in 2015 signed off on the transfer of $ 125 , 000 to the islamic relief agency , a sudan - based group listed as a funder of terrorism by the treasury itself . <PARA> the 25 july middle east forum ( mef ) report , which was accompanied by an article in the conservative national review , reported : <PARA> the report gave rise to coverage by the right - wing daily wire web site , which attributed the funding decision to former president barack obama personally in a headline reading “ obama knowingly funded designated al - qaeda affiliate ,” as well as by fox news , which reported : <PARA> the facts and sequence of events presented by the mef are broadly accurate and were largely confirmed to us by an official from the international charity world vision , which acted in partnership with the islamic relief agency ( isra ) in sudan until 2015 . <PARA> however , contrary to the daily wire ’ s headline , we found no evidence that former president barack obama himself had any role in either of the two funding decisions related to isra which are at the heart of the mef ’ s report . <PARA> background <PARA> in 2004 , the u . s . treasury department added the islamic relief agency and several individuals associated with it to a list of organizations and individuals suspected of funding terrorism , blocking its assets and bank accounts in the united states and making it a criminal offense for anyone in the united states to support or conduct financial transactions with isra . <PARA> in announcing their decision , the treasury department cited evidence that isra ( and its officials ) had links to osama bin laden , al - qaeda , the taliban , and others within global islamic terrorist networks . <PARA> apart from its inclusion on the u . s . government ’ s list of terrorism funders , isra performed charitable works in parts of the muslim world — including sudan , where they partnered with the u . s .- based evangelical christian non - profit organization world vision , which in turn received funding and support from the u . s . government , largely through the u . s . agency for international development ( usaid ). <PARA> sequence of events <PARA> in march 2014 , usaid signed off on a $ 723 , 405 grant to world vision , with isra designated to receive a $ 200 , 000 sub - grant from that amount . a world vision official closely involved in the matter told us that , before listing isra as a sub - grantee , the organization had searched the treasury ’ s “ sanctions list ” for any group operating in sudan with “ islamic relief ” in their name but turned up no matches , indicating isra was not blocked . a usaid official told us that the $ 200 , 000 set aside for isra was to go towards humanitarian aid to people displaced by the ongoing conflict in sudan at that time . <PARA> in november 2014 , according to the world vision official with whom we spoke , the organization was alerted to the possibility that isra might be on the treasury ’ s list of blocked groups and conveyed those concerns to the treasury department ’ s office of foreign assets control ( ofac ), which is responsible for implementing and tracking economic sanctions . <PARA> the official told us that world vision then voluntarily stopped working with isra while ofac investigated isra ’ s status . this contradicted the account of a usaid official , who told us that usaid had instructed world vision to put a hold on all their activities with isra . <PARA> the world vision official broadly confirmed mef ’ s claims , which were based on emails released under the freedom of information act , that world vision was eager for ofac to quickly clarify the status of isra , telling us that the organization was frustrated by the delay in what should have been a straightforward verification of records . <PARA> in january 2015 , ofac finally confirmed that the sudan - based islamic relief agency to which usaid had granted $ 200 , 000 was indeed on the u . s . treasury ’ s sanctions list . this meant world vision ( like any other u . s .- based entity or person ) could not provide isra any support or engage in any financial transactions with that group . <PARA> however , world vision still owed isra money for services isra had already provided in sudan , on the basis of the $ 200 , 000 sub - grant awarded by usaid the previous march . but ofac ’ s january 2015 ruling meant that isra could not be reimbursed for that work , so world vision applied to ofac for a license to meet those contractual obligations . <PARA> the world vision official told us that the indefinite halt to their work with isra had put a severe strain on world vision ’ s relationship with the sudanese government . world vision staff in sudan had been experiencing harassment related to their debts to isra , the official said , and they felt they were at real risk of being kicked out of the country altogether — which would have spelled the end of their humanitarian work there . paying their remaining debts to isra felt like the cost and condition of world vision ’ s being allowed to continue working in sudan , the official told us . <PARA> in the end , ofac accepted world vision ’ s application and granted them a license for a one - off transfer of $ 125 , 000 to isra , which a usaid official told us was for humanitarian assistance work that isra had already performed . <PARA> a world vision spokesperson told us that the $ 125 , 000 transferred to isra came from “ usaid funds ,” confirming both the middle east forum and fox news ’ description of it as “ taxpayer money .” in a statement , the spokesperson wrote : <PARA> conclusion <PARA> the middle east forum is correct in their central claim that an office of the treasury department , which had confirmed isra was listed as a sanctioned entity , subsequently permitted a private ngo ( world vision ) to transfer funds to isra . <PARA> insofar as every office and agency of every federal government department between 2009 and 2016 was a part of the “ obama administration ,” it can justifiably be said that this decision was made by the obama administration . however , we saw no evidence that the decision was made by anyone beyond ofac , least of all by president obama himself . <PARA> we asked the treasury department which official directed the license to be given to world vision for the may 2015 transfer , but an official told us ofac does not discuss or comment on individual cases . we also contacted john smith , who was ofac ’ s director during the period outlined by the middle east forum , but did not receive a response in time for publication .	
false	phasing out the distribution of single - use plastic straws for environmental reasons has become a focus of government and business policy in recent years , and in july 2018 the giant starbucks coffee chain announced that they intended to eliminate plastic straws from their stores by 2020 . shortly after starbucks issued that announcement , an image was derisively circulated via social media that purportedly documented the company ’ s ( seemingly nonsensical ) approach to the issue — switching to paper straws individually enclosed in single - use plastic wrappers : <PARA> the items shown in this picture can indeed be found at some starbucks locations , but not as an offered alternative to plastic straws . <PARA> in fact , starbucks is not relying on paper straws to completely replace plastic straws at their stores . rather , the company will be expanding their deployment of strawless lids in order to eliminate plastic straw use : <PARA> fortune magazine also noted that while most drinks at starbucks will soon be served with strawless lids , the company will also use straws made of alternative materials ( such as paper or compostable plastic ) to be made available upon customer request . <PARA> the straws shown in the viral social media image are not starbucks ’ solution to the plastic straw issue ; rather , they ’ re “ flavored iced coffee ” straws ( sometimes sold as “ candy straws “) which are available for purchase at some starbucks locations : <PARA> starbucks also offers edible “ cookie straws ” often sold with their frappuccino drinks .

ranking officials — including the republic ’ s two consuls , cicero and gaius antonius hybrida ( known as “ hybrida ”). <PARA> the roman republic was led by two executives , known as “ consuls “, who were elected to one - year , non - consecutive terms by the centuriate assembly ( composed of roman citizens ). the assembly elected cicero and hybrida to serve as consuls in 63 b . c . e , much to the resentment of catilina , who had unsuccessfully campaigned for the same office . <PARA> cicero found out about catilina ’ s conspiracy and , invoking emergency powers , had some of its leaders arrested and executed without trial . catilina himself was killed in battle alongside his troops , while attempting a somewhat futile march on rome . <PARA> five years later , a roman politician named publius clodius pulcher (“ clodius ”) proposed a set of laws , including one which would make it punishable by death to execute any roman citizen without trial . as a result , cicero faced the prospect of being exiled from rome , or even executed , over his earlier order to put to death the leaders of the catiline conspiracy . these events prompted the imagined scene in which caldwell put the words in question into cicero ’ s mouth , as he defended his actions before the senate : <PARA> cicero went into exile , as the historians plutarch and cassius dio recounted , but only for around a year before returning to rome after the senate voted in favor of recalling him . in 43 b . c . e ., he was assassinated at the behest of mark anthony , a supporter of julius caesar ’ s who served in the second triumvirate after caesar ’ s assassination . <PARA> these facts provide one clue that the quotation in the meme is not authentic as offered : it is dated to 42 b . c . e ., a year after cicero died . <PARA> cicero did not write or utter the words attributed to the fictionalized version of him created by caldwell , and we found no evidence of any similar phrases occurring in either the orator ’ s own letters and speeches or the accounts of historians such as plutarch and cassius dio who documented this period in roman history . <PARA> however , cicero did vehemently attack catilina ( as he similarly attacked many other roman politicians , throughout his career ) in a series of speeches known as the catiline orations , delivered in the roman senate during the catiline conspiracy and after the capture of its ringleaders . <PARA> the speech from caldwell ’ s novel at times resembles cicero ’ s actual attacks on catilina in certain stylistic ways — for example cicero ’ s description of catilina ’ s secrecy and underhandedness , in the first oration : <PARA> cicero likened catilina and his co - conspirators to a disease upon the roman republic , and also warned about the threat from within the city , just as he did in caldwell ’ s fictional speech , describing catilina as “ an enemy in the city ” and declaring that “ the only plots against us are within our own walls — the danger is within — the enemy is within .” <PARA> usage in american political debate <PARA> caldwell ’ s “ treason ” speech , falsely attributed to cicero , has occasionally featured in american political debate for decades , in various contexts , and with various politicians or ideologies positioned as the “ traitor ” in question . <PARA> in fact , the misattribution began within months of the publication of a pillar of iron . in october 1965 , the segregationist chief justice of the florida supreme court , millard caldwell ( no relation to the author ), gave a speech to the association of american physicians and surgeons using an extended metaphor to compare the decline of the roman republic with the perceived decline of conservative mores and individual rights in the united states at that time . <PARA> among a series of correctly attributed quotations from cicero , caldwell included the “ treason ” speech from a pillar of iron , which had been a best - seller that year , adding : “ does that sound like 1965 and the subversives in high places who have been exposed , and those who are not yet exposed ?” <PARA> in may 1995 , the militia of montana ( a paramilitary anti - government group known for spreading conspiracy theories ) was invited to give a statement to the u . s senate judiciary committee ’ s subcommittee on terrorism , which was examining the subject of domestic terrorism just weeks after the oklahoma city bombing . <PARA> in their statement , the militia group included a section of caldwell ’ s “ treason from within ” speech , although not attributing to any source : <PARA> in recent years , internet users taking part in political debates have used the quotation to target “ progressives ,” in the context of the reauthorization of the patriot act in 2006 , the administration of former u . s . president barack obama , in the context of the 2015 iranian nuclear deal . <PARA> another statement about the necessity of balancing budgets , also part of the dialogue invented by taylor caldwell for a pillar of iron , has similarly been attributed as the genuine words of cicero for the last several decades . ( a more recent list wrongly ascribed to cicero ’ s offering of a description of “ the situation during his lifetime ” originated with a source other than caldwell ’ s book .) <PARA> the application of the faux cicero “ treason ” quotation to president trump began before his helsinki press conference with putin , and this “ two thousand year old warning ” meme appears to have first been posted in august 2017 by the anti - trump facebook page “ politicked .”	
false	a guest appearance by fox news channel host judge jeanine pirro on the tv daytime talk show the view in july 2018 resulted in some angry words between pirro and view co - host whoopi goldberg : <PARA> although this heated disagreement continued for a bit backstage after the cameras turned off , it did not , as some twitter users have claimed , end with whoopi goldberg ’ s using a racial slur in reference to the fox news personality : <PARA> ( the phrase “ sand nigger ” is a derogatory and offensive term used to refer to persons of middle eastern or north african descent . pirro was born in the u . s . to lebanese - american parents .) <PARA> both pirro and goldberg addressed their verbal altercation during subsequent segments of the view and pirro ’ s justice with judge jeanine fox news show . while the two television personalities disagreed on some of the details ( pirro said that whoopi told her to get “ the f * ck out ” and spat on her , whoopi denied this happened and claimed that pirro cursed everyone at the view as she left the building ), pirro did not assert , nor did goldberg admit , that any racial slur was used . <PARA> here ’ s how pirro addressed her controversial appearance on the view during the “ opening statement ” portion of her show : <PARA> here ’ s goldberg ’ s follow - up on the view : <PARA> goldberg and pirro may have disagreed on who was at fault for their squabble , but neither of them claimed or suggested that a racial slur had been directed by one of them at the other . nor has anyone who was present when the incident took place come forward to offer anything substantiating that rumor . <PARA> the accusation that goldberg called pirro a “ sand n *** er ” did not originate with a credible news report , video evidence , or even a first - hand account of the argument . rather , it came from the above - displayed tweet , issued by an account that has previously published unsubstantiated accusations from unknown sources . <PARA> when we inquired of lauri hogan , the publicity director of abc television network , about this matter , she vehemently denied that whoopi goldberg ever used the term “ sand n *** er ” during her heated exchange with pirro , saying “ this absolutely is false . whoopi did not call jeanine pirro that name used in the tweet or anything like it .” <PARA> we reached out to both whoopi goldberg and jeanine pirro but have yet to receive a response .	
false	on 13 july 2016 , the website iflscience posted an article with an intentionally absurd headline : “ marijuana contains ‘ alien dna ’ from outside of our solar system , nasa confirms .” the article actually had nothing to do with marijuana genetics or extraterrestrial dna , but instead was intended to be a demonstration of how often people will share articles on social media without reading them : <PARA> that people do not read what they share is well supported by multiple studies . a columbia university study , mentioned in the iflscience article , found that 59 percent of links shared on twitter had never actually been clicked , for example . <PARA> in what could be viewed as an ironic and unintended consequence of the success of iflscience ’ s demonstration of the power of headlines , several clickbait websites have plagiarized the entire article , further populating the internet with the false headline claim . most recently , the website “ sci - tech universe ” posted the same article in its entirety , generating nearly 100 , 000 shares in just a few days . <PARA> it is unclear , of course , how many of those sharers read the article .

mixture	in the first half of 2018 , gun violence re - emerged as a major political social issue in the united states amidst a series of high - profile mass shootings , including the 14 february massacre at marjory stoneman douglas high school in parkland , florida , that left seventeen students and staff dead ( and a like number wounded ). <PARA> in the wake of a 28 june shooting spree at the offices of the capital gazette newspaper in annapolis , maryland , public attention once again turned to some of the statistics involved in mass shootings and gun violence in the united states . <PARA> on 2 july , the hyperpartisan left - wing occupy democrats facebook page posted a widely - shared meme that made some striking factual claims about the race and gender dimensions of mass shootings , claiming that of the “ 154 mass shootings this year ... not one [ was ] committed by a black man or an illegal alien ... [ or ] by a woman , either ”: <PARA> the meme didn ’ t cite any specific sources , but the number of shootings it cited ( 154 ) strongly indicated that it was based on data collected by the gun violence archive , a washington d . c .- based non - profit that tracks and records gun violence . in the aftermath of the capital gazette shooting , reports by nbc and business insider stated that that incident marked the 154th mass shooting of the year so far , and latter attributed that figure to the gun violence archive . <PARA> categorizing and measuring gun violence — especially mass shootings — is therefore notoriously difficult due to varying definitions and incomplete data collection . <PARA> varying definitions of a mass shooting <PARA> no uniformly accepted definition of “ mass shooting ” exists . historically , the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) defined what they call “ active shooter incidents ” as those that result in four or more people ( not including the attacker ) being shot dead in public through actions not related to terrorism , gang activity , or the commission of other crimes ( such as robbery ). since 2013 , the fbi has dropped that numerical threshold to incidents involving the deaths of three or more people . <PARA> everytown for gun control , a pro - gun control non - profit that collects data on shootings , also defines a mass shooting as one in which at least four people are killed ( not including the shooter ) but includes shootings taking place in private homes , a circumstance the fbi omits from their methodology . <PARA> mother jones magazine , in their mass shootings database , defines such shootings as “ indiscriminate rampages in public places resulting in four or more victims killed by the attacker .” <PARA> stanford university ’ s now - defunct mass shootings in america project defined a mass shooting as one in which three or more people were shot ( but not necessarily killed ), excluding the attacker . stanford ’ s definition excluded gang -, drug -, or organized crime - related shootings . <PARA> the mass shooting tracker , a crowd - sourced project , defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are shot , including the attacker . <PARA> of the major sources of data about mass shootings , the gun violence archive has a relatively inclusive definition : “ if four or more people are shot or killed in a single incident , not [ including ] the shooter , that incident is categorized as a mass shooting based purely on that numerical threshold .” this includes shootings in private places , incidents involving gang activity and armed robbery , shootouts , and non - fatal shootings . <PARA> these widely varying definitions explain why the gun violence archive charted the number of mass shootings between 1 january and 28 june 2018 at above 150 , while mother jones , for example , put it at a mere six . <PARA> we ’ re going to evaluate the occupy democrats meme first on its own terms — that is , using the apparent source of the claim , the gun violence archive — and then examine it against some of the other major sources of data we have mentioned above . <PARA> the meme makes four claims : that 154 mass shootings took place between 1 january and 28 june 2018 ; that black men didn ’ t perpetrate any of them ; that “ illegal aliens ” ( undocumented immigrants ) didn ’ t perpetrate any of them ; and that women didn ’ t perpetrate any of them . ( a spreadsheet containing our analysis can be downloaded here .) <PARA> gun violence archive <PARA> we downloaded the gun violence archive ’ s mass shootings database after the 28 june attack at the capital gazette newspaper in annapolis , maryland , and thoroughly analyzed each incident , using news reports , police statements , and court and prison records to attempt to verify the race , gender , and immigration status of suspected perpetrators in every case . this is what we found . <PARA> the gun violence archive defines a mass shooting as an occurrence in which four or more people ( not including the attacker ) are shot in a single incident , and they charted 153 such shootings occurring between 1 january and 28 june 2018 . using their definition and data , we find that : <PARA> no cases of mass shootings taking place in 2018 through 28 june had yet resulted in any convictions as of 9 july 2018 , so definitive identifications of mass shooting perpetrators ( along with their race , gender , or immigration status ) cannot yet be made . however , it is quite likely that at least some of the suspects so far charged with involvement in mass shootings will eventually be convicted , so it is also quite likely that at least some of the crimes defined by the gun violence archive as mass shootings will prove to have been perpetrated by black men , contrary to the meme ’ s claim . <PARA> in fact , the trend is highly likely to be the opposite of that presented by occupy democrats , at least as far as the gun violence archive data is concerned . of the 59 named individuals suspected of involvement in mass shootings , two - thirds ( 40 ) were black men . furthermore , many of the cases in which a suspect hadn ’ t yet been identified or charged involved gang - related shootings taking place in predominantly black communities , with exclusively black victims . <PARA> violent crime , including gun crime , is highly racially linked in the united states . according to department of justice research , an estimated 83 percent of violent gun crimes involving black victims between 2012 and 2015 were perpetrated by black assailants . so it would be statistically unlikely that many of the remaining 102 mass shootings involving black victims did not also involve black perpetrators . <PARA> although we did not find any evidence that an undocumented immigrant was involved in any mass shooting , it is important to note that police statements , arrest warrants , criminal complaints , and prison records do not routinely specify a suspect ’ s immigration status in the same way that they routinely specify the gender , race / ethnicity , and physical characteristics of a suspect . <PARA> we checked multiple news releases published by the immigration and customs enforcement agency ( ice ) but did not find any instances in which an undocumented immigrant was suspected of or charged with involvement in an attack that would match the gun violence archive ’ s definition of a mass shooting . <PARA> in one case , an undocumented immigrant named arnoldo pompa - rascon was charged in relation to a series of three non - fatal shootings on the same day in kansas city , missouri . however , that case would not qualify as a mass shooting under the gun violence archive ’ s definition because it involved fewer than four victims , and the shootings did not take place in “ one incident .” <PARA> similarly , the high - profile shooting at youtube ’ s san bruno , california , campus in april 2018 was perpetrated by a woman , nasim najafi aghdam , but because she shot three people ( i . e ., fewer than four ) before taking her own life , this incident was not counted by the gun violence archive . <PARA> mother jones <PARA> this source defines mass shootings as “ indiscriminate rampages in public places resulting in four or more victims killed by the attacker ,” and using their definition and data we find : <PARA> mass shooting tracker <PARA> this source defines mass shootings as incidents in which four or more people — potentially including the attacker — are shot ( but not necessarily killed ) in a single spree , and using their definition and data we find : <PARA> the major difference in definitions between the gun violence archive and the mass shooting tracker is clearly ( and tragically ) borne out in the widely differing lists of incidents . both sources have a numerical threshold of four victims , but only the mass shooting tracker includes shooters themselves as victims , resulting in many entries in that source ’ s database which don ’ t appear in others . <PARA> this trend was particularly prevalent among white suspects . of the 30 white shooting suspects ( male and female ), more than half ( 16 ) took their own lives . all but one of those 16 suicides came after a suspect first killed at least one family member . <PARA> we found no evidence of an undocumented immigrant ’ s having been directly involved in any of the incidents recorded by the mass shooting tracker , but it should be again noted again that a suspect ’ s immigration status is not routinely published in police statements , jail records , or court documents . <PARA> conclusion <PARA> how a mass shooting is defined has a significant bearing on the statistics we often see on television and read about in the news . too often , those nuanced distinctions and varying methodologies are not made clear . <PARA> the occupy democrats meme , like much social media commentary on gun violence , does not serve the public well in presenting a full and accurate picture of the facts . the source it relied upon for the figure of 154 mass shootings , the gun violence archive , includes 102 incidents in which the demographic profiles of the suspects are uncertain , so in most cases we can ’ t glean anything definitive about the race , gender or immigration status of mass shooting perpetrators . nonetheless , in those cases where suspects were identified , two - thirds of them were black men , a fact that significantly undermines the credibility of the meme . <PARA> when we widen the definition to include shooters themselves as victims ( as the mass shooting tracker does ), we observe a pattern of murder - suicides and family annihilations not represented in other sources — one which includes five female suspects ( and little doubt among investigators about their culpability ). and once again , black men represented a majority ( 58 ) of the 97 named suspects in the cases listed by the mass shooting tracker . these two facts also significantly undermine the credibility of the occupy democrats meme . <PARA> when we consulted the mother jones database , a source that strips away non - fatal , non - public , and gang - related mass shootings , we are left with only six incidents between 1 january and 28 june 2018 . in five of those , the suspect was a white man , and in the remaining case the suspect was an asian - american man . the absence of black , immigrant and female perpetrators from this list speaks in favor of the meme , but the total number of incidents ( six ) means it has little relevance to the 154 mass shootings mentioned by occupy democrats .

false	the reputation of the fourth estate has waxed and waned over the course of american ’ s history , sometimes thanks to the criticisms of public figures — including members of the press itself — complaining of its shortcomings and , according to them , undue influence on the electorate . <PARA> novelist , humorist , and sometime newspaperman mark twain is an example of a journalist who displayed sharply mixed feelings about the profession . on the one hand , he was of the firm opinion that the press — particularly the rambunctious , freewheeling american press of the late nineteenth century — was essential to the defense of a free society . <PARA> “ the devil ’ s aversion to holy water is a light matter compared with a despot ’ s dread of a newspaper that laughs ,” twain wrote in his 1888 essay , “ the american press .” <PARA> at the same time , he warned of the excesses of the press and their deleterious effect on ordinary people . “ there are laws to protect the freedom of the press ’ s speech , but none that are worth anything to protect the people from the press ,” he said in an 1873 speech . <PARA> in an even stronger statement that has been making the internet rounds since the early 2000s , twain allegedly urges readers to “ fear the media ”: <PARA> in a longer version of the quote , twain supposedly goes on to deride journalists as “ ignorant , self - complacent simpletons ”: <PARA> what we found when we attempted to source the quote , however , is that there is no public record of mark twain ever writing or uttering the words “ fear the media .” in fact , there is no evidence that he ever used the phrase “ the media ” in the sense we ’ re familiar with today ( i . e ., denoting means of mass communication ) — which would have been an anachronism , in any case . <PARA> when twain was writing and speaking ( in the late nineteenth and very early twentieth centuries ), there was only one form of mass communication — the printed word , in the form of books , pamphlets , magazines , and newspapers — and that ’ s how he referred to them . twain died in 1910 . no one would speak of “ the media ,” as we now understand the term , until the 1920s , at the earliest . <PARA> media historian john nerone ( author of the media and public life : a history , published in 2015 ) writes : <PARA> we therefore cannot credit mark twain with the exhortation , “ fear the media , for they will take your honor .” <PARA> who did say it ? we don ’ t know . the earliest instances of the quote we ’ ve found go back to 2003 , when it first turned up on the internet , sometimes attributed to mark twain , sometimes to “ unknown .” we suspect it was fabricated . <PARA> the longer version of the quote does contain sentences uttered by twain during a speech entitled “ license of the press ,” delivered in hartford , connecticut in march 1873 . it was the same speech in which he bemoaned the fact that there are laws protecting freedom of the press , but none protecting people from the press . his criticism of the journalistic profession ( of which he himself was a member ) was unsparing : <PARA> yet he delivered this condemnation with a wink and a nod . as we noted above , twain had mixed feelings about journalism . amply expressed in his closing statement :	
unproven	in late june 2018 , a number of media sources relayed a warning from the city of buckeye ( arizona ) fire department to the effect that residents should watch for rattlesnakes hiding in pool noodles ( long , cylindrical pool toys , usually hollow , made of polyethylene foam ). <PARA> according to usa today , the warning — which was issued on facebook — was based on a report the fire department received from a local resident : <PARA> the facebook alert was posted on 23 june 2018 , and was later edited to clarify a confusing statement suggesting that rattlesnake eggs had been found in a pool noodle ( rattlesnakes don ’ t lay eggs ): <PARA> it was unclear whether the entire post was written by someone at the fire department , however , or parts of it were simply copied from the message passed along to them . it was also unclear whether firefighters had personally investigated and verified the details of the incident . ( we reached out to the city of buckeye fire department for clarification on these points but did not hear back by publication time .) <PARA> rattlesnake experts interviewed by various news venues seemed to find it plausible that rattlesnakes would seek refuge from extremely hot weather inside pool noodles , though none cited specific instances of it having occurred before . <PARA> there is evidence that other kinds of snakes have been found in or near pool noodles , including a photo posted on the fire department ’ s facebook page showing what appears to be a harmless water snake under one of the pool toys : <PARA> we also found a youtube video uploaded in may 2018 , which shows a snake ( though it does not appear to be a rattler ) being shaken out of a pool noodle : <PARA> hughes ’ s safety suggestions included storing pool toys well off the ground or in a box , and installing snake fencing to keep snakes away from the pool in general . we asked hughes how worried people ought to be , realistically , about encountering rattlesnakes in their pool noodles . he told us :

true	in the summer of 2018 , the “ zero - tolerance ” immigration policy implemented by the administration of president donald trump and attorney general jeff sessions had far - reaching political and social consequences . <PARA> the policy — which has caused thousands of migrant parents to be separated from their children , often in uncertain and difficult circumstances — has prompted intense scrutiny and criticism , including from religious leaders up to pope francis . this religious opposition stepped up in june 2018 , when sessions invoked a biblical verse to justify the policy , romans 13 : <PARA> on 19 june , reports emerged that members of the united methodist church ( to which sessions belongs ) had initiated quasi - judicial proceedings against him , including charges of child abuse : <PARA> these reports are accurate . on 18 june 2018 , some 640 united methodist church members and leaders signed their names to an open letter addressed to rev . sterling boykin , a pastor at sessions ’ s home church in mobile , alabama , and rev . tracy wines , a pastor at the arlington , virginia umc congregation where sessions regularly attends . the letter read : <PARA> the signatories , led by rev . david wright , a umc pastor from washington state , wrote that they hoped to avoid a trial against sessions in the church ’ s courts system , preferring instead a less formal “ reconciling process .” nonetheless , the group leveled four separate charges against the united states attorney general : <PARA> under umc rules , any member can bring a complaint against any other member based on their conduct , or an alleged violation of the church ’ s book of discipline . typically , efforts are made to de - escalate grievances via mediation by church leaders and measures such as “ supervision ” or “ just resolution .” however , occasionally complaints can reach the umc ’ s judicial council , and pastors can be suspended or removed from their positions . <PARA> in 2005 , the judicial council caused controversy by handing down a series of rulings which excluded the lgbtq community from participation in the church . the council defrocked a philadelphia - based umc minister on the grounds that she had publicly declared herself a lesbian and openly carried out a relationship with another woman , and it upheld the right of a pastor in south hill , virginia to prevent an openly gay man from joining his congregation . <PARA> according to rev . william lawrence , a theologian , umc elder and professor emeritus of american church history at southern methodist university in dallas , texas , it would be unprecedented for formal charges against a lay member ( as opposed to a pastor ) to escalate to the level of a church trial , rather than being resolved with mediation at the local or regional level . lawrence told united methodist news : <PARA> we asked rev . tracy wines and rev . sterling boykin — sessions ’ s pastors and the addressees of the open letter — for their response to the charges , as well as their views on the attorney general ’ s “ zero - tolerance ” immigration policy and the separation of children from their parents . we did not receive a response from either pastor , in time for publication . <PARA> however , a spokesperson for the alabama - west florida conference , in which the attorney general ’ s home church is located , directed us to a statement issued on 18 june by the conference ’ s bishop david graves , who wrote : <PARA> the 18 june complaint letter is arguably the most significant public umc criticism to date of sessions ’ s immigration policy and the separation of children from their parents , but it is not the first time the attorney general ’ s co - religionists have voiced their opposition . <PARA> on 15 june , rev . dr . susan henry - crowe , who is the general secretary of the umc ’ s general board of church and society and a senior national official in the church , described the zero - tolerance immigration policy in scathing terms , calling sessions ’ s biblical defense a “ shocking violation of the spirit of the gospel ”: <PARA> she added : “ christian sacred texts should never be used to justify policies that oppress or harm children and families ” and urged umc members to contact sessions ’ s department of justice directly to register their opposition to the policy , pointedly referring to him as “ our fellow united methodist .” <PARA> former first lady laura bush ( a prominent umc member along with her husband , former president george w . bush ) condemned sessions ’ s policy as “ cruel ” and “ immoral ” and likened it to the internment of people of japanese descent during world war ii , in a high - profile column in the washington post . <PARA> the bush family ’ s dallas , texas umc pastor , rev . paul rasmussen , had harsh words for sessions ’ invocation of the bible in defense of the immigration policy : <PARA> we asked the department of justice for sessions ’ s response to these criticisms , as well as the complaint letter signed by 640 of his fellow umc members and the charges brought against him , but we did not receive a response in time for publication .	
true	on 15 june 2018 , incredibles 2 — the sequel to the hugely successful 2004 animated movie incredibles — was released to good reviews . not long after that , the reviews were augmented by concerns in widely shared blog posts and social media warnings that certain scenes might trigger epileptic seizures . <PARA> on 16 june , the non - profit epilepsy foundation issued a warning about the film : <PARA> according to the epilepsy foundation , around three percent of people with epilepsy have a condition known as photosensitive epilepsy , in which intense flickering lights and other visual stimuli can trigger seizures , migraines , and headaches . among the common causes of these seizures are “ intense strobe lights ,” “ video games or tv broadcasts containing rapid flashes or alternating patterns of different colors ,” and even natural sunlight , “ especially when shimmering off water , flickering through trees or through the slats of venetian blinds .” <PARA> over the course of the movie ’ s opening weekend , members of the public shared photographs of a boilerplate warning posted in movie theaters in various parts of the country by various companies including amc and cinemark : <PARA> film curator colin geddes shared what appears to be a memo sent by ken caldwell , senior vice president at walt disney studios motion pictures , to movie theaters showing incredibles 2 . the memo is dated 15 june 2018 , suggesting that disney took action on the epilepsy risk on the same day the movie was released : <PARA> you can find details here and here about the specific elements in the film that have caused most concern .	
mixture	gun violence and gun control have been the subject of renewed debate since the february 2018 shooting at marjory stoneman douglas high school in parkland , florida . <PARA> in particular , those in favor of enhanced regulation of gun ownership have focused on the ar - 15 semi - automatic rifle , which has been used in a number of high - profile mass shootings in recent years , including the massacre in parkland . in june 2018 , a dispute arose online over the physical impact and damage that can be caused by a bullet fired from an ar - 15 . <PARA> ] facebook user m . a . rothman posted two photographs side by side : one featured a poster which claimed to show “ the size of a hole used by an ar - 15 ,” and the other showed what rothman said was the true ( smaller ) dimensions of marks left by an ar - 15 rifle after target practice : <PARA> it ’ s not clear what are the precise origins of the photograph on the left , or where it was taken . the poster has become the subject of ridicule and anger among some gun rights advocates online , prompting parodies and responses such as this one , which was shared more than 50 , 000 times on facebook . <PARA> in brief , both sides in this dispute are right in some ways and wrong in others , and each photograph offers an incomplete examination of the kind of damage and impact that can be caused by gun shots . <PARA> at the heart of the issue is the question of what is meant by the “ hole made by an ar - 15 .” there are basically three possibilities : the entrance wound , the exit wound , and the cavity caused by a bullet as travels through a person ’ s body . there are no graphic images in this article , but we do at times get into descriptions of the damage caused by gun shots that some readers might find upsetting . <PARA> the entrance wound <PARA> the “ black hole ” shown in the poster is vastly too large to represent an ar - 15 entrance wound . jay wachtel , a retired police sergeant and special agent in the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , and firearms , and a former criminal justice lecturer at california state university , summed it up in an e - mail : “ the entrance wound for any firearm projectile is essentially the bullet diameter .” <PARA> typically , ar - 15 rifles are loaded with . 223 remington cartridges , which are housed in bullets with a diameter of 5 . 7 millimetres . so a round fired correctly from a functioning ar - 15 should create an entrance wound ( or target practice marking ) just under a quarter - inch in diameter . <PARA> this can be seen in many ar - 15 target practice videos and photographs available online , and is accurately reflected in the photograph posted by rothman on facebook . <PARA> the internal cavity <PARA> a bullet causes its most significant damage inside a person ’ s body , destroying the blood vessels , tissue and bone in its immediate path (“ permanent cavitation “), but also creating a kind of shockwave outwards into the tissue that surrounds this path . this is known as “ temporary cavitation ,” and when a bullet travels at higher velocity , the damage caused by this type of cavitation becomes exponentially greater , because the surrounding tissue struggles to absorb the kinetic energy given off by a bullet traveling at a higher velocity . <PARA> the design of bullets also has a bearing on temporary cavitation ( for example , hollow point rounds ), but high velocity is a major reason why rifles such as the ar - 15 can wreak such catastrophic damage to internal organs , and cause fatal bleeding . this mechanism is explained by the ammunition manufacturer hornady : <PARA> heather sher , a fort lauderdale - based radiologist who examined ct scans from some of the victims of the february 2018 parkland school shooting , wrote about the effects of ar - 15 rounds for the atlantic : <PARA> the “ hole ” illustrated in the poster could plausibly represent the diameter of the temporary cavitation left behind by an ar - 15 rifle round traveling through the human body . that is to say , the tract of potentially catastrophic damage done to blood vessels and tissue could be as tall and wide as the “ hole ” shown in the poster . <PARA> the exit wound <PARA> the black hole illustrated on the poster is unlikely to be representative of the size of an ar - 15 exit wound — but it is possible . while entrance wounds typically have the same dimensions as the bullet that causes them , the size and shape of exit wounds can vary more . <PARA> dr . sydney vail is a trauma surgeon with the maricopa integrated health system in phoenix , arizona , and is an expert in treating gunshot trauma . he explained to us some of the factors that determine the dimensions of exit wounds : <PARA> dr . judy melinek , a forensic pathologist from san francisco , california , explained to us the circumstances in which an ar - 15 might leave behind an unusually large exit wound . by email , she told us : <PARA> in her assessment , an exit wound the size of the “ black hole ” shown in the poster could potentially be caused by an ar - 15 round , but it is not likely , and certainly not typical . melinek told us that in her experience , ar - 15 rounds can completely fragment in the body and may not exit at all . <PARA> michael knox is a florida - based forensic consultant who conducts ballistics testing and crime scene reconstructions , and is regularly called upon to give expert testimony in criminal trials . his assessment of the “ black hole ” on the poster was blunt . by e - mail , he told us : “ the exit hole from an ar - 15 round would not be that big .” <PARA> conclusion <PARA> the photographs shown in the viral facebook post are a useful conversation - starter , but comparing them doesn ’ t serve readers well as an explanation of the physical impact of gun shots in general , or high - velocity ar - 15 rounds in particular . <PARA> based on the assessments shared with us by the experts we consulted — a forensic pathologist , a trauma surgeon , a former federal agent and criminal justice lecturer , and a forensic consultant and ballistics expert — we can say that the entrance wound from an ar - 15 round could not be anywhere near that large ; however , the tract of catastrophic damage torn through a person ’ s internal blood vessels , tissue , and bone by a high - velocity ar - 15 round could plausibly have around the same diameter as the “ black hole ” in the poster . <PARA> finally , it is unlikely that an ar - 15 exit wound would have the same dimensions as the “ black hole ” shown in the poster , but it is possible . the bullet would have to travel through the body in such a way that it fragmented bone and tissue to the extent that all that matter was forced out of the body along with the bullet itself , creating an exceptionally large exit wound .	
false	on 12 june 2018 , the same day president donald trump and north korea ’ s chairman kim jong un met for an historic summit in singapore , social media erupted with reports that a brand - new trump tower hotel had already opened in pyongyang , the north korean capital : <PARA> nearly all the posts link back to an article titled “ trump tower opens in pyongyang ” on a web site called duffel blog , described in its masthead as “ the american military ’ s most - trusted news source .” the article said the trump - branded enterprise had been hastily ensconced in an existing , never - completed hotel building : <PARA> but although the ill - fated ryugyong hotel does exist in downtown pyongyang ( and is popularly known outside north korea as the “ hotel of doom “), there have been no mainstream news reports of its being rebranded as a trump property , nor any evidence that the president issued a public statement praising the hotel ’ s tacos . <PARA> in point of fact , the article is an obvious spoof on the aggrandizing hype surrounding the trump / kim summit , not least trump ’ s own claim that he enticed kim jong un to give up nuclear missile testing by promising that north korea could have “ the best hotels in the world ” instead . <PARA> as explained in a disclaimer on the site , duffel blog ’ s stock - in - trade is social and political satire : <PARA> even before the duffel blog article appeared , jokes and memes predicting or announcing the construction of a trump tower in pyongyang were getting significant social media play : <PARA> no actual plans to erect a trump - branded hotel in north korea have been announced ... yet .	
false	in mid - june 2018 , we received several e - mails asking whether attorney general jeff sessions said , “ if we inflict fear and pain on children , adults won ’ t want to come here ”: <PARA> the questions were not accompanied by any links , images , or other information about the origin of the quote . one facebook post with a few thousand shares included the same wording attributed to sessions , but again without any corroboration : <PARA> news items about sessions ’ comments on border policy often included a statement he made at a gathering for the association of state criminal investigative agencies in arizona on 7 may 2018 : <PARA> in other articles , sessions was quoted as saying on the same date : <PARA> on 5 june 2018 , cbs news covered an interview sessions provided to radio host hugh hewitt . during the broadcast , hewitt asked sessions if it was “ absolutely necessary ... to separate parents from children when they are detained or apprehended at the border .” several responses from sessions were included in the article : <PARA> cbs also reported that sessions said while it is not the trump administration ’ s goal to separate children and families , “ he stated that ‘ it ’ s legitimate to warn people ’ that coming to the united states illegally may result in split families .” sessions ’ 7 may 2018 remarks continued appearing in news items more than a month later . <PARA> on 3 june 2018 , oregon senator jeff merkley visited a detention center in brownsville , texas and streamed it to facebook : <PARA> at roughly the 3 : 10 mark , sen . merkley said : <PARA> the specific quote widely attributed to sessions in june 2018 (“ if we inflict fear and pain on children , adults won ’ t want to come here ”) appeared to conflate attorney general sessions ’ repeated stance on family separation with sen . merkley ’ s characterization of those policies in a widely - shared 3 june 2018 video . however , sessions himself did not appear to say specifically that if “ we inflict fear and pain on children ” that “ adults won ’ t want to come here .”

mixture	odd new inventions and commercial products are a frequent source of attention - grabbing news headlines , especially if they stretch credibility . that was the case in 2017 , when news outlets around the world reported on jiftip , an adhesive band designed to offer men an alternative to condoms during sex . <PARA> in august 2017 , inked published an article with the headline “ teens seal their penis holes closed to avoid using condoms !” at some point after this , probably thanks to the headline of the inked article , the rumor mutated from an adhesive product into do - it - yourself territory , prompting a flurry of concerned e - mails to us : <PARA> in august 2016 , the hong kong - registered sumina global limited registered “ jiftip ” as a trademark in the united states . some 18 months earlier , a businessman named momo sumina — whose linkedin profile lists him as sumina global ’ s marketing director — applied for a united states patent for “ seminal and urinary fluid emission arresting devices , systems , and methods of using the same .” <PARA> this was a new version of his 2014 application for an invention that sumina billed as “ urethra shield — alternative to the male condom ”: <PARA> in the 2016 patent application , sumina wrote : <PARA> united states patent office records suggest that the patent application has not been granted as of june 2018 . in 2017 , sumina global posted a short instructional video on how the adhesive device is purported to work : <PARA> the jiftip web site features a shopping cart , where users can — at least in theory — purchase three jiftip strips for $ 9 , or ten for $ 24 . before completing an order , customers must agree to the following terms and conditions : <PARA> while the web site now features repeated emphatic disclaimers about the safety ( or otherwise ) of using jiftip ( calling it a “ backup for your pullout ”) the makers of the product previously made bold claims about the safety of using the adhesive to have sex without a condom , variously promoting jiftip with the slogans “ bareback sex without the worry ” and “ feeling and freedom of raw sex is safe now .” <PARA> sumina , in his original 2014 patent application , billed his invention as an “ alternative to the male condom .” the jiftip web site now stresses the opposite : “ is jiftip a condom alternative ? no ! it ’ s a sexual pleasure enhancement device .” <PARA> the device certainly exists , as the detailed patent application and instructional videos make clear , and the online store embedded in the jiftip web site would also suggest that the product is for sale . however , we could find no evidence , beyond the web site itself , of anyone actually having bought a pack of the adhesives . <PARA> despite the fact that jiftip is such a novelty and has prompted global headlines and giggling coverage on countless radio talk shows , we were unable to find a single facebook or twitter post or photo by a member of the public who had decided to experiment with the widely - publicized product or signed up as a beta tester , nor have we found any product reviews written by journalists or published on consumer web sites . the product is not available for purchase on amazon , ebay , or google . <PARA> the jiftip web site itself features two comments from men who present themselves as having either used or ordered the product . we asked the makers of jiftip for some figures relating to sales and beta - testing signups , as well as possible plans for future retail marketing , but we did not receive a response in time for publication . <PARA> while jiftip does exist , the prevalence of its usage appears to have been greatly exaggerated in some news reports , and there is absolutely no evidence that “ teens ” are opting for it at all , much less at a higher rate than their older counterparts , which is probably a good thing .	
false	in june 2018 social media users began circulating a heart - rending photograph depicting a sobbing toddler clutching the bars of a cage in which he is confined , usually accompanied by commentary stating that the image depicted a boy who had been detained by u . s . immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) in 2018 and criticizing trump administration immigration policies as being responsible for the youngster ’ s plight : <PARA> some commenters maintained that the photograph had been taken years prior ( in 2014 or earlier ), during the administration of president barack obama , and was therefore not illustrative of the results of trump - era immigration policies . <PARA> however , as it turned out , the photograph was taken on 10 june 2018 , but it did not show a child confined by immigration authorities to a cage . rather , it was snapped during a protest staged in front of dallas city hall to call attention to the trump administration ’ s practice of separating families and confining undocumented children . different photographs of the event document that the same child was standing a mocked - up “ cage ” open at the top , and several commenters noted that the boy was crying not because he was confined , but because he saw his mother outside the pen and could not immediately figure out how to get to her . <PARA> the photograph was quickly decoupled from its source ( as happens quite often on the internet ), and then it was circulated with various descriptions and captions that left the mistaken impression the pictured boy was a child who had been caged by immigration authorities . <PARA> you can spot the youngster out of the cage in this photograph : <PARA> the full photoset can be viewed here .	
false	tales about animals exhibiting human ( or human - like ) behavior have long been the subject of myths and legends , and one form of this narrative especially resonates with modern readers : the notion that an animal would — like most human mothers — knowingly and willingly sacrifice her own life to protect her children . <PARA> many animals will of course engage in defensive posturing and even aggressively attack a much larger predator in order to defend their broods . but we seem especially drawn to accounts ( such as this one ) that posit a mother animal ’ s going beyond mere instinctive reaction and reasoning out ( and then engaging upon ) a course of action she knows will spell her end but will preserve the lives of her offspring . <PARA> one example of this type of narrative is the following account , which holds that a mother deer ( actually an impala ) deliberately allowed herself to be caught by cheetahs in order to allow her two fawns a chance to escape a similar fate : <PARA> the image seen here is one of a series of pictures ( titled “ the stranglehold ”) taken by photographer alison buttigieg in kenya in 2013 , documenting the capture of an impala by a group of cheetahs . but as alison explained in her backstory to the set of photographs , what she captured on camera was not a mother impala ’ s sacrificing herself to protect her offspring . in fact , the real story was nearly the inverse of that concept — these photographs show a mother cheetah attempting to teach her cubs how to kill prey , then eventually dispatching a captured impala when her inexperienced cubs proved they weren ’ t yet up to the task of strangling it themselves : <PARA> as alison noted , it ’ s unusual “ how calm the impala is throughout its ordeal ,” as well as how the doomed animal exhibited a seeming “ lack of interest in self - preservation ,” but those behaviors had nothing to do with an effort on the part of the impala to allow her fawns a chance to escape a similar fate . <PARA> other versions of this tale maintain that ms . buttigieg “ fell into depression ” after snapping the photograph , a claim she refuted in a statement to dna ( india ), as well as in her own facebook post :	
false	as much of the world grieved the death of tv celebrity and food writer anthony bourdain , the neon nettle fake news site shamelessly exploited the tragedy to push out yet another fabricated clickbait story about “ elite pedophile rings .” <PARA> a 9 june 2018 neon nettle article headlined “ anthony bourdain was about to expose an elite pedophile ring before he died ” stated the following : <PARA> however , the text of the article was a typical neon nettle disjointed word salad that provided absolutely no substantiation or documentation for their assertion that bourdain was “ about to expose an elite pedophile ring .” the sum total of the case presented by neon nettle was a pair of out - of - context tweets from bourdain , which neon nettle attempted to spin as evidence of some undefined conspiracy involving hillary clinton and harvey weinstein : <PARA> certainly bourdain had openly criticized hillary clinton ’ s response when film producer harvey weinstein — a longtime clinton donor — was accused of sexually assaulting and harassing dozens of women , including bourdain ’ s girlfriend , asia argento . bourdain expressed incredulity that clinton could have been unaware of weinstein ’ s sexual misbehavior , but the weinstein scandal had nothing to do with a child sex trafficking sting later conducted in the atlanta area , to which neon nettle bizarrely attempted to link it . <PARA> neon nettle ’ s tortured logic seemed to be that bourdain ’ s parts unknown program aired on cnn , and cnn is headquartered in atlanta , where a child sex - trafficking ring was recently busted , so ... something . the bottom line is that absolutely nothing suggests anthony bourdain knew about , much less was planning to expose , any “ elite pedophile ring .” <PARA> neon nettle also tossed an abundance of obfuscatory false and misleading statements into their word salad to deflect from the article ’ s complete lack of substance : <PARA> o although mr . bourdain ’ s death has been officially declared a suicide , many see his untimely passing a suspicious and unexpected . <PARA> bourdain ’ s death may have been unexpected to many , but that it was the result of a suicide is not rationally disputed . <PARA> o it ’ s no secret that people who cross the clintons ’ path end up dead ... usually from suicide . <PARA> this statement is nothing more than a rehash of rumors we first debunked here over twenty years ago . and it ’ s irrelevant , as bourdain plainly expressed that he didn ’ t believe hillary clinton was in any way responsible for harvey weinstein ’ s crimes : <PARA> o just this week , famous designer and clinton foundation member , kate spade reportedly killed herself . according to spade ’ s family , she had also been threatened for speaking out . <PARA> again , there is no “ reportedly ” to designer kate spade ’ s death by suicide . and what spade ’ s sister maintained she was “ threatened ” over was speaking out about her sibling ’ s mental illness , not anything remotely related to child sex trafficking or “ pedophile rings .” <PARA> o more recently , following news of a major child trafficking bust , sources are stating that bourdain was planning on running “ an exposé ” and the sex slave network . <PARA> we found zero evidence of any “ source ” — outside of disreputable neon nettle itself — stating that bourdain had plans to run a “ sex slave network exposé ” on his travel and food show . ( naturally , neon nettle neither identified nor linked to a any such “ source .”) <PARA> o despite reports that 160 children were rescued and will almost 150 arrested during the raids [ in atlanta ], mr . bourdain ’ s network , cnn , has refused to cover the case . even more bizarrely , suspicious “ fact - checking ” website snopes even went as far as to debunk reports that the raids even took place . <PARA> this statement was completely and utterly untrue . we debunked false reports that a so - called ‘ child trafficking bunker ’ had been discovered near tucson ( it was actually an abandoned homeless encampment ); we wrote nothing about the completely unrelated operation safe summer raids conducted by the fbi ’ s atlanta field office . <PARA> o a group of retired veterans uncovered child trafficking camp in the tucson , arizona . after accidentally stumbling upon the “ pedophile bunker ” whilst looking for homeless vets , they found children ’ s toys , pornography , and even a human skull believed to belong to a child aged 7 - 8 . <PARA> again , not only is the tucson “ pedophile bunker ” claim false , but the related rumor that a child ’ s skull ” was found at the site is untrue as well . ( the skull was that of an adult , not a child , and it was found in a remote area more than twenty miles northwest of tucson , not at the site of the supposed “ pedophile bunker .”) <PARA> all of this misreporting was par for the course for neon nettle , a notorious fake news site with a predilection for publishing sensationalized and exaggerated ( if not completely fabricated ) stories about pedophiles . true to form , neon nettle added multiple false elements to this particular report to enhance its luridness .	
false	while 2018 saw the advancement of conspiracy theories about “ child trafficking rings ,” at least one blog expressly devoted to such stories saw fit to regurgitate an equally dubious post smearing pope francis from four years earlier . <PARA> specifically , a 28 january 2018 post on the blog “ the pedogate ” — named after an offshoot of the completely debunked “ pizzagate ” conspiracy theory — stated that the pope was among three defendants found guilty “ yesterday ” of child trafficking and murder , among other grisly crimes , by the “ international common law court of justice ”: <PARA> the “ court ” is actually a one - person blog which also stated , falsely , that the pope had resigned . meaning that the story is a fabrication — no less of a fabrication than the version published by the same author in july 2014 on yet another shoddy blog : <PARA> despite lacking any tangible proof , outlandish stories pushing claims of global pedophilia rings continue to circulate online ; besides “ pizzagate ” and “ pedogate ,” another iteration centers around the debunked claim that a trafficking “ bunker ” had been found in arizona .	
true	venturing predictions of large - scale socioeconomic trends is part and parcel of what economists do , so for members of that august profession the odds are fairly high that now and again one will be required to eat one ’ s own words . <PARA> sometimes those words will even be served back to one on a silver platter , as in the case of nobel prize - winning economist paul krugman , who thanks to the internet , will probably never live down a prediction he allegedly once made about the internet . the quote is so infamous , in fact , that it has turned into a meme often wielded against him by people hoping to discredit other pronouncements krugman has made : <PARA> it has also made the rounds in a slightly longer version : <PARA> the prediction was wildly inaccurate in either form , obviously . internet growth has done nothing but boom since the late 1990s . and although the fax machine was a crucial innovation that increased the speed and affordability of inter - office communications everywhere , the economic effects of the internet — which has come to play a central role in virtually every aspect of life in every developed country — have been nothing short of transformative . <PARA> “ as of this writing , the market capitalization of google , amazon , and facebook alone is more than $ 700 billion , which is more than the gdp of all but eighteen countries ,” observed freakonomics authors steven d . levitt , stephen j . dubner in a 2014 takedown of krugman ’ s prediction . “ if you throw in apple , which isn ’ t an internet company but couldn ’ t exist without it , the market cap is $ 1 . 2 trillion . that could buy a lot of fax machines .” <PARA> that krugman wrote the passage isn ’ t under dispute , so much as where and when he wrote it . in an e - mail to business insider in 2013 , krugman said it was part of a piece he contributed to new york times magazine in 1998 : <PARA> the magazine celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1996 , not 1998 , however , and although krugman did write a piece for the 29 september 1996 edition that matches the above description , it did not contain a passage contrasting the effect of the internet to that of the fax machine . <PARA> levitt and dubner correctly cited an article by krugman in the 10 june 1998 issue of red herring magazine as the actual source of the quote : <PARA> when we asked krugman about the confusion over the provenance of the quote , he said he couldn ’ t remember writing the red herring article , but he didn ’ t shy from admitting his mistake :	
false	in june 2018 , the fundamental differences between pardons and commutations appear to have been lost on a meme creator who produced a graphic presenting the claim that president obama “ pardoned ” more than 1 , 700 criminals during his term , and that more than 330 of those pardons were granted during his final week in office : <PARA> some versions of this meme carried a watermark for right - wing youth activist group turning point usa ( tpusa ), but we were unable to find any instances of this particular group ’ s sharing the meme . although we aren ’ t certain if tpusa was responsible for the creation of the meme ( several examples of this image , such as the one shown above , do not contain a watermark ) the group ’ s founder , charlie kirk , has repeated at least one of its claims on twitter : <PARA> the meme , much like kirk , confused pardons with commutations . the u . s . constitution grants the president of the united states the executive power of clemency in article ii , section 2 . this power can be expressed via a commutation , which reduces prison sentences but does not reverse convictions or expunge criminal records , or a pardon , which fully absolves a person of guilt for a criminal offense . <PARA> the u . s . justice department ( doj ) explained the difference between pardons and commutations thusly : <PARA> for instance , when president obama commuted the sentence of chelsea manning on 17 january 2017 , reducing a 35 - year prison sentence to about seven years , that did not change manning ’ s status as a felon convicted by court - martial for violations of the espionage act . <PARA> the numbers presented in the meme appear to be inaccurate as well . clemency statistics compiled by the doj show that president obama commuted 1 , 715 prison sentences during his time in office and also issued 212 pardons : <PARA> president obama did employ his power of clemency for 330 federal inmates during his final week in office , but again his actions produced sentence commutations , not pardons , as was reported at the time : <PARA> president barack obama did grant more commutations than any other president in u . s . history to date . however , given that he also received a record number of clemency petitions , his clemency rate was comparatively low : <PARA> although president obama set a record for the most commutations in history , his total of 212 pardons was well below that of many of his predecessors . bill clinton issued 396 pardons , ronald reagan 393 , and the all - time record goes to franklin delano roosevelt , who issued 2 , 819 pardons during his 12 years ( not 16 ) in office . george h . w . bush and george w . bush were the only presidents of the modern era who issued fewer pardons than barack obama .	
false	a graphic photograph of kidney stones circulating for years online has been used to push a purported tip for healthy living , but medical experts say that the image has , unsurprisingly , been misappropriated by people seeking attention and “ likes .” <PARA> one iteration of the photograph , which has been shared hundreds of thousands of times on facebook , pushes the claim that it “ belonged to someone who overindulged in energy drinks ” and tells other users , “ show this to folks that ’ s [ sic ] addicted ”: <PARA> according to the mayo clinic , kidney stones can stem from several different causes : “ kidney stones form when your urine contains more crystal - forming substances — such as calcium , oxalate and uric acid — than the fluid in your urine can dilute . at the same time , your urine may lack substances that prevent crystals from sticking together , creating an ideal environment for kidney stones to form .” <PARA> while most stones are composed of calcium oxalate , metabolic conditions such as high blood sugar , blood pressure , or elevated cholesterol levels can contribute to the development of another type of stone , calcium phosphate . <PARA> simon conti , an assistant professor of urology at stanford university , told us that the condition seen in the photograph could be metabolic in nature . however , he said , while the photograph does depict kidney stones , to blame it solely on heavy soda or energy drink consumption is taking it out of context . “ more likely this person had an obstruction of some sort and the stones filled that area up ,” conti told us . <PARA> in 2014 , the american college of physicians advised the public to increase their daily water intake in order to help prevent stones from forming , citing a study that determined that kidney stone patients who drank less sodas containing phosphoric acid cut their risk of developing more stones by about 15 percent . <PARA> but while sugar content and the possible risk of diabetes are viable issues with heavy soda consumption , conti said , to solely blame soft drinks and energy drinks for suffering from kidney stones is dishonest . <PARA> “ there is a series of events that one could imagine from drinking too many energy drinks that could lead eventually to this ,” he said . “ but for your average person drinking colas or energy drinks there ’ s going to be other problems before this sort of thing happens . this is a very far gone kidney that had a lot of problems before it got to this point .”	
false	on 3 june 2018 , multiple web sites falsely reported that it is now “ against the law ” for californians to shower and do laundry on the same day , thanks to supposedly draconian water conservation legislation signed into law by governor jerry brown . <PARA> for example , the conspiratorial web site zerohedge reported that : <PARA> the bills in question , senate bill 606 and assembly bill 1668 , were indeed signed into law by governor brown on 31 may 2018 ( and brown has indeed reached his term limit as governor ). neither bill , however , carries language penalizing consumers for taking a shower and doing laundry on the same day . instead , they outline conservation mandates for water districts and municipalities , and water agencies can be fined if they fail to meet conservation goals ( but not until 2027 ). <PARA> overall , californians will have to use less water in a state that has been plagued by persistent droughts , and this is not a new concept to locals . residents had to slash water use during a historic five - year drought that ended in april 2017 . <PARA> jim metropulos , legislative director for california state assemblywoman laura friedman ( d - glendale ) who authored 1668 , told us the legislation sets water efficiency goals for water districts and municipalities on the territorial level , but it does not regulate what individual californians or businesses can and can ’ t do : “ there is nothing in this bill to target households or companies . water use objectives are on territory - level of a water agency . there is nothing regulating the time a person may shower or when they may or may not do laundry .” ( the “ penalty of up to $ 1 , 000 per day ” for excessive water use referenced in many alarmist articles on this subject applies to “ urban retail water suppliers ,” not to individual customers .) <PARA> the legislation instead will prompt water agencies to set methods and goals for reducing per capita water use over time , starting in 2022 . in a statement released by brown ’ s office , the governor said the legislation is meant to brace the state for the next water shortage : <PARA> according the san jose mercury news , water agencies can take steps such as incentivizing water conservation by encouraging customers to do away with thirsty lawns and installing drought - resistant landscaping : <PARA> given that the average shower uses about 17 . 2 gallons of water , while most high - efficiency clothes washers use only 15 to 30 gallons of water per load , most california residents ( depending upon their personal habits and the efficiency of their home appliances and water fixtures ) shouldn ’ t find it too difficult to accommodate a daily shower and a daily laundry load while staying within the 55 gallons per person per day guideline . but either way , nothing in either legislative bill specifically levies fines against customers who do laundry and shower on the same day .	
false	in late may 2018 , a parody message posted to the social media platform twitter purporting to have been authored by conservative commentator tomi lahren circulated online although it had initially been created in 2016 : <PARA> lahren is known for taking inflammatory positions on racial issues , such as comparing anti - police violence movement black lives matter to the ku klux klan and likening national football league players kneeling during the anthem in protest of police killings of unarmed black americans to “ pouting .” but she did not post the above tweet . <PARA> lahren infamously attacked beyoncé in december 2017 for presenting nfl player colin kaepernick with sports illustrated ’ s muhammad ali legacy award . lahren has an apparent obsession with the nfl protests which kaepernick launched in 2016 while he was a quarterback for the san francisco 49ers and goes on regular tirades about them . <PARA> her 5 december 2017 tweet calling the music icon “ police - hating ” and kaepernick “ america - hating ” incited the wrath of beyoncé ’ s ardent fans ( known as the “ beyhive ” for swarming on anyone who publicly attacks the singer ). as multiple web sites pointed out out at the time , the beyhive response to lahren ’ s tweet was swift and unrelenting . <PARA> the fake tweet above appeared a year before the authentic one caused a storm , and has fooled many since it was created . however a closer inspection of the account bearing lahren ’ s name and image from which it originated shows it is labeled a parody .

false	a video of a 2013 student protest in egypt is frequently attached to dubious claims about false flag attacks and civilians faking their deaths . in may 2018 , after dozens of palestinians were killed along the gaza border during protests following a ceremony marking the relocation of the united states embassy in israel to the city of jerusalem , that 2013 clip was shared on twitter as if it showed a group of palestinian martyrs staging their deaths : <PARA> this piece of propaganda was re - shared by far - right personalities such as paul joseph watson and ben shapiro , and radio host wayne dupree also hosted the video on his web site as part of an article titled “ at first glance you see palestinian martyrs until one needs to scratch his nose .” <PARA> this wasn ’ t the first time the same video ( which can be viewed at the bottom of this article ) had been shared out of context . in 2014 , for instance , the conservative post offered the video to readers , claiming that it depicted hamas staging an islamic funeral : <PARA> this video has also been shared as if it constituted “ evidence ” that the 2013 rabaa massacre had been staged , as if it showed crisis actors in the aftermath of a chemical attack in syria , and as if it were a piece of “ hamas propaganda ” depicting a group of muslims faking civilian deaths . <PARA> this footage , however , doesn ’ t capture anyone attempting to stage a mass casualty event . it actually shows a group of students at cairo ’ s al - azhar university taking part in a “ die - in ” protest and was originally shared on the youtube page of al badil , an egyptian news outlet : <PARA> al badil uploaded several other videos from this protest as well , such as the following : <PARA> an english - language report published by ahram in october 2013 provided more context about the protest : <PARA> to sum up : this video doesn ’ t show anyone ’ s getting “ caught ” faking their own deaths , but rather a “ die - in ” form of protest staged by students at egypt ’ s al - azhar university in 2013 .	
false	a series of misleading and exaggerated headlines over the span of several years turned a story about a woman ’ s painful dining experience into a rumor about getting pregnant from a squid — via mouth . <PARA> this turned into a battle of headlines as the facts . for example , an article published by the sun in 2012 read : “ woman ‘ pregnant ’ with 12 baby squid .” not to be outdone , the mirror reported that the south korean woman had become “ pregnant by squid ” and warned readers that they should “ be careful when putting seafood in your mouth ” because “ you could end up spitting out babies .” <PARA> stories about the squeam - inducing squid encounter have been published by a wide range of outlets over the years . most recently , this story was featured on an episode of weird wild world from the facebook page “ nameless . tv ”: <PARA> some truth underlies these stories , but associated headlines ( as well as some of the details ) are severely misleading or wholly inaccurate and have led some readers to believe that a woman was “ impregnated ” by a squid via her mouth . <PARA> the most misleading aspect of this rumor comes down to the words “ pregnant ” or “ impregnate .” although these words were frequently employed by outlets presumably hoping to generate clicks on their stories , they are inaccurate . the episode of weird wild world was actually referring to a case report originally published in pathology international in september 2011 : <PARA> this woman , who was identified as a 63 - year - old korean woman in a subsequent report in the journal of parasitology , ate a sperm bag while ingesting a piece of raw squid . as science 2 . 0 — one of the first web sites to pick up on this story when it first went viral in june 2012 — noted in their report about these rumors , there is a big difference between “ inseminate ” and “ impregnate ”:\ <PARA> exaggerated reports went one step further , claiming that the unfortunate woman had “ squid babies ” removed from where they had become embedded in her mouth : “ a 63 - year - old woman has become ‘ pregnant ’ with 12 baby squid after eating calamari .” <PARA> this is another severe exaggeration . doctors removed squid spermatophores , a capsule containing the squid sperm , from this woman ’ s mouth . for a number of scientific reasons ( a human woman ’ s mouth is not the same as a female squid egg ), these sperms never developed into baby squids . <PARA> although the story is bizarre , it is not without precedent . several similar cases have been documented in various medical journals . a 2012 report in zoomorphology examines these cases and explains that spermatophore attachment is autonomous ( meaning it can occur without the aid of male or female squid ) making the consumption of raw male squid a potentially hazardous dining experience : <PARA> medical journals have documented several instances of people being stung by spermatophores after ingesting raw squid , but these reports , specifically an instance from 2011 , were grossly misrepresented with clickbait headlines .

mixture	in the red corner , standing at six - foot - four ( excluding the stovetop hat ), with only one defeat in 300 matches , the reigning champion of new salem county , and a future member of the national wrestling hall of fame ... ladies and gentlemen , we give you the great emancipator ! <PARA> by all accounts , abraham lincoln — yes , the sixteenth president of the united states — was indeed a skilled and accomplished wrestler . however , as with any good story , tales of his prowess in the ring have been exaggerated over the years — and never more so than in the internet age . <PARA> several rumors are regularly shared in a popular meme that features a rendering of lincoln with a championship belt draped across his shoulder : <PARA> another rumor is that lincoln was a regional champion at 21 : <PARA> there are a lot of moving parts behind lincoln ’ s wrestling history , let ’ s try to examine these claims one by one . <PARA> first up , the absurd artwork of lincoln with a championship belt : <PARA> although the image may give the impression that lincoln ’ s wrestling matches were comparable to the glitzy modern - day stage productions from groups like world wrestling entertainment , lincoln was a skilled wrestler — but he never hoisted a glamorous gold - encrusted belt , and he never strutted into a ring as fireworks went off behind him . <PARA> so where did this glamorous portrayal of the illinois railsplitter come from ? this is a composite of at least two different images and features a championship belt that belonged to wwe star randy orton : <PARA> did abraham lincoln win an illinois county wrestling championship in 1830 ? <PARA> this rumor appears to be based on a very loose translation of the word “ champion .” <PARA> one of the most famous stories about lincoln ’ s wrestling skills involves a match with a local tough named jack armstrong . although the details of this fight are hazy at best — some accounts claim that lincoln won , others that armstrong did , but only by cheating — this appears to be the match at the root of this rumor . <PARA> armstrong is referred to as the “ champion ” of his group of friends , the clary ’ s grove boys , in various accounts about this fight . however , this seems to be an informal title . armstrong was the toughest guy in town , the leader of his group , or , as john t . stuart , lincoln ’ s first law partner , described him , the “ champion of his clan .” <PARA> that is , until he went up against young lincoln : <PARA> another version of this story can be found in the biography abraham lincoln : redeemer president : <PARA> here ’ s how david herbert donald described the fight in the biography lincoln : <PARA> the descriptions of armstrong as a champion are not actually referring to some official title , but instead that he was known as the toughest man in the area . so when lincoln defeated him — if he actually did — during their storied bout , he may have usurped the informal “ champion ” title in the area , but this was not done in any official capacity . <PARA> we reached out to researchers at the abraham lincoln presidential library foundation for more information ; they told us that lincoln was never an official county wrestling champion in illinois , but for a very good reason : “ county wrestling championships did not exist in illinois in the 1830s .” <PARA> was lincoln honored by the national wrestling hall of fame ? <PARA> a number of united states presidents have been honored by the national wrestling hall of fame . in 1992 , lincoln was given the organization ’ s “ outstanding american ” award : <PARA> the national wrestling hall of fame has also honored other “ presidential grapplers ” such as george washington , william howard taft , and teddy roosevelt . a mural of lincoln ’ s match with armstrong adorns one of the walls in the museum ’ s “ lincoln lobby “: <PARA> the national wrestling hall of fame is dedicated to athletes who practice a traditional version of the sport . although the image include in this meme might suggest that lincoln was a member of the wwe wrestling hall of fame , that is not the case . the nwhf and the wwe wrestling hall of fame are two distinct and separate organizations . <PARA> did lincoln lose only one of nearly 300 matches ? <PARA> there is no official record for all of lincoln ’ s wrestling matches , making it impossible to say how many he won , lost , or even participated in . as noted earlier , even the details about lincoln ’ s most famous bouts are unclear . <PARA> this rumor , however , is rooted in some truth . we know that lincoln frequently engaged in wrestling matches and that he was especially skilled at the sport . in fact , when lincoln was reminiscing about his wrestling days on the campaign trail in 1860 , he told risdon moore , a college professor whose father served with lincoln during the black hawk war , that he was undefeated until he was thrown by a man named lorenzo dow thompson : <PARA> lincoln ’ s wrestling history is a mixture of fact and folklore . although we don ’ t know if this was truly the only match he lost in hundreds of fights ( remember that some also claim he lost to armstrong ), we do know that the majority of accounts about lincoln ’ s wrestling matches end with lincoln as the victor . of course , this may have to do with the fact that many of these stories were retold as lincoln was running for president , and may therefore have been presented by that time in a far more favorable light . <PARA> did lincoln tell a crowd : “ i ’ m the big buck of this lick ”? <PARA> this quote comes from the biography “ abraham lincoln : the prairie years ,” which was written by poet and author carl sandburg in 1926 . lincoln reportedly said this phrase after a raucous battle with his stepbrother , john johnston , which was initiated by a man named william grigsby . as sandburg tells it , lincoln defeated johnston , went searching for grigsby in the crowd , threw the man into the middle of the ring , and then sparked an all out brawl when he issued this challenge to the crowd : <PARA> this is most likely not an exact quote from lincoln . as with most of the stories about abraham lincoln ’ s wrestling matches , however , it is rooted in truth .	
false	in september 2008 , hurricane ike made landfall in galveston , texas , the site of the deadliest hurricane in american history 108 years earlier , and caused multiple deaths and an estimated $ 30 billion in property damage throughout texas , louisiana , and florida . hundreds of thousands of people were forced to evacuate their homes before and during the storm . <PARA> according to the national hurricane center , the bolivar peninsula suffered the worst devastation and most destructive storm surges in the united states . that narrow stretch of land between galveston bay and the gulf of mexico was also the site of one of the iconic images to emerge in the aftermath of hurricane ike : the “ last house standing .” <PARA> associated press photographer david j . phillip took a series of photographs of the house that were captioned as picturing “ a beachfront home stand [ ing ] among the debris in gilchrist , texas on sunday , sept . 14 , 2008 after hurricane ike hit the area .” <PARA> another view of the same house was provided by the federal emergency management agency ( fema ): <PARA> over the intervening years , the remarkable image became the subject of a viral meme which claimed that supernatural forces , rather than pure chance , were to thank for the house ’ s escaping destruction . for example , in may 2018 , the “ scary facts ” facebook page shared this meme : <PARA> the beachfront home , which stood surrounded by debris from neighboring properties , belonged to then 53 - year - old cost analyst pam adams and her husband warren , a 63 - year - old retired electrical designer and u . s . marine veteran . <PARA> in 2005 , hurricane rita had destroyed the couple ’ s home in gilchrist , so they rebuilt a house on the same site . therefore , the claim made in the meme , that an exorcism in 1988 later saved the adamses ’ home , is false because the house didn ’ t exist until 2006 . <PARA> the real reason the house survived the hurricane was more prosaic . in a 2008 interview with the houston chronicle , warren adams suggested elevation played a key role : <PARA> although the structure remained standing , the interior did not survive unscathed , as cnn reported that “ everything was waterlogged and covered in mud . [ pam ] adams said they had to throw clothing , furniture and other destroyed possessions out their windows to stop mold from growing .” <PARA> for a time after the storm , the adamses resided in an apartment in baytown , texas , and seriously considered abandoning bolivar peninsula and moving on . but in the end , they stayed put and rebuilt the house again , along with some ( though not all ) of their neighbors . in a blog post , pam adams later explained the couple ’ s decision to stay : <PARA> the last house standing was inhabitable again within a year , and in 2010 pam adams even opened a bar and restaurant nearby called fantasea bbq & grill . ( warren adams died in 2016 at the age of 71 .) <PARA> the survival of the adams home amid the devastation hurricane ike caused on the bolivar peninsula was truly remarkable , and aerial photographs of it standing alone in the immediate aftermath of the storm have proven iconic . but an exorcism supposedly performed in 1988 , a full eighteen years before the house was built , had nothing to with any of it .

false	the cells within a human body are myriad , multi - functioned , and completely distinct from one another . different kinds of human cells replace themselves at different rates , which means the human body is comprised of cells of many different ages . <PARA> the vast majority of a these cells regenerate fairly rapidly , making most cells in a human body much younger than the age of the human itself . the researcher behind a groundbreaking study that attempted to date the ages of various cells in a human body , jonas frisen , famously estimated that the average age of a cell in the human body is between 7 and 10 years old in a pivotal 2005 paper published in cell . <PARA> these statements have led some to the conclusion that every cell in the human body is replaced every 7 to 10 years — a fun but inaccurate factoid commonly held as true . the central flaw in the argument is that an average of all the cells in a body masks the fact that some cells last very long times , and other cells don ’ t regenerate for a person ’ s entire lifetime , as described by npr : <PARA> using a method that allowed for radiocarbon analysis of individual types of cells , frisen and his colleagues quantified the age of intestinal cells , skeletal muscle cells , and the gray matter of two brain regions — the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum . compiling data from multiple individuals , they found : <PARA> as npr also noted , some other cells will also remain with you literally from embryo to death . the cells that make up the central core of the lens of an eye remain with a human from their genesis during embryonic development to their demise at death . <PARA> because of these outliers , there will never be a period of time over which one can accurately say that all of the cells in your body have been replaced by new ones ( even if a vast majority of them will have been replaced in that time period ). therefore , we rank the claim that a human ’ s body is replaced on the cellular level every seven years as false .

false	on 9 april 2018 , a number of tabloid - like news reports suggested that a russian woman had been “ embalmed alive ” after doctors mistakenly administered formalin intravenously instead of saline : <PARA> one of the first articles to appear reported that 28 - year - old ekaterina fedyaeva had been “ embalmed alive ”: <PARA> other news reports were light on details about the medical mishap , stating only that fedyaeva had been given “ formalin , a solution that contains formaldehyde — which is used to preserve dead bodies .” <PARA> an article from the russian news agency tacc ( translated ) clarified the chain of events , reporting that formalin had mistakenly been used instead of saline during a relatively routine removal of ovarian cysts : <PARA> the routine surgery took place on 15 march 2018 . early local reports contradicted the repeated claim that fedyaeva was placed on a “ formalin drip ,” stating that an “ unknown nurse ” washed the surgical site with formalin instead of saline . four days later , fedyaeva was transported to moscow where doctors worked to undo the damage caused by the administered formalin , but the patient succumbed to her injuries on 5 april 2018 . <PARA> ongoing accounts published by local news sources provide a relatively clear timeline . no formalin drip was substituted for saline , nor was the patient injected with formalin . initial english - language reports claimed fedyaeva had been “ given a drip normally infused into the veins of the dead to prevent decomposition ,” suggesting that the medical mishap amounted to an accidental embalming , but according to morticians that was not even close to the case . <PARA> in an assessment of the claims , mortician caleb wilde wrote that a “ slow , intravenous drip of formalin would have ripped apart the insides of ekaterina fedyaeva .” wilde repeated his skepticism that the story occurred in the manner reported , adding that “ formalin has a potent smell ... that burns when you breathe it in ... whoever put formalin in the iv bag ( and i don ’ t know the protocols for filling iv bags ) were either without a sense of smell , extremely dense , or they did it on purpose ”: <PARA> formalin or formaldehyde is extremely toxic and can easily be absorbed through the skin . <PARA> intravenous ( or iv ) fluids are used to infuse medications or fluids into the bloodstream of a living person . this process is effective for the living because of the process of circulation . as wilde notes , the procedures of embalming differ dramatically from those of iv administration . <PARA> although embalming fluid ( which is around five percent formaldehyde ) is eventually introduced via a completely different apparatus , that process takes place only after the cadaver is drained of blood and fluids . <PARA> another question posed by many readers involved presence of formalin in the operating room . it is typically used for routine histology , and it was likely intended for the preservation and analysis of tissue collected during the operation . we contacted wilde with additional questions about that subject , and he explained : <PARA> fedyaeva ’ s death remains under investigation , but initial reports indicated that a nurse mistakenly used formalin instead of saline to wash a surgical site . the patient was eventually transported to moscow in efforts to reverse the damage , but she died a few days later . it appears that reports about inadvertent substitution of formalin for saline was correct , but the rest of the tragic medical mishap was misrepresented in many news accounts .

false	an image of an elephant standing near a tram with its mouth open is frequently shared on social media , attached to an odd story about the kray twins , who were two of the most feared mobsters in london during the 1950s and 1960s and whose glittering , violent lives as nightclub owners turned organized crime leaders have been memorialized in popular culture . <PARA> the elephant supposedly was connected to the start of their “ reign of terror ” in london : <PARA> the caption says : <PARA> unfortunately , none of this is true . the image does not feature the kray twins , it was not taken in 1960 , and it does not show the beginnings of any sort of reign of terror , unless you have an unusual definition of the word . according to the caption provided by getty images , this photograph was taken in december 1936 on grays inn road in london : <PARA> it ’ s unclear when this image first became associated with a story about the kray twins . this photograph has been accompanied by the erroneous caption since at least june 2016 , when it was posted by the “ pictures in history ” twitter account . the caption also contains some misinformation about london ’ s trams . this photograph could not have been taken in 1960 , as the tram system ended in 1952 ( it later returned in 2000 ): <PARA> this image has nothing to do with the kray twins , but it did make us wonder : did reggie and ronnie kray really use elephants to terrorize london tram riders ? no , not that we can tell . no in - depth look at their lives or careers that we were able to find made any mention of pilfering pachyderms .

true	in february 2018 , the web site newsner , which produces viral content , recounted the horrifying story of the death of katie flynn , a seven - year - old girl who was decapitated in a devastating car crash on long island , new york , in 2005 . <PARA> we received several enquiries about the veracity of the article , and a similar one published by trending stylist , on 28 february . <PARA> unfortunately , it ’ s true . in the early hours of 3 july 2005 , a drunk driver traveling at 70 miles per hour the wrong way down a highway crashed into a limousine carrying several members of katie ’ s family , who were returning home after a wedding . <PARA> the collision caused the instant deaths of the limousine ’ s driver , 59 - year - old stanley rabinowitz and seven - year - old katie flynn , a niece of the bride . other passengers suffered serious injuries , including chris tangney , the father of the bride , whose leg was broken so badly in the crash that it had to be amputated . <PARA> as cnn reported in 2008 : <PARA> this fact check includes links to court testimony that some readers might find disturbing . <PARA> in february 2007 , new york supreme court justice alan honorof sentenced 25 - year - old martin heidgen to a minimum of 18 years in prison on two counts of second - degree “ depraved indifference ” murder , and related charges . <PARA> heidgen had been drinking for several hours in manhattan and nassau county , before he drove his pick - up truck into the limousine . <PARA> at the trial , there was some dispute over whether katie flynn had been wearing a seat belt at the time of the collision . <PARA> dr michael demartino , who conducted flynn ’ s autopsy , testified under cross - examination from the defense that his autopsy report had described her as a “ rear seat unrestrained passenger ,” based on preliminary information provided to demartino by some first responders . <PARA> however , demartino agreed with the prosecution that flynn ’ s injuries were “ consistent with a child who had been lap belted and was lying down on a bench seat and thrown forward during the high - speed crash ,” but also said that the injuries “ might be ” consistent with the girl not wearing a seat belt . <PARA> ultimately , demartino appeared to lean heavily toward the likelihood that flynn had been wearing a seat belt at the time of her death , and that the seat belt getting caught around her neck may have led directly to the terrible manner of her death . <PARA> he noted that had she not been wearing a seat belt , it would have been reasonable to expect much more severe injuries to the rest of her body than were actually observed , namely “ very small bruising ” to her left knee and elbow and some bruising on her left hand . <PARA> furthermore , the family of katie flynn , who were present in the limousine with her that night , adamantly insisted that she was wearing a seat belt . <PARA> at the trial , jennifer flynn — katie ’ s mother , and the sister of the bride — testified that her husband neil had placed katie on a bench seat in the limousine , and “ seat belted her in ” while she was sleeping . <PARA> chris tangney — a retired nassau county police officer , father of the bride , and grandfather of katie flynn — similarly testified that the girl had been lying down , asleep , on a bench seat in the limousine , with her seat belt buckled , at the time of the collision . <PARA> in a devastating and scathing victim impact statement read out to the court , jennifer flynn said : <PARA> in 2010 , jennifer and neil flynn took part in an anti - drunk driving campaign in new york state , describing the terrible impact of katie ’ s death .	
false	as surviving students of a deadly february 2018 high school shooting in parkland , florida , started the # neveragain movement advocating for stricter gun laws , some of the more cynical opponents of gun control set about attacking the teenagers and their message . <PARA> while some stuck to deriding the students as too young and emotional to comment on policy , others went much further than that — for example , cooking up conspiracy theories calling them “ crisis actors ,” an especially offensive rumor that has been used against survivors of mass shootings and loved ones of those who have been killed in them : that no one has ever died in any of these events , and that every bloodied body or grieving family member appearing in public is all fake , part of a grand conspiracy bankrolled by liberals to push gun control . years after the sandy hook mass shooting , for example , victims ’ families still report harassment and death threats . <PARA> amidst all of this , a fake tweet emerged aimed at defaming david hogg , one of the most vocal survivors of the 14 february 2018 high school shooting in which a gunman murdered seventeen people : <PARA> the earliest example of this message that we could uncover was a 26 february 2018 thread on the web site 4chan where a user posted it without any source information . the users debated briefly about whether the image was real ( it ’ s not ) before devolving into a litany of racial slurs . <PARA> the fake message was supposedly posted in june 2016 , but it does not appear on hogg ’ s timeline , nor is there any cached record of it stored anywhere ( yet there are dozens of other tweets from hogg archived ): <PARA> david hogg did not post this homophobic message on twitter . this is a doctored image that was created in an attempt to smear the reputation of a young man who survived a school shooting . and this is a good time for a reminder : it is incredibly easy to create hoax tweets . proceed with caution .	
false	in late february 2018 , an article posted to “ alternative health ” blog healthnutnews . com began circulating , leading readers to believe that the vice president of the pharmaceutical giant pfizer had “ blown the whistle ” on gardasil , a vaccine that protects against human papillomavirus , an umbrella term for several viruses spread by intimate contact which can lead to cervical cancer if left untreated . the headline on the story cautions that the vaccine is “ deadly .” <PARA> the article is a misleading and confusing hodgepodge of conflicting information , including quotes from medical professionals taken out of context and purposely mischaracterized . for example , the “ pfizer vice president ” referenced in the headline is dr . peter rost , who was not the vice president but a vice president of marketing for pfizer , and who was fired in 2005 after a public skirmish with his employer in which he claimed to be a whistleblower over drug pricing . <PARA> of course , it ’ s unclear how a an executive would “ blow the whistle ” on a product his company doesn ’ t make anyway — gardisil is manufactured by merck , not pfizer . <PARA> the healthnutnews . com story contradicts its own headline within the first two paragraphs : <PARA> in the roughly two - minute video embedded in the story , rost never mentions gardasil or any vaccine at all . instead , he appears to be talking in general terms about his views on the pharmaceutical industry ’ s “ buying influence ” over academic institutions and building too - cozy relationships with researchers who should be unbiased in testing drugs — hardly an earth - shattering revelation about a specific vaccine or treatment . <PARA> the article also contains two quotes from two medical publishing professionals , neither of whom was talking about vaccines or their efficacy : <PARA> both angell and horton edit two prominent medical journals , and both have written editorials that criticize scientific studies and concerns over conflicts of interest created by relationships between researchers and pharmaceutical companies . neither mentioned vaccines , however . in an e - mail , horton told us : <PARA> angell ’ s quote was taken from a 2015 op - ed in the new york review of books , in which she wrote : <PARA> this fear - mongering about alleged dangers of hpv vaccines is not based in any fact . according to the centers for disease control and prevention , the vaccines are safe for most of the public , though ( like any drug ) they may have side effects , or in rare cases , may result in an allergic reaction . it ’ s not the first time a vaccine has been falsely accused of causing ailments , when they in fact guard the general public from outbreaks — a previous healthnutnews . com story falsely reported that vaccines were causing 2018 ’ s deadly influenza season . <PARA> hpv vaccines have been controversial in part because they guard young girls against a sexually - transmitted virus that can lead to cervical cancer ; thus , critics often blur the line between religious and anti - science hysteria when discouraging their use . as joseph uscinski , associate professor of political science at the university of miami , pointed out , paranoia about this particular vaccine is enabled by parents who are afraid that providing girls with the vaccine will somehow promote promiscuity : <PARA> he pointed to 2011 , when former minnesota representative and far - right christian activist michele bachmann attacked then - presidential candidate and texas governor rick perry for an hpv vaccine mandate , falsely saying it causes “ mental retardation .” uscinski said :	
false	a decades - old photograph showing sen . chuck schumer ( d - new york ) firing a gun popped up online in february 2018 , as the debate on gun control ramped up in the aftermath of a mass shooting at a high school in parkland , florida that left seventeen people dead . this image was frequently included in memes which also carried the claim that the senate minority leader had a concealed weapons permit : <PARA> the image is real , but it does not show schumer using his own firearm , nor does it have anything to do with an alleged concealed carry permit . it dates back to 1994 , when schumer and other lawmakers argued for a ban on assault weapons at a media event in washington , d . c . the senator fired the weapon , a tec - 9 pistol , in an attempt to demonstrate the dangers of the weapon . both the new york times and the chicago tribune published editorials at the time that criticized the demonstration , arguing that it only muddied the waters on the issue : <PARA> the claim that schumer was or is licensed to carry a concealed weapon has appeared online for several years . we have seen this claim posted on numerous web sites , blogs , internet forums , and social media sites , but we have yet to encounter any evidence to back it up . <PARA> it seems to have originated in a september 2005 article published on a blog called renewamerica . com . the author , jim kouri , is a conservative media personality who claims to be a former chief of police on his muckrack profile . however — as far as we can tell — kouri never worked as a police chief , but rather as a director of public safety and police services for the new york state division of housing and community renewal . <PARA> kouri claimed that “ a check of pistol license records ” revealed that schumer had an “ unrestricted ” pistol permit , but provided no information about how these records were obtained or any evidence that schumer was indeed listed in this database . he also claimed that this rumor was originally pushed by conservative radio host mark levin , but again , provided no documentation to show when and where levin allegedly made this comment : <PARA> if levin did truly make such a statement ( he did chastise sen . diane feinstein in 2005 for having a concealed carry permit , something she did have , but got rid of in 2012 ), it is not a claim that he has often repeated . we found no record of levin accusing schumer of having a concealed carry permit prior to the publication of kouri ’ s article , nor at any other time since . <PARA> kouri , on the other hand , has repeated this claim in at least two subsequent articles : one published in 2012 and another in 2016 . interestingly , the 2016 piece parroted a list of more than two dozen democrats who owned guns from short - lived right - leaning news site heatstreet . com , which was based on data from usa today and did not include schumer ’ s name . <PARA> the unfounded rumor gained wider attention in 2010 when republican senate candidate jay townsend repeated it during a debate with schumer . the new york senator responded by saying that he did not own a gun , nor did he have a license for one : <PARA> schumer ’ s press office confirmed that the senator did not have a concealed weapons permit at the time by sharing a letter from susan petito , the assistant commissioner of intergovernmental affairs : <PARA> townsend directed the media to an article published on american daily in 2005 to support his claim that schumer was licensed . that american daily article , however , was just a reprint of kouri ’ s original opinion piece which offered no evidence to support its claim . <PARA> a spokesperson told us that schumer has not applied for or received a gun license since this letter was sent in 2009 . we reached out to the nypd to confirm this information , but did not hear back by press time .	
mixture	in february 2018 , as americans still reeled from a deadly school shooting in florida and gun lobbying groups floated proposals to arm teachers to defend their classrooms , various web sites posted articles conveying the claim that gov . jerry brown had signed a law in california prohibiting teachers from doing just that . <PARA> “ liberals want to ban teachers from having their god - given right to defend the young and innocent from mass shooters ,” wrote the author of a 22 february post on the web sites right edition and truth and action : <PARA> in fact , however , california ’ s ab 424 was not enacted in reaction to the florida high school shooting . it had been passed and signed by the state ’ s governor several months before that event , in october 2017 . <PARA> nor is “ banning teachers from being able to shoot back ” an objective and impartial description of the bill ’ s content . ( a 15 october 2017 article from breitbart was similarly misleading , alleging that gov . brown had signed a bill “ ensuring that teachers can ’ t shoot back if attacked .”) <PARA> the main consequence of the bill ’ s passage is that k - 12 school district officials are no longer able to grant special authorization for teachers and other school employees to carry firearms on school grounds — an exception to california ’ s gun - free school zone act of 1995 that was rarely taken advantage of in the first place . <PARA> the official summary of ab 424 reads as follows : <PARA> the gun - free school zone act originally prohibited the possession of firearms on or within 1 , 000 feet of school grounds , except in two cases : concealed weapons permit holders were permitted to carry firearms in gun - free school zones ( a provision that had already been repealed in 2015 ), and persons granted written permission by school district authorities could do so ( the provision that was repealed by ab 424 ). <PARA> since ab 424 went into effect on 1 january 2018 , it has been illegal for anyone besides security guards , law enforcement officers , military personnel engaged in official duties , and armored vehicle guards to possess firearms on or near k - 12 school grounds in california . the law does not apply to college campuses . <PARA> only a “ handful ” of california ’ s roughly 1 , 024 school districts had actually initiated programs to grant school employees permission to carry weapons , according to the sacramento bee ( associated press estimated the number at about five ). the wall street journal reported that at least eight states currently allowed teachers “ in some capacity ” to carry guns on k - 12 school grounds . <PARA> forty - four percent of americans surveyed in a cbs news poll taken after the parkland , florida , school shootings favored allowing more teachers to carry guns .	
false	in early february 2018 , the untrustworthy web site yournewswire and a number of other questionable sources posted a report alleging that first lady melania trump had demanded that the white house be exorcised to cleanse it of “ obama demons ” before she would set foot in it : <PARA> the article was based on an interview with evangelical pastor paul begley ( who is not , in any sense we could verify , a “ white house pastor ”), who told internet radio host sheila zilinsky that a literal “ exorcism ” was conducted in the white house between the time the obamas left the building and the time the trumps entered it on inauguration day 2017 : <PARA> far from expressing skepticism about the preacher ’ s claims , however , cnsnews quoted a 2010 washington post article about bill and hillary clinton ’ s trips to haiti to corroborate begley ’ s assertion that “ there were all kinds of idol gods and images and all kinds of artifacts in there that were demonic , even some of the stuff from the clinton era because they were really tied in with the haitians .” <PARA> what the post article actually said was : <PARA> as to the obamas , we ’ ve seen no credible reports to the effect that they kept any sort of “ demonic ” artifacts in the white house . <PARA> in any case , the absurd allegation that a white house exorcism took place was debunked on 10 february by stephanie grisham , a spokeswoman for melania trump , who told associated press that it was “ not true in any way .”	
true	in the aftermath of the 14 february 2018 mass shooting at a high school in parkland , florida , gun rights activists and lobbyists , in particular the national rifle association ( nra ) have come under renewed scrutiny . <PARA> in this context , influential gun control advocates shared a letter that , to some , exemplified the influence of the nra over candidates for political office . on 18 february , the actor and activist alyssa milano tweeted a copy of a letter purportedly sent by the nra to tim burns , a candidate for wisconsin supreme court judge . <PARA> the letter is real . the nra sent it out a few weeks before the school shooting at marjory stoneman douglas high school . in it , the nra asked candidates for the wisconsin supreme court to submit a position letter outlining their stance on guns , which the nra would condense and distribute to its members in the state . <PARA> a spokesperson for tim burns , a candidate in the nonpartisan judicial primary election , sent us a photograph of the letter and the envelope it arrived in , as well as email correspondence establishing its authenticity . burns ’ s campaign tweeted a cropped photograph of the letter on 29 january 2018 , with one section underlined : <PARA> burns ’ s spokesperson told us they shared a photograph of the letter with a network of contacts , and that it reached milano , who asked the burns campaign for permission to share the letter on twitter . <PARA> the nra letter was addressed “ dear wisconsin judicial candidate ,” suggesting that it was sent to all three candidates in the 20 february 2018 primary election . we sought confirmation of this from the other two — judge rebecca dallet and judge michael screnock — but we did not hear back from them in time for publication . <PARA> although the primary was officially nonpartisan , burns and dallet appealed to democrats , while screnock garnered support from the republican party . <PARA> in the end , screnock was the only candidate to receive an endorsement from the nra . in a 13 february press release , the group said screnock was “ the only candidate seeking election to return a position statement indicating his support for constitutional rights . his opponents refused to return a candidate position statement .” <PARA> chris cox , chairman of the nra political victory fund ( the group ’ s political action committee , which hands out grades and endorsements ) urged voters to elect screnock . <PARA> both screnock and dallet made it through the primary , and will now be on the ballot for the 3 april 2018 general election to the wisconsin supreme court . tim burns failed to make it to the next round .	
mixture	president donald trump ’ s reported request to create a grand military parade caused controversy in early 2018 , with critics condemning the idea as “ authoritarian .” others urged tolerance of the plan , pointing out that previous u . s . presidents such as john f . kennedy and gen . dwight d . eisenhower had included troops and weaponry in their inaugural parades . <PARA> against this background , a widely shared meme emerged in february 2018 containing a purported quotation from general eisenhower which would lend support to those critical of trump ’ s proposed parade : <PARA> this statement appears to be not quite a direct quotation by eisenhower , but rather a paraphrasing of the general - turned - president ’ s position on military parades , which originated in remarks made by the renowned presidential historian michael beschloss . <PARA> in an interview with npr ’ s “ all things considered ” broadcast on 7 february 2018 , beschloss pointed out that previous commanders - in - chief had held military parades as recently as 1991 . however , he noted a distinction between victory parades celebrating national triumphs and inaugurations and the possibility of such a parade ’ s taking place under president trump outside of those circumstances : <PARA> during the cold war , eisenhower ’ s aides suggested to him that the united states should emulate and rival the grand military parades frequently held at that time by the soviets . eisenhower rejected the proposals , according to beschloss : “ eisenhower said ‘ absolutely not . we , the united states , are seeking peace , we are the pre - eminent power on earth . for us to try to imitate what the soviets are doing in red square would make us look weak .'” <PARA> however , eisenhower was not entirely opposed to military rallies . after the end of world war ii , in august 1945 , the general even joined josef stalin in moscow for a victory parade at red square . and as we ’ ve mentioned , ike ’ s inaugural parade in 1953 featured troops marching in formation , as well as a display of weaponry . <PARA> several historians we spoke to told us “ ike ” would indeed have been opposed to a show of military strength that was not linked to a specific military victory or some other special national occasion . <PARA> none of the experts we consulted knew of a specific conversation between eisenhower and his staff in which he rejected the idea of a soviet - style military parade , and we were unable to pinpoint any such proposal or conversation in a number of books about the 34th president . <PARA> we were also unable to contact michael beschloss , in order to clarify the origins of his remarks about eisenhower ’ s stance on the prospect of a military parade . however , beschloss ’ comments don ’ t appear to be a direct quotation from eisenhower , but rather a statement of ike ’ s views on the subject . in an email , ohio university historian chester pach told us he concurred with beschloss ’ s interpretation . <PARA> pach , who is co - author of the presidency of dwight d . eisenhower , told us the general would have responded negatively to any proposal to hold a soviet - style military rally : “ my guess is that eisenhower would have rejected that advice if he got it . he wasn ’ t someone invested in pomp and circumstance . he knew that power had to be effective in ways other than elaborate displays of military might .”	
true	while the federal bureau of investigations ( fbi ) continued its investigation into the fatal shooting attack at a parkland , florida , high school on 14 february 2018 , the agency revealed that it failed to act upon a tip alerting them as to the suspect ’ s potential for violence . <PARA> on 16 february 2018 , the fbi said in a statement that someone “ close to ” the suspect , 19 - year - old nikolas cruz , reported their concerns to the bureau by phone on 5 january 2018 . according to the statement : <PARA> the statement came shortly after a youtube user from mississippi revealed that he had an online brush with someone with the same name as the suspected gunman . <PARA> as buzzfeed and other outlets reported , 36 - year - old ben bennight contacted fbi officials in september 2017 , after a user with the name “ nikolas cruz ” left a comment on one of bennight ’ s videos saying , “ i ’ m going to be a professional school shooter .” <PARA> cruz was arrested in connection with the attack at marjory stoneman douglas high school , which left 17 dead and several injured . the day after the shooting , cruz was charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder . <PARA> however , authorities said in a press conference that they had not determined whether the suspect was the same person who left the threatening comment on bennight ’ s video . according to special agent robert lasky : <PARA> bennight said that he first spoke to bureau agents on 25 september 2017 — the day after he flagged the comment — and again on the night of the shooting . he reiterated to the officials that he did not know the identity of the commenter . in a video he posted after the shooting , bennight said : <PARA> both the comment and youtube account associated with it have been taken down . <PARA> on 15 february 2018 , the jewish advocacy group the anti - defamation league reported that cruz “ had participated in one or more training exercises ” with a white supremacist group , the republic of florida ( rof ). according to an rof spokesperson , jordan jereb , the group did not order or intend for cruz to undertake any violent action . however , local law enforcement told reporters that there is no indication of any ties between cruz and any militant groups , including rof . <PARA> in may 2017 , fbi and homeland security officials reportedly said in an intelligence bulletin that white supremacist groups “ likely will continue to pose a threat of lethal violence over the next year .” critics have accused the federal government of not devoting enough resources to identify and stifle threats by such organizations . <PARA> we contacted the fbi seeking further comment but did not hear back by time of publication .	
false	on 11 february 2018 , an unofficial facebook fan page dedicated to white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders posted a ( since - removed ) video with the obvious intent of spreading false information and hatred directed at muslims . the video is adorned with poorly - written english captions that read as follows : <PARA> the video did not offer any specific information and was purportedly created by an outlet called “ us politics info center ,” which is a clickbait - driven , fake news web site . <PARA> the entire 20 - second clip lacked anything resembling accurate information . although the jumpsuit - wearing men depicted in it had been convicted of serious and vicious crimes , neither of them did what the video claimed of them . the apparent “ american teenage ,” the sobbing young man in royal blue depicted in the video , was dylan schumaker , a 21 - year - old man from new york state who in 2014 was sentenced to 25 years for beating his girlfriend ’ s toddler to death . <PARA> the bearded man in darker blue who appeared in the video handcuffed with his head down was osvaldo rivera of new jersey , who in 2014 was given a life sentence for raping a 12 - year - old girl at knifepoint and murdering her 6 - year - old brother when the child tried to save his sister . there was no indication of either his religion or his citizenship status in the reporting of his crimes , but the basic facts of his case would still be lacking any relevance to this video even if the badly written captions described them with anything approaching accuracy . <PARA> it is highly unlikely that the facebook page with 10 , 000 - plus fans dedicated to sanders has any connection to her other than in name . we sent an inquiry to the white house press office but received no response .	
false	an image purportedly showing a river that froze into the shape of a spooky face has been circulating on the internet for a number of years . some say that it resembles the mask that the character ghostface wore in the scream movie series ; others say it looks like edvard munch ’ s famous painting the scream : <PARA> people who post the image usually claim that it shows russia ’ s irtysh river on a particularly cold day . some even invented a backstory : <PARA> the earliest iteration of this fake photograph that we could uncover was posted to the russian web site pikabu . ru on 13 march 2015 along with a caption ( translated via google ) “ friday the 13th . scream !” the image quickly went viral on the social media sites such as vk . com and livejournal where it earned the unofficial title “ scream of the irtysh .” <PARA> the image is based on a genuine photograph of the irtysh river . the “ ghostface ,” however , appears courtesy of digital editing software . <PARA> russian photographer andrei kudryavtsev took the original photograph and posted it in march 2012 to his web site “ omsk streets ” ( omsk is the city along the banks of this river in the image ). kudryavtsev also posted the image to his vk . com page where it was captioned : “ весна наступает . иртыш сегодня !!!” ( in english “ spring comes . irtysh today !”). <PARA> here ’ s a comparison of the kudryavtsev ’ s photograph ( left ) and the altered “ scream of the irtysh ” image ( right ): <PARA> kudryavtsev also posted an alternative view of the thawing river on his web site .	
false	on 5 may 2016 , a british tabloid ran a headline with an alarming concern : “ are flower seeds the new party drug ?” the question was the result of a local news story from seekonk , massachuchets , whose police department issued a warning about youths purchasing morning glory seeds from home depot as a substitute for lsd , and subsequently having a bad time : <PARA> the headline misleadingly makes the practice sound like an epidemic , but home depot did confirm to us that they temporarily moved the seeds from their seekonk store in response to a warning from the local police department , but that it was not a permanent move nor a move that affected any other stores . <PARA> the seekonk incident , however , highlights a common claim made of these seeds : that they contain a plausible chemical substitute to the hallucinogenic drug lsd called lysergic acid amide ( lsa , also known as ergine ). for example , the anarchist ’ s cookbook , a controversial counterculture publication from the 1970s , includes a recipe for “ making lsd in the kitchen ” which claims to extract “ the lysergic acid amides either from morning glory seeds or hawaiian woodrose seeds .” <PARA> indeed , the seeds of these and some other plants in the family convolvulaceae ( a broad classification of plants ) do contain lsa . these plants , especially hawaiian woodrose , have been used by numerous cultures as a traditional medicine and as an intoxicant for ceremonial practices . a 2014 paper investigating the psychoactive effects of the seeds of hawaiian baby woodrose described the effects , which the authors attributed primarily to lsa : <PARA> while preliminary , that study attempted to uncover the neurologic mechanism behind lsa ’ s effects using chemical tests to predict which receptors in the brain the chemical targets , revealing that they likely occur through mechanisms that are biologically different the ones that cause lsd ’ s more famous psychedelic effects . instead , lsa primarily promotes the less spiritually fulfilling and potentially more dangerous “ vegetative side effects ”: <PARA> in fact , a small - scale 2012 study which attempted to investigate the effects of lsa on human subjects had to be cancelled due to adverse side effects : <PARA> while it is accurate to state that the lsa contained in some convolvulaceae seeds could potentially create ( unpleasant ) psychoactive effects , both the way the chemical produces those effects as well as the prevalence of separate dangerous physical side effects mean that it is far from an “ alternative ” for lsd .	
false	attorney general jeff sessions is perhaps the nation ’ s most prominent critic of marijuana use , and a fervent opponent of its legalization . at a senate committee hearing in april 2016 , he supported the view that “ good people don ’ t smoke marijuana .” <PARA> as the nation ’ s top federal law enforcement official , he has reversed obama - era guidelines that instructed federal prosecutors to ease up on smaller - scale cannabis possession and distribution convictions . <PARA> so it would come as a considerable shock to discover that during his college days , before he embarked on a career as a prosecutor and politician , sessions was purportedly an out - and - out pothead , extolling the virtues of weed in a student rock band . <PARA> that ’ s the claim made in a satirical video posted to facebook and youtube in january 2018 , by the los angeles comedy group mommy , who run the very serious content facebook page . <PARA> we received several enquiries from readers who weren ’ t quite sure whether the video documented a remarkable u - turn in sessions ’ s worldview , or it was just a joke . <PARA> it ’ s just a joke . <PARA> the video is formatted in the style of much video content produced by serious news organizations for social media , with a summary of the story in text superimposed over images and video clips , accompanied by somber backing music . this stylistic nod is likely what tricked some viewers into thinking it might be authentic . <PARA> the video report claims the future attorney general headed a band called “ the jeff sessions ,” whose recordings — with names like “ i married mary jane ” and “ the open road is paved with green ” — have “ leaked .” <PARA> a black - and - white photograph at the start of the video appears to show a young sessions smoking a spliff with a guitar strapped to his back . this is an edited version of a real photograph from sessions ’ s high school yearbook ( in which he was neither smoking anything , nor carrying an instrument of any kind ). <PARA> the guitar - playing , leather jacket - wearing person presumed to be sessions on the cover of “ the open road is paved with green ” is actually eric clapton , with the future attorney general ’ s face superimposed on to his . <PARA> the wedding photograph that serves as the cover of “ i married mary jane ” is an edited version of a real photograph of sessions ’ s 1969 wedding to his wife mary . <PARA> mommy — the comedy group behind very serious content — told us all the “ leaked ” songs featured in the video were self - recorded . <PARA> very serious content is labelled an “ entertainment web site ” on facebook , and describes itself , with tongue firmly in cheek , as “ a very serious video network for people who get their very serious news on mobile devices .”	
mixture	in early february 2018 , the facebook page of outback steakhouse was awash in angry posts from consumers pledging never again to dine at the chain because it purportedly had a no - gun policy and had kicked out a “ uniformed police officer ” with a gun in tennessee : <PARA> the backlash stemmed from a 2 february 2018 facebook post published to the shared account andrew - amanda ward , which in part characterized all outback steakhouse locations as “ gun free zones .” the post went on to describe the incident in which a customer became frightened by the presence of a firearm : <PARA> later on 2 february 2018 the same account shared an update saying that outback had sent a $ 100 gift card to the person who was kicked out . the post reiterated that the group of officers had not threatened anyone . <PARA> the first post quickly went viral , and news outlets like wtsp reported the story using the facebook posts as their only source . <PARA> chattanooga ’ s wrcbtv identified the individual as a tennessee wildlife resources agency officer ( not a state trooper or local police officer , as stated or implied in other articles and on social media ; they are both law enforcement , but work in different departments ) and included a statement from outback steakhouse : <PARA> we contacted outback ’ s parent company , bloomin ’ brands , for clarification but had not received a response by press time .	
true	an image purportedly showing democratic lawmakers checking their phones during president donald trump ’ s state of the union address was posted by breitbart ’ s white house correspondent charlie spiering on 30 january 2018 along with the claim that the image occurred during a portion of the speech about caring for veterans . this tweet was then turned into a meme and subsequently posted to facebook pages such as usa patriots for donald trump : <PARA> the claim that it occurred during a portion of the speech about caring for veterans is also mostly true . one could quibble with this assertion and argue that this image was actually broadcast after president trump mentioned a variety of groups and topics ( including americans , senators , supreme court justices , the 2nd amendment , and veterans ) and just before he mentioned a piece of legislation aimed at caring for veterans . <PARA> here ’ s a transcript of this portion of the speech . the bolded “ screenshot ” signifies when the image appeared on screen : <PARA> it ’ s also true that the pictured lawmakers were democrats . abc news labeled this section of the audience as “ democratic members of congress ” in the caption of a photograph , and we believe we have identified the two women at the center of the photograph as rep . zoe lofgren ( d - california ) and rep . madeleine bordallo ( d - guam ). <PARA> here is video of the moment : <PARA> a spokesperson for lofgren told us via e - mail that the california representative was sharing a news article with her colleague and that the “ controversy ” over her use of a phone during the state of the union equated to “ faux outrage ”: <PARA> we also found a handful of other people using phones during president trump ’ s speech . <PARA> democrats certainly weren ’ t as enthused as their republican counterparts during trump ’ s first state of the union , but the “ disrespectful ” act of using a cellphone appears to have occurred on both sides of the aisle . we have not been able to identify the politicians using their phones in the following image , but this section of the crowd was labeled “ republican ” by the washington post . well - known republicans such as peter king can also be seen in close proximity to the two men on their phones : <PARA> similarly , some democratic lawmakers were spotted on their phones during another portion of the speech : <PARA> we also examined video of president barack obama ’ s final state of the union address . again , we found several examples of politicians using their phones ( and even a tablet ) during the speech . <PARA> in other words , the use of a phone during the state of the union address is not unprecedented or uncommon . and while some may argue that this is a sign of disrespect , it is not a habit inherent to any specific political party .	
true	one day before president trump ’ s first state of the union address on 30 january 2018 , images appeared on social media of invitations to the event issued by the house of representatives in which the word “ union ” was misspelled “ uniom .” <PARA> rep . raul grijalva ( d - arizona ) and senator marco rubio ( r - florida ), among others , tweeted images of the tickets : <PARA> although many were quick to blame republicans and the white house for the snafu , the actual responsibility for issuing the tickets rests with the office of the house of representatives ’ sergeant - at - arms . nbc news reported that a source in that office acknowledged the misprint and said replacement tickets are being printed for redistribution .

false	on 20 january 2018 , the web site reaganwasright . com published an article reporting ( somewhat incoherently ) that leading democratic figures — in addition to billionaire george soros — had “ worlds to gain ” by effecting a shutdown of the u . s . federal government , and that the shutdown was somehow connected to a secret service report warning of a military coup against president trump : <PARA> none of this was true , save for the fact that the u . s . government did experience a brief shutdown in january 2018 as republicans and democrats wrangled over immigration policy and other issues . the u . s . secret service issued no such report , nor did any credible news organization cover such an occurrence . this story originated solely with reaganwasright . com , a site that is part of a network of fake news sites dedicated to spreading political misinformation under the guise of proffering “ satire .”	
false	in january 2018 , amid a brief government shutdown and a furor over the potential deportation of recipients of the delayed action for childhood arrivals act , or daca , a months - old meme reappeared featuring a photograph of house minority leader nancy pelosi ( d - california ) and a quote about how building a wall on the southern united states border “ will violate the right of millions of illegals ”: <PARA> the graphic proved popular in some conservative circles , where it was shared along with messages that insult pelosi as dumb , clueless , or out of touch . it was also frequently attached to comments asserting ( inaccurately ) that the rights of “ illegals ” couldn ’ t be violated since illegal immigrants don ’ t have any rights to violate : <PARA> first of all , this is not a quote from nancy pelosi . the meme has been shared all over social media , but despite its near - ubiquity , we have yet to encounter any citation whatsoever , or a single posting stating where or when pelosi might have given this statement ; further , no video or audio evidence has been presented to confirm that pelosi used this phrasing , and we found no record from any credible news source . ( there is also already a nearly 700 - mile - long barrier at the border , a fact that pelosi , a california politician , knows very well .) <PARA> this fake quote originally appeared in august 2017 , after u . s . president donald trump threatened a government shutdown in order to secure funding for a border wall . nancy pelosi released a statement in response which labeled the wall “ immoral ” ( emphasis ours ): <PARA> this fake quote began to circulate shortly after pelosi released that statement : <PARA> the argument might be made that this particular meme paraphrases pelosi ’ s attitude toward the wall . however , it naturally became incorrectly presented as though it was a direct quote from house minority leader : <PARA> the idea that undocumented people can ’ t have their rights violated because they have no rights to begin with is false . undocumented people may not enjoy all of the constitutional rights given to american citizens , but they do have some protections under the law . furthermore , referring to undocumented people as “ illegal ” is not accurate , as the violation in and of itself is civil , not criminal : <PARA> even so , undocumented individuals do have rights in the united states , despite concerted disinformation and propaganda efforts to obscure them . the supreme court ruled in 2001 , for instance , that the due process clause ( that is , the 14th amendment ) applies to “ all persons within the united states , including aliens , whether their presence is lawful , unlawful , temporary , or permanent .”	
false	on 12 january 2018 , mic . com published an article under the headline “ eating alligator in new orleans could help save the wetlands of louisiana .” the story presented the testimony of nathan richard , a louisiana alligator chef and hunter , who argued that — because alligators are allegedly overpopulated and destroying the louisiana wetlands — eating them could be an ecological and environmental boon : <PARA> the problem with these statements , however , is that they are largely unsupported by scientific evidence . adam rosenblatt , a professor of ecology and the university of north florida who studies apex predators in general ( and alligators specifically ) highlighted a number of factual errors and questionable assumptions in a tweet thread : <PARA> after the publication of our article , mic issued a correction to their story and altered it to largely remove the focus from the purported ecological benefits of alligator hunting , noting that biologists do not consider the alligator to be overpopulated . <PARA> the first problem with the premise presented in the original article was the claim that louisiana is overpopulated by alligators . scientifically speaking , overpopulation is a specific term that refers to a population of organisms that exceeds the resources ( called carrying capacity ) inherent to its ecological niche . the article provided no evidence ( beyond richard ’ s quote ) that this condition exists . it is worth noting , in fact , that the louisiana department of wildlife and fisheries does not consider the alligator species overpopulated . rather , a fact sheet offered on their website describes the population as “ stable .” <PARA> furthermore , evidence suggest that alligators in louisiana are not overpopulated . in addition to habitat destruction , rosenblatt told us , telltale signs of overpopulation include animal starvation and negative population growth . yet according to the louisiana dwf ( in a document linked by the mic . com article ), “ alligator populations in louisiana increased consistently from 1970 to 1999 , have remained stable / slightly increasing for the last 10 years , and currently remain at high levels .” high levels , here , by no means refers to the scientific concept of overpopulation , and is a reference to the fact that the species has recovered from near extinction levels in the 1960s . <PARA> by far the more problematic claim in the original story , however , was the notion that alligators are actively destroying wetland habitats . this article cited the u . s . geological survey ( usgs ) in a way that misleadingly suggested the research agency endorsed a theory that alligators were contributing to the reduction wetland area in louisiana : <PARA> the usgs , in that report , listed a number of factors that are contributing to the decline of wetlands , such as human impacts , land use changes , and rising sea level — but alligators were not mentioned even once . a 2013 study on the future prospects of louisiana ’ s wetland ecosystems that summarized the main contributors to habitat loss similarly gave a snub to alligators . rosenblatt told us he is wholly unaware of any research linking alligators to habitat destruction in louisiana . “ i ’ ve probably read about 95 percent of the existing scientific literature on alligator ecology ,” he added . <PARA> an additional rationale provided for why hunting ( and presumably eating ) alligators would provide a net benefit to the ecosystem : that “ too many alligators means too many fish and turtles being killed .” this assertion , rosenblatt said , is based on a simplistic and outmoded view of the connection between ecosystems and apex predators . a 2011 paper in biological reviews argued that predators often play a vital role in maintaining complex ecosystems : <PARA> alligators in louisiana , specifically , play an important role in regulating the the wetland ecosystem due to their predation on an invasive rodent known as nutria ( introduced for fur trading in the 1930s ). that species , unlike the alligator , has significantly degraded at least 100 , 000 acres of wetland in louisiana . to reduce complexities of an ecosystem to “ turtles and fish = good , alligators = bad ” does a disservice to both ecological science and readers interested in understanding it . <PARA> rosenblatt does agree that alligator hunting is “ an important part of alligator management programs , and alligator meat is delicious ,” but he pushes back against the rationale provided by the original article . “ advocating for hunting because gators are destroying marshes ? there ’ s no evidence for that .” in fact , like the claim of overpopulation , there is evidence against it , rosenblatt said : <PARA> the first version of this article reported on the opinion of an alligator chef without verifying the factual bases underlying his opinions . in truth , no evidence supports either the claim that louisiana alligators are overpopulated or that their presence is contributing to a loss of wetland habitat . it is , perhaps , great press for nathan richard ’ s restaurant , but a fact - based , scientifically - valid investigation it is not . <PARA> we reached out to the writer of this piece for comment , but have not yet heard back .	
false	during an oval office meeting on immigration on 11 january 2018 , president donald trump reportedly used the term “ shit hole ” in reference to african countries and said that he ’ d rather take immigrants from places like norway . the comment was widely condemned in the media ( several news anchors bluntly called the president a racist ) and countries such as botswana and haiti released statements calling for an apology from the president of the united states . <PARA> as the fury grew over trump ’ s comments , some conservative web sites published articles which attempted to defend trump and paint the media as hypocritical by pointing to a seemingly similar comment president barack obama made in 2016 . <PARA> truth feed news , for instance , claimed that obama used the term “ shit show ” in reference to libya and that the remark was ignored by the media : <PARA> this round of whataboutery is rooted in some truth — even though it misses the point that beyond the use of a profane term , context and broader implications have earned different responses . trump ’ s comment , when paired with his isolationist immigration policies and gross generalizations about criminality of black and brown people , was widely interpreted to be racist . <PARA> conversely , obama reportedly used the term “ shit show ” in private to refer to the escalating violence in libya . however , this comment was covered by the mainstream media at the time ( something truth feed news must have been aware of since they referenced two mainstream reports in their article claiming that the mainstream media ignored the comments ). <PARA> obama ’ s coarse language was first mentioned in an interview with the atlantic : <PARA> outlets such as truthfeednews attempted to draw a direct parallel between obama ’ s “ shit show ” comment in 2016 and president trump ’ s “ shithole ” remark in 2018 . <PARA> the conspiracy - rooted infowars even chastised reporters and implored the mainstream media to “ look into bo ’ s vocabulary .” although it ’ s true that obama and trump both used a similar vulgarity , these remarks were spoken in different contexts . <PARA> obama was referring to the aftermath of libyan leader muammar gaddafi ’ s death in 2011 which included a civil war and a growing isis presence in the country . obama later said that this was the biggest mistake of his presidency . <PARA> although there are varying accounts of trump ’ s exact phrasing , his “ shithole ” remark was made to describe entire nations , in regard to immigration policy : <PARA> nbc news gave a similar account : <PARA> it ’ s true that obama and trump both used a vulgarity at one point during their presidencies . <PARA> however , obama used the term “ shit show ” to refer to the escalating violence in libya following gaddafi ’ s death in 2011 . president trump used the term “ shit hole ” to describe countries in africa and elsewhere during a meeting on immigration in the oval office .	
true	the botswanan government condemned president donald trump ’ s purported remarks referring to african countries “ shitholes ,” prompting some viewers to question whether a statement ostensibly issued by that country and spread via social media was real . <PARA> the government ’ s statement was circulated both through both through botswana ’ s non -“ verified ” twitter account and via their facebook page , which is directly linked to the country ’ s official web site : <PARA> botswana officials noted that they had “ summoned ” u . s . ambassador earl r . miller regarding the statements that president trump had made during a meeting with lawmakers a day earlier , during which the chief executive allegedly exclaimed : “ what do we want haitians here for ? why do we want all these people from africa here ? why do we want all these people from shithole countries ?” <PARA> the statement from botswana said ( in part ): <PARA> officials in ghana , haiti , senegal , and south africa have also reportedly called for meetings with u . s . diplomats because of the alleged comment . <PARA> in a separate statement , the african union , which represents all 55 countries on the continent , also condemned the reported remark and called for both a retraction and “ an apology not only to the africans but to all people of african descent around the globe .” <PARA> trump , who opened his presidential campaign in 2015 by calling some mexican immigrants “ rapists ” and “ criminals ,” reportedly made the remark during a meeting concerning a deal that would allow for increased security along the u . s .- mexico border , while also allowing for the continuation of the deferred action for childhood arrivals ( daca ) program . <PARA> around 700 , 000 people are currently enrolled in the daca program , which allows enrollees to live and work in the u . s . for two - year periods . a federal judge ruled on 9 january 2018 that the trump administration must accept renewal applications from enrollees . <PARA> the president later said of his controversial remarks on twitter that “ the language used by me at the daca meeting was tough , but this was not the language used . what was really tough was the outlandish proposal made — a big setback for daca !” he also specifically denied saying anything insulting about haiti : <PARA> sen . dick durbin ( d - illinois ) has corroborated the reports concerning trump ’ s alleged remarks , saying that he was at the meeting along with sen . lindsey graham ( r - south carolina ), who also objected to them . <PARA> graham released a statement saying that he “ said [ his ] piece directly ” to trump , but not addressing whether the president had insulted any countries . senate colleague tim scott ( r - south carolina ) said that graham told him that the reports concerning the insults were “ basically accurate .” <PARA> we contacted miller ’ s office in botswana seeking comment , as well as the botswana embassy in washington d . c ., but received no response prior to publication .	
false	oprah winfrey ’ s january 2018 acceptance speech for the golden globes ’ cecil b . demille award may have inspired calls for the entertainment mogul to run for president in 2020 , but it also came with attempts to smear her character , which were usually baseless and almost always in meme form . <PARA> in one such meme , the former talk show host ’ s image is superimposed with an unattributed quote ( supposedly from winfrey ) which describes bringing young women to the home of harvey weinstein , a movie producer who was accused by several women of decades of sexual assault and harassment in an october 2017 story : <PARA> the first indication that this is a fictional quote is the fact that the meme includes any information about where or when winfrey purportedly said it . weinstein ’ s alleged misdeeds and various reactions elicited from celebrities and politicians were extensively covered in the months following the new york times bombshell report that he had paid off several of his accusers , yet we were unable to find this quote in any credible publication . <PARA> furthermore , the unapologetic and unconcerned tone struck in this meme stands in stark contrast to the comments that we know winfrey actually made about the accusation levied at weinstein . the talk show host described weinstein ’ s behavior as “ hideous ” in a facebook post , noting in a cbs interview that the problem of sexual harassment extends out much farther than just weinstein and hollywood : <PARA> although it could be argued that oprah winfrey bears a part of the responsibility shouldered by the rest of hollywood for allowing sexual predation to flourish for decades ( if not generations ), this meme is a hoax and there is no indication that she ever either helped weinstein find alleged victims nor brushed off any of the accusations against him .	
unproven	among the controversies swirling around michael wolff ’ s bestselling exposé fire and fury : inside the trump white house are doubts about its credibility raised by wolff ’ s fellow journalists . <PARA> described by politico as “ a gossipy account of infighting and incompetence in the west wing ,” fire and fury has been criticized for being “ factually sloppy ” ( as daniel drezner put it in the washington post ). as a reporter , wolff doesn ’ t shy away from repeating unverified anecdotes , even claims that in some cases have been investigated and rejected as unworthy by other journalists . <PARA> an example of this noted by some reporters on social media revolves around an incident that allegedly occurred during a period of strained relations between president trump and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell after congress ’ s failed attempts to repeal and replace obamacare during the summer of 2017 . on page 302 of fire and fury , wolff reports the following ( based , judging from the context , on information given him by former trump adviser steve bannon ): <PARA> that trump and mcconnell were on the outs in august 2017 is easily confirmed by looking back at press coverage of the time , not to mention president trump ’ s own tweets disparaging mcconnell ’ s leadership : <PARA> for his part , mcconnell loosed barbs aimed at trump ’ s inexperience in government . “ our new president , of course , has not been in this line of work before ,” he said on 7 august . “ i think he had excessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process .” <PARA> but , unlike wolff , even though they had heard about the majority leader ’ s haircut rebuke , journalists covering the so - called trump / mcconnell “ feud ” shied away from reporting it because it couldn ’ t be authenticated — as noted in this post - fire and fury tweet by washington post reporter ashley parker : <PARA> axios political reporter jonathan swan was among those who couldn ’ t find a source to corroborate the story : <PARA> reading between the lines , the source swan referred to was presumably steve bannon , whose interest ( at the time ) was defending president trump . that not a single other source would confirm it is a strong indication that the haircut rebuke story is apocryphal . <PARA> even stronger is this outright denial tweeted by mcconnell ’ s deputy chief of staff , don stewart : <PARA> in a follow - up statement to vox ’ s jen kirby , stewart said the entire incident was misreported by wolff :

false	on 26 december 2017 , a story raced across social media with a headline suggesting that united states president donald trump had said that firefighters and police officers make too much : <PARA> the bluedotdaily . com article attached to this claim refers to a controversial tax bill passed in late 2017 . a number of readers clearly only saw the headline and believed it to reflect a direct quote made by the president . however , the article went on : <PARA> nowhere in the article is any indication that trump said or even implied that police , firefighters , or any first responders make too much money . its actual focus was the taxpayers who used various “ miscellaneous deductions ” when filing their 2015 income tax returns , not whether any party involved said or implied police officers and firefighters were overpaid . ( the same provision was addressed in a previous snopes . com fact check involving misinformation about the effects of the 2017 tax bill .) <PARA> the blue dot daily article cited a piece from salon . com to bolster its claim , but that article mentioned law enforcement as only one example out of many : <PARA> tax preparation chain h & r block ’ s tax information center addressed three changes to itemized deductions introduced by the bill in a 22 december 2017 post , noting that the new act has eliminated or restricted many itemized deductions beginning in 2018 and raised the standard deduction : <PARA> despite headlines heavily implying that the president had said that police and firefighters in particular are overpaid , itemized deductions for all professions have been eliminated in favor of a higher standard deduction . all professions retain the option to itemize some deductions , but fewer are likely to do so , in part because the increased standard deduction would benefit more affected taxpayers than itemizing . <PARA> the claim moved across social media ( as so many do ) as in a game of telephone , with one editorial using police and firefighters as an example , and another essentially attributing a quote based on that example to the president .	
mixture	in mid - december 2017 , a viral story picked up by multiple news outlets and web sites reported that united parcel service ( ups ) refunded a $ 32 shipment fee to a family waiting for a $ 846 , 000 bank draft that never arrived : <PARA> the story was first reported by canadian network cbc on 14 december 2017 and although the first part of the story has been reported and aggregated by various outlets far and wide , the situation was resolved almost immediately when the bank issued the family a new check after the cbc story was published ten months after the ordeal began . <PARA> in february 2017 , ontario , canada resident lorette taylor was distributing inheritance money to her two siblings and when she went to her td canada trust branch , her family was told that the best way to send $ 846 , 648 . 46 to her brother was by bank draft ( i . e ., a check issued directly by a bank ). taylor told cbc that the branch assured her there was a procedure in place to recover the money if the draft was lost or stolen . <PARA> taylor ’ s brother , louis paul herbert , lives 273 miles from the family ’ s attorney ’ s office and told cbc he thought he could save himself the long drive by having ups ship the money to a nearby ups store , but ups lost the package carrying the funds . the family wrangled with the bank over the issue for almost a year and finally approached cbc in desperation . their plan to make their plight public worked : soon after the canadian news agency broke the story , the bank issued the family a new check , resolving the situation . <PARA> td canada trust spokeswoman barbara timmins assured us on 27 december 2017 that the family has received a replacement check and the situation has been resolved , saying : “ we recognize that there was more we could have done to come to a resolution faster .” <PARA> many of the headlines being shared by various publications seem geared to generate outrage clicks aimed at ups , and are worded more or less like this one in the new york post : “ after losing family ’ s $ 846k inheritance , ups offers to refund $ 32 shipping fee .” <PARA> it is unclear why ups should have been the target of outrage in this instance , as they didn ’ t issue the check and had no authority or responsibility to provide a replacement . after searching unsuccessfully for the package , ups sent the family a letter of apology and reimbursed their shipping costs , in accordance with the company ’ s terms and conditions of service ( which plainly state that customers are prohibited from shipping items worth more than $ 50 , 000 ). furthermore , unless customers take specific actions to inform them , ups employees usually have no way of knowing what is in packages they are delivering . <PARA> in the cbc story , herbert expressed remorse for having the money sent via ups rather than picking it up himself , saying that “ i should have just driven [ to the lawyer ’ s office ]. it ’ s something i kick myself in the rear over everyday .” <PARA> in response to the incident , ups sent out a statement that read : <PARA> timmins said the case has illustrated that many people don ’ t understand how bank drafts work . he noted that they do not expire and should be handled like cash in explaining why the bank was hesitant to reissue a new one after the original was lost :	
false	on 13 december 2017 , a self - described “ satire ” site posted a story falsely reporting that black voters in alabama had committed fraud by voting multiple times during a special election the night before , in which democratic candidate doug jones beat republican roy moore in a closely - watched and hotly - contested fight for the senate seat left vacant by united states attorney general jeff sessions . <PARA> the web site called reaganwasright . com reported : <PARA> nothing about this story is true — if readers scroll to the bottom of the page it bears a label declaring itself “ satire ,” although whether one finds its content funny is , of course , subjective : <PARA> the web site reaganwasright . com is associated with a network of sites run by christopher blair , who writes under various pseudonyms , including “ flagg eagleton .” although the stories on his sites ( which include the last line of defense , freedum junkshun , and as american as apple pie ) are labeled “ satire ,” they contain content many readers mistake as real , particularly when they are picked up and run by bottom - feeder aggregator sites that display no such labels or caveats . <PARA> the article in question is a compilation of slopped - together information that has no bearing in reality . the federal election commission oversees campaign finance , but it has no role to play in voting , voter access , or ballots . the “ quote ” supposedly taken from a breitbart . com report is falsified . according to the alabama secretary of state ’ s office ( which does oversee voting and ballots ), there have been no reports of widespread voter fraud . <PARA> in late october 2017 , blair apologized for another racially - charged story posted on freedum junkshun , which falsely reported u . s . army sgt . la david johnson , the “ black soldier ” who was killed in action along with three others when their patrol was ambushed in niger , was a deserter .	
false	in december 2017 , an image purportedly showing a c - span caption containing a crude insult aimed at sen . mitch mcconnell ( r - kentucky ) appeared on social media and was subsequently widely shared along with the claim that the screenshot was “ not photoshopped ”: <PARA> despite the fact that the phrase “ fake news ” has become nearly ubiquitous in american politics in 2017 , and despite the fact that trust in media is at an all - time low , the fact that a random person put up an image that was clearly digitally altered with the description “ not photoshopped ” was enough evidence that many people needed in order to believe that it was indeed real , perhaps the work of a disgruntled employee . <PARA> this image was created by <USER> and posted to twitter on 3 december 2017 . a watermark for this twitter user ’ s handle and web site ( bornmiserable . com ) is visible at the bottom right corner of the graphic . it ’ s difficult to read in the viral posting , but it ’ s clearly visible in <USER> original tweet : <PARA> this screengrab ( minus the caption ) was taken from a 7 november 2016 interview with mcconnell about potential changes to senate rules . in addition , <USER> altered the date to make it appear that the video had aired in 2017 . here ’ s a comparison of the doctored image ( left ) and the genuine video ( right ): <PARA> we also searched c - span ’ s archives to see if this video was rebroadcast on 7 november 2017 along with the offending “ caption .” it was not .	
false	on 3 december 2017 , the patriot post published a fake news article by “ flagg eagleton ,” a pseudonym frequently used to publish misinformation on disreputable “ satire ” web sites such as the last line of defense , our land of the free , freedum junkshun , as american as apple pie , and reagan was right , claiming that the jacksonville jaguars were the first national football league team to declare bankruptcy over “ kneeling thugs ”: <PARA> like the sites listed above , the patriot post ( which resides at the misspelled url potatriotpost . com ) is not a genuine news web site ; in addition to carrying a “ satire ” tag in its footer , the web site also explains in its “ about ” page that all of the content on the site is fictional . the web site also defends its own particular brand of satire , insisting that it does not publish “ fake news ” but instead a new genre ( which could perhaps be called “ fake fake news ”): <PARA> although the patriot post labels its content as fiction , its stories — like many of its ilk — are frequently republished on web sites that carry no such disclaimers . this story , for instance , was presented as a genuine news article with no disclaimer to speak of on the web site daily flash news , viral usa and right thing usa , making it less “ satire ” and more “ corrosive disinformation .” but regardless of where this story was shared or whether or not it should be classified as fake news , satire , or worse , the claim that the jacksonville jaguars filed bankruptcy over “ kneeling thugs ” is false . <PARA> the jacksonville jaguars have experienced relatively small crowds during the 2017 season , but the team did not announce that they were filing for bankruptcy .	
false	bob marley died of brain cancer in may 1981 , but a conspiracy theory has emerged in the ensuing three decades that the u . s . central intelligence agency infected the reggae singer with cancer five years earlier . in november 2017 , the disreputable web site your news wire , which has a history of publishing fake articles and sensationalist clickbait , added a new twist . <PARA> according to the article , oxley first confessed that the shooting of bob marley in kingston , jamaica , in 1976 was a cia assassination attempt and then said that the agent himself had followed up on it by tricking the singer into injecting himself with “ cancer viruses and bacteria ”: <PARA> your news wire did not provide a single source for the story , despite including extensive quotations from the supposedly dying oxley . the site also has a history of writing false articles , including ones about deathbed confessions from cia agents . we could find no record of a bill or william oxley having any association with the cia , and neither his name , the quotations attributed to him , nor the basic facts of your news wire ’ s story are corroborated anywhere else . <PARA> on 3 december 1976 , gunmen shot up marley ’ s home on hope road in kingston , jamaica , injuring the singer , his wife rita and his manager don taylor . the assailants were never formally identified or brought to justice . <PARA> however , some people in marley ’ s entourage believed the attackers were connected to edward seaga , an opposition politician , according to an account by vivien goldman , a journalist who knew marley and was his publicist during the 1970s . <PARA> at the time , tensions were rising between factions supportive of jamaica ’ s prime minister michael manley and his socialist people ’ s national party , who were sympathetic to fidel castro ’ s cuba , and edward seaga and his conservative jamaica labour party , who were sympathetic to the united states . <PARA> although marley had previously been explicitly supportive of manley , he organized the smile jamaica concert in a non - partisan effort to ease political tensions and inspire unity and peace . according to goldman , marley was angry at the prime minister when he rescheduled the 1976 general election to coincide with the concert , which gave the appearance that marley was backing manley . <PARA> there were reports in the 1970s that the cia was active in jamaica , that they attempted to destabilize manley ’ s government in 1976 , and even that they considered assassinating him . the agency denied those claims . <PARA> taylor also claimed that the cia had plotted to assassinate his client , but this conclusion appears to be based solely on the belief that “ the son of a prominent cia official ” had infiltrated a film crew at the december 1976 music festival . in his memoir marley and me , taylor wrote : <PARA> marley was shot in the arm and chest , but recovered quickly from his injuries and was able to perform at the smile jamaica festival two days later . this is where the “ shoe plot ” begins . <PARA> according to the theory , a mysterious american man visited marley as he prepared for the concert , which was to take place on 5 december . the man purportedly gave marley a pair of shoes , and when the singer tried on one of them , his toe was pricked by a copper wire or nail . <PARA> throughout the caribbean and central america more broadly , the cia is known to have been involved in political assassinations and regime changes , in particular in honduras and nicaragua , and the islands of jamaica and cuba are only a couple of hundred miles apart . <PARA> so the prospect of the cia seeking to establish jamaica as a bulwark against soviet and cuban influence in the region by neutralizing the populist folk hero bob marley , who was historically sympathetic to the socialist michael manley , is not inconceivable . however , there is a lack of concrete proof linking the cia to either the shooting of marley or the cancer that eventually killed him . <PARA> claims of weaponized cancer infection are part of a broader , long - running discussion about “ targeted assassinations ” by intelligence agents in the united states and elsewhere . most prominently , some adherents claimed that the cia was responsible for the cancer which claimed the life of venezuelan leader hugo chávez , in 2013 . <PARA> it might be possible to externally induce cancer in another person by infecting them with a virus known to cause cancer . marley developed skin cancer in his foot , which subsequently metastasized and developed into the brain cancer that eventually killed him , and it is conceivable that intentionally infecting a person with an immune - compromising virus such as hiv , could possibly cause them to develop skin cancer . <PARA> however , it is questionable whether this would be likely to be used as an assassination method . firstly , the precise mechanics of “ infecting ” someone with cancer are uncertain , meaning the desired end result , death caused by cancer , would be far from assured . <PARA> and while the ultimate cause of death , cancer , would certainly have the benefit of preventing suspicions , it can take years for a person to die from cancer . this would undermine one of the principle purposes of an assassination : to quickly stop an individual doing or saying something . <PARA> as implausible as the “ shoe plot ” might seem , the cia is known to have made a number of unorthodox political assassination attempts , against fidel castro in particular . <PARA> whether or not there was anything more to bob marley ’ s death than natural causes — and there is no solid evidence to the contrary — we can say with certainty that a cia agent named “ bill oxley ” did not confess while on his death bed in maine to assassinating the singer .	
false	a young iranian woman was placed at the center of online controversy in november 2017 after several news outlets reported that she had had extreme plastic surgery in order to look like angelina jolie . <PARA> the belgian news site sud info reported that sahar tabar had undergone “ 50 plastic surgery operations in just a few months ” and had lost 40 kilos ( around 88 pounds ) in an effort to physically resemble actress angelina jolie . <PARA> the story was quickly picked up by web sites in india , saudi arabia , and the u . s ., among other countries . although sud info listed tabar as being 22 years old , other sites have reported that she is only 19 . <PARA> while most reports on the subject relied on tabar ’ s official instagram account ( no longer available online ), which has amassed 447 , 000 followers , another instagram account using tabar ’ s name rebuffed the allegations that she had experienced as many as 50 surgeries in a 28 november post that stated : <PARA> tabar ’ s mention of technology and makeup suggested that her photographs might have been digitally altered and / or that she achieved the unusual look on display in online images in part through through the application of cosmetics or prosthetics . tabar ’ s post also asserted that those who have criticized her were merely displaying “ a show of jealousy and flames .” <PARA> critics have maintained in comments posted to her social media accounts that tabar is actually employing prosthetics in her photographs , a suspicion she confirmed in an interview published by the russian news outlet sputnik on 4 december 2017 . <PARA> according to tabar , she had only undergone three plastic surgeries : “ a nose , enlarged mouth and liposuction .” she also rebuked the idea that she set out to emulate jolie ’ s facial appearance : <PARA> the many articles about tabar leading up to her apparent confession did not contain any quote from a direct interview with her or a social media post from her affirming the number of surgeries she allegedly undertook , her purported dieting , or whether her actual motivation was to like the academy award - winning actress . a video posted by the british newspaper the sun , for example , captures tabar speaking farsi , but our translation of that video found in contained no mention of jolie . <PARA> like other “ viral ” stories , the report on tabar had spread without much in the way of sourcing , aided in part by her unique pictures . <PARA> postscript — in october 2019 , news accounts reported that tabar had been arrested by iranian authorities for ‘ blasphemy ’:	
false	as republican tax reform plans made their way through congress in the fall of 2017 , there were widespread concerns about the effect that the legislation could have on various groups . for example , fears that the house republican tax bill would force graduate students to count free tuition as income turned out to be merited . <PARA> a reader also contacted us to ask whether employee discounts would also be treated as taxable income under the republican plan . <PARA> the answer , as of 29 november 2017 , is no . employee discounts — meaning the discounts that a company offers to its own employees specifically for goods or services from that company — would not be taxed . <PARA> however , the most recent version of the tax cuts and jobs act ( brought before the senate on 28 november 2017 ) would make certain employee fringe benefits that were previously tax - exempt taxable . this means that , for example , if the tax bill were passed in its current form , an employee whose company pays for them to move house for work would have to count the value of those moving costs as part of their taxable income . <PARA> the legislation does this by removing paragraph six from section 132 ( a ) of the tax code . title 26 of the u . s . code ( the internal revenue code ) states that certain kinds of employee benefits ( known as “ fringe benefits ”) are not to be counted as taxable income . these include — among others — moving expenses reimbursement , free retirement planning services , and employee discounts . <PARA> however , neither the most recent version of the tax cuts and jobs act , nor any of the previous revisions of the bill , include a provision that removes the current allowance for employee discounts to be deducted from taxable income . <PARA> indeed , we could find only one source where this claim was made : a 3 november 2017 post on a blog run by the law firm davis polk . the firm subsequently confirmed to us that the house bill does not contain any provision that would remove the deduction for employee discounts , and that the blog post mentioned employee discounts because it was a preliminary examination of what was , at that time , unclear language in the bill .	
unproven	did leonardo da vinci — one of history ’ s great geniuses , and a prolific inventor , artist , architect and ‘ renaissance man ’ — have such humility and perfectionism that he actually apologized on his death bed for the lack of “ quality ” in his life ’ s work ? is it possible that the painter of the mona lisa and the last supper left this world feeling he had “ offended god and mankind ” with his deficiencies ? <PARA> these are the surprising implications of a quotation widely attributed to leonardo as his dying words . the quotation appears in social media memes , various compendiums of famous last words , and self - help guides . in november 2017 — perhaps inspired by the world record - breaking sale of “ salvator mundi ,” a painting of christ attributed to leonardo — the quotation got a new audience on social media , when it was shared by the history hustle facebook page : <PARA> in an alternative version of the quotation , leonardo is purported to have said “ i have offended god and mankind by doing so little with my life .” you can even buy a t - shirt featuring the words . <PARA> the original source of the quotation is a landmark text in art history : giorgio vasari ’ s 1568 collection of biographies , the lives of the most excellent painters , sculptors and architects ( in italian le vite de ’ più eccellenti pittori , scultori ed architettori ). <PARA> in it , vasari gives an account of leonardo spending his final moments in the company of king francis i of france , one of his primary patrons . notably , vasari does not actually attribute the words to leonardo as a direct quotation . here ’ s what he says , according to an 1879 edition of the book in the original italian : <PARA> and here ’ s the entire scene as translated into english by art historian herbert horne in 1903 ( page 44 : <PARA> so instead of a direct quotation from leonardo , we have a description of a conversation between leonardo and francis i by giorgio vasari , who was not present in the room . <PARA> vasari ’ s dramatic account of the humanist leonardo humbling himself before god before dying in the arms of a king inspired paintings by the french artists françois - guillaume ménageot and jean - august - dominique ingres ( below ). <PARA> however , its accuracy has been disputed by historians . <PARA> in his notes , herbert horne writes “ the story that leonardo expired in the arms of francis i has long been called into question .” in particular , horne points to the fact that leonardo died around easter 1519 at clos lucé (“ the chateau of cloux ”) near the central french city of amboise . at the time francis i ’ s court was in the royal palace at saint - germain - en - laye , around 140 miles north . <PARA> furthermore , horne writes that francesco melzi — a painter and pupil of leonardo , who became a confidant and the executor of his will — wrote to leonardo ’ s family to inform them of his death and bequests , but conspicuously said nothing about the purported presence of king francis i at the time of his passing . <PARA> according to gaetano milanesi , the art historian who edited the 1879 italian edition of vasari ’ s “ lives ,” francis i ’ s diary does not mention any visit to clos lucé at the time of leonardo ’ s death . milanesi also notes that vasari incorrectly stated da vinci ’ s age as 75 at the time of his death . in fact , he was 67 years old . this error does not enhance the credibility of vasari ’ s other claims . <PARA> a day before leonardo ’ s death on 2 may 1519 , king francis i issued a decree from saint - germain - en - laye , according to herbert horne . <PARA> however , the science writer michael white points to research by the 19th century historian aimé champollion , who stated that the decree was , in fact , signed by a chancellor in the absence of the king , leaving open the possibility that francis i had visited leonardo 140 miles away . <PARA> whether or not leonardo died in the king ’ s arms , there is further reason to dispute vasari ’ s description of their conversation . in leonardo : the first scientist , michael white points to vasari ’ s bias towards religiosity , which would undermine the objectivity of his account ( page 260 ): <PARA> in his 1888 translation of leonardo ’ s notebooks ( page 1112 ), the german art historian jean paul richter described vasari ’ s account of leonardo ’ s death in the arms of francis i as an “ incredible and demonstrably fictitious legend .” <PARA> he added that the description of leonardo regretting his lack of hard work was “ evidence of the superficial character of the information which vasari was in a position to give about leonardo .” <PARA> ultimately , we don ’ t know what leonardo da vinci ’ s last words were . but we do know that the quotation commonly attributed to him is a modified version of the description of a conversation written 50 years after his death by an unreliable historian .

mixture	on 11 november 2017 , youtube personality blaire white descended upon a “ refuse fascism ” anti - donald trump protest on hollywood boulevard ’ s walk of fame with the pretense of performing a social experiment in which she wore a trump hat whilst out and about in the supposed liberal mecca of los angeles ( although the walk of fame is regularly packed with tourists from all over the world ). <PARA> in the resulting roughly six - minute video , white claims she was assaulted twice , once at the anti - trump rally and again when a pedestrian threw what appeared to be a drink in her face . police told us white initiated an altercation at the rally by crossing a los angeles police department ’ s divider between pro - trump and anti - trump protesters . because she did not file a police report that night , it is unclear whether the incident with the drink was staged for the purpose of making a viral video ( which was then featured by popular conservative web sites like breitbart . com and infowars ). <PARA> white and her boyfriend joey sarson started their los angeles adventure that day in west hollywood , a city known for its high concentration of lgbt residents . after uneventfully walking the streets and even tipping a go - go dancer at the abbey bar while wearing the conspicuous “ make america great again ” cap , white concluded , “ the gays are pretty polite .” so the duo took the act to the walk of fame , presciently noting : <PARA> as sarson predicted , it was bad — probably because the pair conveniently wandered onto the boulevard donning their trump hats at a time when there was an anti - trump protest underway , claiming they didn ’ t know the event was scheduled , but somehow possessing clairvoyant knowledge of a looming fight . <PARA> in the video , which is heavily edited , the pair can be seen standing in front of a truck from which anti - trump protest leaders were rallying the crowd with microphones . although the video is blurry , it appears the two captured their attention . at one point , according to explainer text on the video , a protester snatches sarson ’ s red cap and throws it . the video then cuts to white grappling with a protester for the hat before being separated by a los angeles police officer . she then points out that one of her acrylic fingernails had been ripped off and was bleeding . <PARA> according to white ’ s video caption : <PARA> that is not exactly what happened , according to los angeles police lt . michael ling . he told us the protest was permitted in the area of hollywood boulevard and highland avenue ( in the heart of hollywood ) and that police had roped off a dividing line between pro - trump and anti - trump groups to keep them separated and to avoid violence . white and sarson crossed into the anti - trump crowd , which incited the physical contact seen in the video . ling said police helped white get up and and away from the area , and that she declined to file a police report or press charges . <PARA> later in the video , white was giving a rundown of what happened at the protest when a man walked by her and threw some sort of liquid in her face , resulting in smeared makeup around her eyes and cheeks . she did not file a police report about that incident either . ling said that detectives planned to follow up to see if she wishes to do so . although it is unclear whether this aspect of the video was also staged , it would not be the first of its kind . conspiracy theorist alex jones had coffee thrown in his face three months earlier in an apparent on - camera stunt . white ’ s video was featured by jones ’ conspiracy site infowars . <PARA> white is a youtube star with a following of 360 , 000 fans , who has made a name for herself with sensational videos like “ crashing a feminist march ,” “ black lives matter is trash ,” “ fat acceptance is stupid ,” and “ there are only 2 genders .” according to rationalwiki : <PARA> the video can be viewed in its entirety here :	
false	the chemical element potassium ( k ) is vital for the continued healthy functioning of your adrenal glands , which are located on top of your kidneys and composed of two parts , the medulla and the cortex . when properly functioning , the adrenal glands pump hormones out to your body in response to stress in your environment and also regulate the vital functions associated with these stress responses , such as switching on sweat glands to regulate body temperature , converting food into needed energy , regulating blood pressure , and triggering anti - inflammatory responses . <PARA> bananas have long been touted as an excellent source of dietary potassium , as that element is naturally present in the yellow fruit . bananas not only supply your body with needed potassium but also provide other beneficial effects , such as lubricating your digestive tract , keeping you regular , and protecting your intestines from ulcers and abrasive acids . <PARA> given all those positives , why would anyone be concerned about overdosing on bananas ? the answer is because there is too much of a good thing : hyperkalemia ( high potassium ) in a medical condition that can result from factors such kidney disease or failure , addison ’ s disease , alcoholism , heavy drug use , low red blood cell count ( from a severe injury or burn ), type 1 diabetes , or excessive use of potassium supplements . <PARA> however , is there really enough potassium in bananas that one need worry about the fatal effects of consuming too many of them ? it ’ s certainly a persistent belief , as demonstrated by the following video clip in which english travel show presenter karl pilkington repeats to comedian ricky gervais the claim that “ if you eat more than six [ bananas ], it can kill you ” ( which is why , supposedly , bananas aren ’ t sold in bunches containing more than six ): <PARA> working out the math shows there ’ s little cause for concern in this regard , though . the amount of potassium one takes in from eating a single banana is about 422 mg , while the recommended daily allowance ( rda ) of potassium for adults is about 4 , 700 mg per day . so the average adult could safely consume 11 bananas per day and still be taking in less potassium than is recommended as a healthy daily amount . <PARA> okay , but what if one is eating all those bananas at once , rather than spreading them out across the course of a day ? according to the linus pauling institute , “ oral doses [ of potassium ] greater than 18 grams taken at one time in individuals not accustomed to high intakes may lead to severe hyperkalemia , even in those with normal kidney function .” that amount of potassium is the equivalent of consuming about 42 bananas , in one sitting , a gastronomical feat far beyond the unforced capabilities of most people . <PARA> in fact , adverse effects of excessive consumption of potassium from food alone have never been documented . it is true that potassium from supplements or salt substitutes can result in hyperkalemia and possibly sudden death if excessively consumed by individuals with chronic renal insufficiency , but that ’ s not because potassium supplements are inherently dangerous . rather , about 90 % of potassium is excreted by the kidneys , so persons suffering from kidney disease ( or other renal complications ) have trouble excreting the excess potassium from potassium supplements to the point that it could reach dangerous levels if taken in excess . <PARA> so fear not that you might drop dead from having a few too many bananas . you ’ ll likely take in more potassium from eating foods such as avocados and yogurt than from bananas .	
false	veterans day ( known prior to 1954 as armistice day ) is a u . s . holiday that celebrates the service of all u . s . military veterans and is observed on november 11 to coincide with the date of the signing of the 1918 armistice that brought an end to hostilities in world war i . although annual presidential proclamations calling for the observance of armistice day on november 11 were not issued until 1926 , and armistice day was not designated as a u . s . federal holiday until 1938 , armistice day was first celebrated in 1919 : <PARA> each year on veterans day a national ceremony is held at arlington national cemetery ( usually attended by the president of the united states or , in his absence , another high government official ) which includes a wreath laying at the tomb of the unknowns . local observances typically include speeches from dignitaries , parades , moments of silence , and prayer ceremonies . <PARA> ravioli is a traditional italian food consisting of a filling enclosed within two layers of thin egg pasta dough , served in broth or with a pasta sauce . the type of ravioli most familiar to americans is a canned version filled with beef or processed cheese and served in a tomato - based sauce . <PARA> save for the fact that tinned ravioli was developed around the time of world war i , there is no connection between that food and veterans day , as asserted in a now common rumor : <PARA> the rumor that ravioli is a “ traditional meal ” on veterans day , a tradition initiated when president woodrow wilson supposedly served a ravioli dinner to 2 , 000 veterans who visited the white house on 11 november 1919 , originated with a spurious edit made to wikipedia ’ s article about veterans day on 11 november 2010 , which added the following paragraph : <PARA> none of the sources cited in that paragraph supported the historical notion of ravioli as a traditional veterans day meal , though . the first footnote simply referenced a 2009 article from the lebanon , ohio , western star newspaper that coincidentally mentioned ravioli was being served as part of the lunch menu at a local school on veterans day . the other footnote cited a page in the oxford companion to american food and drink that provided a source for woodrow wilson ’ s armistice day statement about hunger breeding madness rather than reform , and that mentioned how the rise in commercial canning after world war i had popularized americanized versions of ethnic dishes such as ravioli — but it offered no connection between those two topics . ( president wilson hosted no dinners for anyone at the white house in november 1919 , as he had suffered a debilitating stroke the previous month and remained in seclusion .) <PARA> the false information about a veterans day - ravioli connection persisted on wikipedia for exactly a year , until it was finally removed via another edit on veterans day 2011 . during that time , however , the apocryphal tale of president wilson ’ s purportedly initiating the tradition by serving a ravioli dinner to a group of veterans at the white house in 1919 was uncritically picked up and cited as fact by a number of other sources , such as a 2011 examiner . com article : <PARA> it may be the case that many americans eat ravioli on veterans day , but only because many americans eat ravioli on every other day of the year as well , not because president wilson once served it to some white house visitors .

false	of the countless adaptations made of h . g . wells ’ 1897 science fiction classic the war of the worlds over the past century , the one that remains most talked and written about to this day was orson welles ’ live radio broadcast on 30 october 1938 . it boasted a distinctly modern twist . keen on cementing his reputation as a theatrical wunderkind ( welles was on the cover of time magazine only months earlier ), the 23 - year - old actor - director reworked the plodding victorian narrative about a martian invasion of earth into a gripping faux newscast with real moments of shock and awe . <PARA> ( contrary to common nomenclature , welles ’ “ war of the worlds ” broadcast was not a “ hoax ” sprung on an unsuspecting audience . rather , the show was a regularly scheduled and announced episode of the mercury theatre on the air , a radio program dedicated to presenting dramatizations of literary works .) <PARA> a brief excerpt from the script by howard koch shows why welles ’ hour - long production of the war of the worlds is justly regarded as a mini - masterpiece of horror : <PARA> the broadcast was legendary overnight for supposedly having been too realistic and frightening for its audience . morning papers from coast to coast reveled in the “ mass hysteria ” it had caused — even the staid new york times , whose front - page headline blared , “ radio listeners in panic , taking war drama as fact “: <PARA> in providence , rhode island , “ weeping and hysterical women ” swamped the providence journal with calls asking for more details of the “ massacre .” <PARA> in pittsburgh , associated press reported , a man returned home in the middle of the broadcast and found his wife with a bottle of poison in her hand , saying , “ i ’ d rather die this way than like that .” <PARA> in san francisco , police fielded hundreds of calls from frightened listeners , including one man who wanted to volunteer to help fight the martian invaders . <PARA> when orson welles was asked to comment on the hysteria he was blamed for causing , he was incredulous . “ we ’ ve been putting on all sorts of things from the most realistic situations to the wildest fantasy , but nobody ever bothered to get serious about them before ,” he was quoted as saying . “ we just can ’ t understand why this should have such an amazing reaction . it ’ s too bad that so many people got excited , but after all , we kept reminding them that it wasn ’ t really true .” <PARA> wabc , which aired the program in new york , issued this statement one hour after the broadcast ended : <PARA> for decades , the conventional wisdom based on the sensationalized reporting of the time was that the mercury theatre broadcast had indeed spread mass hysteria from one end of the country to the other . by the 2000s , however , sociologists and historians were questioning the true severity of “ the war of the worlds panic .” w . joseph campbell , an american university professor of communication studies , observed in 2010 that the contemporaneous news coverage was “ almost entirely anecdotal and largely based on sketch wire service roundups that emphasized breadth over in - depth detail ”: <PARA> such data as exist about the listening audience that night support campbell ’ s thesis . the c . e . hooper ratings service reported that only 2 percent of national respondents were tuned into welles ’ broadcast on 30 october 1938 . the rest were either listening to something else ( most likely ventriloquist edgar bergen ’ s chase and sanborn hour , one of the most popular programs on radio ), or nothing at all . based on the network ’ s own audience survey , cbs executive frank stanton concluded that most americans didn ’ t hear the show . “ but those who did hear it ,” he added , “ looked at it as a prank and accepted it that way .” <PARA> recapping the event on its 75th anniversary in slate , media historians jefferson pooley and michael j . socolow pointed out that few , if any , of the anecdotal reports of hysterical reactions to the program were ever investigated and confirmed : <PARA> in addition to overblown press coverage , another reason the event went down in history as an instance of “ mass hysteria ” was the publication of a book in 1940 called the invasion from mars . written by princeton psychology professor hadley cantril , the book purported to explain the war of the worlds “ panic ” in sociological terms but suffered from being overly reliant on a skewed report hastily compiled six weeks after the broadcast . on the basis of the report , which jefferson and socolow say was “ tainted by the sensationalistic newspaper publicity ,” cantril estimated that one million listeners had been “ frightened ” by the show — an impossible number , based on every other known measure of the size of the listening audience . “ worse ,” jefferson and socolow wrote , “ cantril committed an obvious categorical error by conflating being ‘ frightened ,’ ‘ disturbed ,’ or ‘ excited ’ by the program with being ‘ panicked .'” <PARA> was a small percentage of listeners frightened — and a few even panicked , perhaps — by the war of the worlds on the night of the broadcast ? clearly , yes . many of those , it was determined afterwards , had tuned in late and missed obvious clues that it was fiction ( and a large percentage of those assumed the u . s . was under attack by germany , not mars ). but was it an instance of mass hysteria overtaking tens of thousands of people throughout the u . s .? the evidence shows otherwise .

that ’ s like ripping up a winning lotery [ sic ] ticket !” <PARA> some mainstream news outlets reported that campos had “ vanished ,” which implied he had disappeared entirely , leaving no trace behind . however , campos appears to have merely withdrawn from the public eye , while his current whereabouts remain privately known by some ( such as lvmpd ). <PARA> lvmpd officer larry hadfield told us that campos is not missing , and reiterated that paddock had no accomplices when he rained bullets down on the route 91 harvest festival . hadfield told us , flat - out : <PARA> david hickey , international president of the international union , security , police and fire professionals of america , the union that represents campos , told us the last time he saw the injured guard was the day of his scheduled interviews . hickey described campos as “ humble ” and wanting to get his story out so he could leave the traumatic events behind him : <PARA> but when hickey emerged from a meeting just hours before campos was scheduled to go on hannity ’ s show , he told us he discovered that the young man , along with another union member and a security guard protecting campos , had left : <PARA> we sent an inquiry to mandalay bay ’ s parent company , mgm resorts international , and they sent us the following statement , noting campos does not wish to be in the limelight : <PARA> campos taped an interview on the nbc talk show hosted by ellen degeneres which is set to air on 18 october 2017 . appearing with building engineer stephen schuck , previews show campos describing encountering gunfire in the hallway , feeling a burning sensation and noticing that he was wounded . <PARA> although campos ’ s guard detail created yet another thread to which amateur internet sleuths could cling , ryan graney , who represents the family of victoria soto — a teacher killed protecting her students during the 2012 sandy hook elementary massacre — told us it makes sense that campos , now the accidental target of conspiracy theorists and “ truthers ,” is under guard : <PARA> sandy hook “ truthers ” have been on a crusade to prove that the thoroughly covered and well - documented massacre of children was a “ false flag ” engineered by the government in the service of the “ new world order ,” a ubiquitous but vague conspiracy theory peddled by the likes of infowars host alex jones , in which a secret but powerful cabal seeks to institute an autocratic global regime which will only be enabled once the government has seized all the guns from americans . at least two “ truthers ” have been arrested for things like harassing or sending death threats to victims ’ families . <PARA> graney said those same “ truthers ” are currently whipping themselves into an online frenzy over campos : poring over photographs for supposed discrepancies , attempting to track his whereabouts , and scrutinizing a public database for the nevada private investigator ’ s licensing board ( a spokesman for the board told us that agency has no jurisdiction over casino security guards like campos ). <PARA> richard a . patterson , a founding partner of the law firm owen , patterson & owen , which has filed a petition to have the courts appoint a public administrator to oversee paddock ’ s assets in lieu of pending litigation on behalf of victims , told us that campos ’ s hesitance to speak to the media and maintain a low profile is not surprising : <PARA> this is not the first time a person ’ s lack of desire to speak to the media has been misconstrued as that person being “ missing .” for months in late 2016 , online conspiracy theorists set about searching for signs of eric braverman , a former clinton foundation executive officer they believed had disappeared due to nefarious activity by the clintons in an effort silence potential critics . after intense online speculation about his whereabouts , braverman surfaced in mid - january 2017 to publicly announce he was taking on a new job .	
false	on 8 october 2017 , thedailyberries . com published an article about a purportedly recent discovery of a <PARA> “ lost city ” called heracleion : <PARA> egypt ’ s lost , sunken city of thonis - heracleion ( dubbed “ atlantis ” by some publications ) is thought to have been subsumed by the mediterranean over time due to soil erosion and rising sea levels , and all but forgotten for several hundred years after that — until its rediscovery in 2000 . since then , it has been discussed , written about , and featured in museum collections . a non sequitur about “ garcinia cambogia ”, which appears to be a weight - loss pill , suggests that thedailyberries . com ’ s purpose is not to share information about this purported lost city , but instead to simply trick people into being exposed to advertisements for a dubious supplement . <PARA> the claim cites an september 2017 post by buzznicked . com , which again references a “ very recent ” find ( also includes a mention of “ garcinia cambogia ”): <PARA> some posts included an image of a diver measuring the leg of a statue , which appears in the july / august 2000 issue of print magazine ancient egypt and on the web site of french underwater archaeologist franck goddio , who originally rediscovered the sunken city : <PARA> it is true thonis - heracleion was excavated and its submerged ruins uncovered , but was first rediscovered in 2000 ; the story was repurposed into a clickbait - and - switch in an attempt to sell a questionable weight - loss supplement in 2017 .	
true	in the aftermath of the 1 october 2017 mass shooting in las vegas , the american public attempted to come to grips with the scale of gun violence in the united states . one oft - cited statistic posted in social media by “ the other 98 %” maintained that 1 . 3 million americans had been killed in all the wars in u . s . history , while 1 . 5 million americans had been killed by firearms ( in non - military use ) since 1968 alone : <PARA> nbc news reported similar figures : <PARA> different versions of this claim have been prominently offered in recent years by sources such as new york times columnist nicolas kristof in 2015 , and pbs newshour contributor and commentator mark shields in 2012 . <PARA> all these claims contain casual uses of the qualifier “ americans ” in reference to gun deaths , which is somewhat confusing because not everyone who has been killed by firearms in the united states was an american citizen , and official sources for gun death statistics do not offer breakdowns by nationality . therefore , we assume that “ americans ” is used here for rhetorical effect , rather than as a functional statistical category , and deal with the total number of gun deaths occurring in the united states since 1968 . similarly , according to the historian don h . doyle , the u . s . civil war saw around 543 , 000 foreign - born ( i . e ., immigrant ) soldiers fighting on the union side alone , so a significant number of civil war deaths might have involved non - american citizen combatants , but we ’ ll count them all as “ americans .” ( indeed , non - u . s . citizens have likely served and died fighting for the u . s . side in every american military conflict since the revolutionary war , but probably in much greater numbers during the civil war than any other .) <PARA> support for this claim often uses sources that relate only to combatant deaths in wars and do not include civilian or other non - combatant deaths ( the latter being figures which might also include non - u . s . citizens ). one could argue that civilian deaths in wars should be included ( although estimates of these deaths are much less reliable than for fatalities among military personnel ), but we are limiting our analysis to include only combatant deaths in military conflicts . <PARA> we ’ ll break this analysis into two parts : the total number of deaths in the united states involving firearms since 1968 , and the number of deaths in the u . s . and among american combatants across all wars in american history . <PARA> gun deaths <PARA> the estimated total number of firearms - related deaths from 1968 - 2016 is 1 . 58 million . the official number for 1968 - 2015 is 1 . 55 million , and we have assumed the number of deaths in 2016 as being the mid - point between the two previous years ( 2014 and 2015 ). <PARA> in most cases , the source of these figures is the centers for disease control ’ s ( cdc ) web - based injury statistics query and reporting system ( wisqars ). for figures from 1968 to 1991 , we consulted the cdc directly <PARA> deaths in wars <PARA> for combatant fatalities , our main source is an april 2017 summary published by the department of veterans affairs , which lists the following figures : <PARA> the civil war trust , a non - profit organisation primarily dedicated to preserving american battlefields , estimates that around 6 , 800 people died in battle during the revolutionary war , with an additional 17 , 000 deaths caused by disease , and between 8 , 000 and 12 , 000 more deaths occurring among those held as prisoners of war . the upper end of this estimate range , then , would put the total number of deaths associated with the american revolutionary war at 26 , 800 . <PARA> similarly , the civil war trust estimates that around 15 , 000 americans died during the war of 1812 , a significantly higher number than the 2 , 260 battle deaths estimated by the department of veterans affairs . <PARA> the civil war is an interesting case . based on from the work of two late 19th and early 20th century historians , the widely accepted figure for deaths in this conflict was reckoned as 618 , 222 for about a century . in 2011 , however , j . david hacker ( then of binghamton university ) published a significant upwards revision of that total , estimating that the likely death toll was between 650 , 000 and 851 , 000 . taking the mid - point in this estimate range assumes about 750 , 000 combatant deaths for the civil war . because of the enhanced statistical sophistication involved in hacker ’ s research , and what appears to be acceptance and support of his estimate among historians , we are going to use 750 , 000 as the estimated death toll among combatants in the civil war . <PARA> figures for the global war on terror are taken from the department of defense ’ s defense casualty analysis system and are valid as of october 2017 . <PARA> afghanistan war : <PARA> iraq war : <PARA> if we rely on the department of veterans affairs summary , while accepting j . david hacker ’ s 750 , 000 estimate for the civil war , the total number of deaths among american combatants in all u . s . military conflicts , using high estimates for each , is thus 1 , 481 , 862 — about 100 , 000 less than the total number of firearms - related fatalities in the u . s . between 1968 and 2016 . <PARA> so even using the higher end of available estimates for war deaths throughout american history , the grand total of those deaths is still lower than the total of firearms - related fatalities since 1968 , a period of just 49 years . although this disparity between war deaths and gun deaths is smaller than the gap claimed by the other 98 % ( 200 , 000 ) or nbc news ( 300 , 000 ), the imprecision of casualty estimates ( especially for the civil war era ) allows for a considerable margin of error .	
false	donald trump ’ s well - documented hatred for cnn fed a rumor in october 2017 that , upon checking at his washington , d . c . hotel , guests were being asked to sign a petition against showing the news network on tvs in federal buildings . <PARA> this rumor appears to have originated from a single facebook post that has either been deleted or made private . on 10 october 2017 , twitter user <USER> posted a screenshot purportedly showing the original post and claimed that a “ friend ” had received the flyer when she checked in to the trump hotel : <PARA> we identified and interviewed the woman pictured in this facebook post . she told us that she was never actually a guest at the trump hotel in washington d . c . she did , however , use facebook ’ s “ check in ” feature when she stopped in for a few drinks at the lobby bar . while she was there , an anonymous person handed her the flyer . she said : <PARA> the original facebook post did not claim that hotel staff had handed out the flyer or that every guest received it at check - in . yet , as the image spread on social media , the claim was exaggerated . <PARA> the original facebook poster also told us that she did not know twitter user <USER> whose tweet pushing this rumor garnered more than 10 , 000 retweets : <PARA> when we asked a spokesperson for the hotel whether guests were receiving the fliers at check - in , we were told : <PARA> this flyer does detail a real petition on whitehouse . gov ( it has just over 50 signatures as of this writing ). anyone can create a whitehouse . gov petition . <PARA> finally , if the petition was indeed being handed to every guest at the hotel ( or even every customer at the lobby bar ), it would likely have been posted multiple times . yet we have only come across a single image of the document , indicating that this was likely an isolated incident .

unproven	two conservative radio hosts alleged on 28 september 2017 that members of the oakland raiders may purposefully put quarterback derek carr in harm ’ s way for not taking part in a protest carried out by several black players — a claim later picked up by several web sites . <PARA> hosts jack armstrong and joe getty claimed to have “ insider information ” concerning the performance of the raiders ’ offensive line — the only one in the national football league comprised entirely of african - american players — in a 27 - 10 loss to washington four days earlier . <PARA> according to armstrong and getty , an “ extremely reliable ” source on the team divulged to them that the offensive linemen allowed carr to be sacked ( tackled before he could throw the ball ) in retaliation for his refusal to join them in protesting during the playing of the national anthem before the game . <PARA> carr was sacked four times during the game , which armstrong and getty claim is outside the norm . getty first claimed that carr ( who is white ) was sacked once during the 2016 season before amending his argument : <PARA> in reality , carr was sacked 16 times during the previous season — one of which resulted in a season - ending broken fibula . in 2015 he was sacked 31 times , and in 2014 it happened 24 times . <PARA> armstrong added : <PARA> the hosts stated several times that they did not know if the allegations of “ deep route ” ( as they called their alleged source ) were true . according to them , however , the source claimed to have heard an offensive line member say of carr , “ if he wants to stand alone for the national anthem , he can stand alone on the field .” <PARA> armstrong said : <PARA> getty added : <PARA> however , the two hosts mentioned several times that the allegation had not been verified . <PARA> willard ogan , the assignment manager for comcast sportsnet bay area — one of several local news outlets that regularly covers the team — scoffed at the pair ’ s story . he told us : <PARA> he added that there was a logical flaw in the argument that carr ’ s offensive line willfully let him be sacked : <PARA> regarding the allegation that a team official had threatened to cut off access to the team for an unnamed reporter , ogan said that the raiders have never threatened to “ blackball ” his station : <PARA> most of the team , including the offensive line ( but not carr ), took part in a protest before the game , an offshoot of former san francisco quarterback colin kaepernick ’ s decision to kneel during the anthem prior to games during the 2016 season to protest extrajudicial killings carried out by police against communities of color . u . s . army veteran nate boyer has confirmed that he helped kaepernick decide to carry out his protest in that format , rather than sitting during the anthem . <PARA> raiders offensive tackle donald penn said that their demonstration was a direct response to president donald trump ’ s call in september 2017 for nfl owners to fire any player who took part . penn said : <PARA> he also said : <PARA> penn ’ s linemate marshall newhouse , however , attributed the protest to a wider range of issues : <PARA> tackle kelechi osemele also faced accusations on his instagram page that he and his linemates allowed carr to be sacked . he responded : <PARA> when asked whether the protest had an impact on the raiders ’ performance , carr said : <PARA> the offensive line did not repeat the protest during the team ’ s following game in denver on 1 october 2017 . only one player on either squad — oakland running back marshawn lynch — sat during the anthem , as he has done throughout the 2017 season . <PARA> carr suffered an injury after being sacked during the 1 october game . he was initially expected to miss between two and six weeks of action . but ogan told us that he took part in the team ’ s regular practice on 5 october 2017 . <PARA> we contacted both the raiders and the national football league seeking comment on armstrong and getty ’ s allegations . we also contacted several other media outlets in the bay area about the duo ’ s allegation that the team threatened to “ blackball ” a local reporter . we had not received a response by press time .

false	with puerto rico experiencing a humanitarian and infrastructural crisis in the aftermath of a series of hurricanes , a flurry of stories appeared at the end of september 2017 falsely claiming that a local union representing truck drivers had gone on strike , using the devastation to leverage an improvement in their pay and working conditions . <PARA> on 30 september 2017 , the conservative treehouse blog quoted extensively ( but selectively ) from comments given to the huffington post by united states air force colonel michael valle : <PARA> the conservative treehouse then went on to claim , again falsely , that the cause of this shortfall in truck drivers was a deliberate , coordinated strike action by the local teamsters union . similar claims were also made by the gateway pundit and entrepreneur kambree kawahine koa . <PARA> the international brotherhood of teamsters rejected these claims entirely , telling us the reports were “ fake news ” and adding that the teamsters local 901 in puerto rico was “ doing everything but refuse to help ” in relief efforts . <PARA> in a statement , teamsters general president jim hoffa called the reports “ nothing but lies ”: <PARA> on 29 september 2017 , the international brotherhood of teamsters issued a plea for help to members throughout the mainland united states , describing the efforts being made by local truck drivers in puerto rico , in the face of infrastructural devastation : <PARA> indeed , colonel michael valle — one of the sources cited by the conservative treehouse — went on to tell the huffington post : <PARA> a cnbc report cited in the conservative treehouse post also undermines the claim that there was a strike . as the reporter explains : <PARA> contrary to all this , the conservative treehouse claims that the local teamsters union , which the article ( again , falsely ) identifies as frente amplio , “ is refusing to move the product .” a spokesperson for the international brotherhood of teamsters confirmed that frente amplio is an independent truck drivers ’ union in puerto rico and is not affiliated with the teamsters in any way . <PARA> in any event , the conservative treehouse cites a wapa tv interview with victor rodriguez , president of frente amplio , as evidence of a strike by truck drivers . in fact , it is evidence of no such thing . in the interview , rodriguez criticizes puerto rico ’ s governor ricardo rosselló for a law he signed in april that changed how truck drivers obtain permits , but he does not declare strike action or a refusal to work on the part of frente amplio members . he says : <PARA> rodriguez states that his organization had actually called off a planned strike before the arrival of hurricane irma , which caused widespread infrastructural damage to puerto rico in early september . <PARA> at one point , rodriguez does point to the power and leverage held by his members , saying : <PARA> however , he does not declare a strike or refusal to work and affirms “ the truckers are going to work ,” in this exchange with wapa tv ’ s eliezer ramos : <PARA> puerto rico ’ s teamsters local 901 are not on strike or refusing to work , and they are in fact pleading with truck drivers on the united states mainland to help in the distribution of fuel and supplies there . <PARA> the conservative treehouse ’ s claims about this are based on cherry - picked quotes from a united states air force colonel and a cnbc reporter , both of whose full remarks make clear that truck drivers in puerto rico are hampered by severe problems with infrastructure and distribution , but are not refusing to work . <PARA> on 2 october 2017 , a government spokesperson also refuted the rumor in an interview posted by cbs news reporter david begnaud on twitter saying , “ everyone ’ s working and the supplies are getting to where they have to .”

true	amid political controversy engendered by the protests of national football league athletes who refused to stand during pre - game renditions of the national anthem in late september 2017 to display solidarity with black victims of police violence — a gesture supported by many democrats but condemned by president trump and conservative republicans — a meme was circulated via social media making the point that the democratic party was not always a standard bearer for racial equality . <PARA> this is an example from twitter : <PARA> the centerpiece of the post is a reproduction of an illustration captioned “ dem party logo until 1966 ,” featuring a drawing of a crowing rooster and the slogan “ white supremacy , for the right .” and although the description is somewhat misleading (“ white supremacy ” was never a slogan of the national democratic party , for example , nor have we seen evidence that the image was “ purged from the internet ”), this was , in fact , the emblem of the alabama democratic party between 1904 and 1966 . <PARA> first , regarding the rooster , it ’ s often mistakenly assumed that the donkey was always the symbol of the democratic party , when in fact the party began using a crowing rooster as its mascot around 1840 . this version of how that came to pass is from a biographical sketch of indianapolis lawyer and whig politician thomas d . walpole published in 1876 : <PARA> other sources grant full credit to joseph chapman for dreaming up the rooster symbol , but in any case , although it was never officially adopted as the emblem of the national democratic party , it very quickly became an unofficial one and remained so until cartoonist thomas nast ’ s depictions of republicans as elephants and democrats as donkeys captured the public imagination in the late nineteenth century ( to date , the national democratic party has never officially adopted any animal as its symbol ). <PARA> the forerunner of today ’ s democratic party was born during the 1820s and ’ 30s , coalescing around the populist presidential candidacy of national war hero and southern slaveholder andrew jackson . although egalitarianism and freedom of the individual were much - touted ideals of “ jacksonian democracy ,” in reality the democratic party of the time took white supremacy for granted and had little to no interest in defending the freedom and equality of african americans , native americans , or any other racial minorities . still , the party was conflicted over the expansion of slavery and split in two during the 1860 elections , with the northern democrats opposing expansion and southern democrats favoring it . the democratic party remained dominant in the south after the civil war , opposing reconstruction and enacting laws to suppress black voters and enforce racial segregation . <PARA> the alabama democratic party went further than most , calling for the adoption of a new state constitution in 1901 that explicitly disenfranchised black voters , and celebrating its success in that effort by officially embracing the slogan “ white supremacy ” three years later . the monroe journal of claiborne , alabama reported on 2 june 1904 : <PARA> to be sure , there were a few alabama democrats who objected to the emblem after its adoption , though not for the reasons you might suppose . for example , democratic congressman j . thomas heflin was perfectly fine with the racist slogan , but felt the image of the rooster was undignified : <PARA> dignified or not , that emblem would appear at the top of every alabama state ballot for many decades to come , as noted , for example , in this november 1940 report by the chicago tribune : <PARA> by the early 1950s , however , the alabama democratic party ’ s proud embrace of white supremacy was becoming a liability for the national party . in 1952 , new york gov . thomas dewey , a republican campaigning on behalf of dwight d . eisenhower , gave a speech laying the racist logo at the doorstep of eisenhower ’ s democratic rival adlai stevenson ( from the dixon evening telegraph , 9 october 1952 ): <PARA> though the democrats lost that election , the emblem would remain intact on the ballot for another 14 years , until leaders of the alabama democratic party finally modified the slogan in 1966 for purely pragmatic reasons : the party needed “ negro ” voters . the montgomery advertiser reported : <PARA> ironically ( though the irony may well have been lost on mckay ), it was only because the voter suppression measures instituted decades earlier by his own state party had been knocked down by the voting rights act of 1965 that many of those potential new black voters would even have access to the polls . <PARA> as to the alabama democratic party rooster , it , too , was finally sent into forced retirement , but not till 1996 ( 30 years later ), when it was replaced by the image of a donkey .	
false	in the days immediately following hurricane irma making landfall in florida in early september 2017 , many floridians lost electrical power — including those with solar panels . shortly after the powerful storm hit , the alternative weekly newspaper miami new times offered an explanation as to why those with solar panels , who seemingly should be unaffected by a utility grid failure so long as there is sunlight , were also , quite literally , in the dark . <PARA> in a 14 september 2017 article , the new times reported that thanks to lobbying , the utilities company florida power & light ( fpl ) had so much undue leverage over when and whether customers could make use of solar panels that they were able to prevent solar users from accessing sun - based electricity in irma ’ s aftermath . the new times reported : <PARA> although the “ big corporate government / axis of evil ” narrative was too juicy for many conspiracy sites to pass up , floridians are not , in fact , mandated by law to connect solar panels to the power grid . utility providers are instead required to allow customers to connect their solar panels to the grid for “ net metering ,” meaning they can enjoy lower utility bills if their homes generate more power than they use , because excess power is sold back to the utility company . florida statute actually makes it unlawful for any entity block residents from having solar panels . <PARA> further , fpl doesn ’ t “ mandate ” that solar panels power down if the grid goes offline in a crisis . this is a safety precaution and industry - wide standard put in place to prevent line workers from being electrocuted while restoring power during an outage — and it is not unique to florida . the “ mandate ” cited by the new times is in fact a guideline which reflects this standard and includes an important caveat . the guideline reads ( emphasis added ): <PARA> we asked patrick altier , owner of the florida - based energy company solar trek , to explain further . altier told us that floridians who have solar panels on their homes can use energy from the sun during a grid failure — if they purchase additional equipment to prevent volts of electricity from traveling through power lines and harming unsuspecting neighbors or repair crews . to illustrate this , he gave us two scenarios : <PARA> the reason many homeowners don ’ t have the additional equipment necessary to allow them to keep their power on when the grid is down is because of the purchasing cost , said mark bubriski , director of public affairs for fpl . however , if customers have installed a battery system , such as a tesla powerwall or an sma sunny island , they can use their solar panels safely during a grid failure . no laws or mandates prohibit them from doing so . <PARA> conspiratorial theorizing about living off - grid is not new and tends to be popular , perhaps because it plays on the always - present american distrust of both governmental and corporate overreach . that perhaps explains why the new times story struck a nerve — it reports , for example , that “ fpl is ... allowed to disconnect your panels from the grid without warning you . the company can even put a padlock on it .” it also reports that utilities companies can “ charge a $ 400 or $ 1 , 000 application fee for consumers who want to install systems more powerful than 10 kilowatts .” <PARA> these are not misleading characterizations , but they make mundane operations seem ominous , bubriski said . technically , fpl can shut off power without warning for safety reasons , such as in the case of a fire or other hazard . fpl can also padlock certain inverters on large systems with manual shutoff switches to ensure the only ones able to access it are fpl workers . he also explained that the application fees , particularly the higher ones , wouldn ’ t affect most customers because the tiered fees only come into play for systems twice the size of the average florida home . <PARA> that is not to say fpl hasn ’ t been criticized — and as with any topic of public interest , there are legitimate concerns to be raised . for example , some have criticized the speed with which fpl restored power after irma ( as of 25 september 2017 , all fpl customers who lost power during irma have been brought back online ). and fpl and the local industry at large have been dragged for drafting what critics call favorable legislation . these stories , however , aren ’ t as clickable as the big - government - big - corporate conglomerate robbing the american public of free energy , which may explain why that is the one that made national headlines despite its mendacity .	
mixture	on 18 september 2017 , facebook user nik mathias posted a photograph of a child looking out a window on kinnick stadium , home of the iowa hawkeyes ( the university of iowa ’ s football team ) along with the following claims : <PARA> the ui stead family children ’ s hospital was not built by the hawkeyes football team , but it is owned and run by the university of iowa in iowa city . although “ hawkeyes ” can sometimes be used to refer to students , faculty or alumni of the university of iowa , it most commonly refers to the football team . this — combined with the text and photographs in nik mathias ’ facebook post — led many readers to believe the football team , not the university , had built the hospital . <PARA> it was opened in february 2017 . further , the hawkeyes have indeed started a new ritual of waving and applauding for children after the first quarter of home games , as this brief espn report explains :	
false	a photograph purportedly showing a 30 - foot wave crashing down on jennette ’ s pier in nags head , north carolina was circulated on social media in september 2017 as hurricane jose approached the east coast of the united states : <PARA> this is not a genuine photograph . this image was created by photographer alex lex , and a faint watermark can be spotted in the upper - right corner of the image ( circled in red in the image below ). although lex presented this image as if it were genuine when he posted it to his facebook page , this image has been manipulated . <PARA> this image may appear authentic at first glance , but a closer inspection revealed one glaring error : a calm horizon line can still be seen beneath the pier . if this wave truly was crashing down on jennette ’ s pier , it would be impossible to see the horizon ( as it would require the waves to the left of the pier to be invisible ): <PARA> furthermore , the “ 30 - foot ” wave shown in this image was actually taken from a second photograph . ferenc sohajda took the original wave photograph , which he uploaded to flickr in 2010 , saying he captured the image off the coast of india . <PARA> here ’ s a comparison of the fake jennette ’ s pier photograph ( left ) and the original wave photograph ( right ): <PARA> jennette ’ s pier explained on facebook the viral picture did not accurately depict the waves that hit the pier during the storm :	
false	a blind man named james crane , a golden retriever called daisy , the selfless rescue of almost a thousand people from one of the collapsing world trade center towers — if it all sounds too good to be true , that ’ s because it is , despite the opening line of the following example : <PARA> this is a case of the heroic rescue that wasn ’ t : this widely circulated internet tale of canine courage is pure fiction . no dog , of any type or name , rescued several hundred people from the world trade center towers on 9 / 11 . one of this fictional item ’ s more obvious tipoffs was the claim that the imaginary dog went to the 112th floor of the damaged tower to retrieve more victims in need of rescuing — an impossibility , as both world trade center towers topped out at 110 floors . <PARA> one version of the internet forward concluded with “ copied from new york times 9 - 19 - 01 .” that claim is as fake as the rest of the piece : no such article ran in the new york times or in any other publication , on that date or any other . <PARA> at least two men were guided to safety from the world trade center buildings by their guide dogs : michael hingson from the 78th floor by roselle , and omar rivera from the 71st floor by salty . neither dog returned to those buildings to rescue others , though . <PARA> roselle and salty received a joint dickin medal for their actions on 9 / 11 , as did a nypd search and rescue dog named appollo , but no dog was given the “ canine medal of honor of new york ” ( an award that does not exist ) by new york mayor rudy guilaini in connect with the 9 / 11 attacks . <PARA> the horror that was september 11 was hard for many of us to accept at the time , thus the need for “ miraculous rescue ” tales such as this one ... even if they had to be invented .	
false	in september 2017 , facebook users spread several rumors about government benefits and assistance available to florida residents in the aftermath of hurricane irma . one of these rumors involved the provision of food stamps for floridians whose homes had experienced power outages of at least two hours in duration . <PARA> a typical expression of the rumor read as follows : <PARA> a similar rumor claimed that the federal emergency management agency ( fema ), rather than the state of florida , was overseeing food stamp benefits : <PARA> a separate but related rumor held that fema was directly providing floridians with $ 500 for food purchases : <PARA> none of these rumors was quite right , and they all seemed to be based on misunderstandings of a federal disaster relief program known as disaster - snap ( or d - snap ), which was extended to parts of florida on 22 september 2017 . <PARA> d - snap is a program that temporarily extends the benefits usually available under snap ( supplemental nutrition assistance program , commonly known as food stamps ) to individuals affected by natural disasters . one does not have to be an existing recipient of snap benefits in order to qualify for d - snap , but the latter program does incorporate maximum income limits . d - snap assistance typically lasts for one month , but agriculture secretary sonny perdue announced on 22 september that the program would be in place for two months in florida . <PARA> recipients are provided with a temporary ebt card containing an amount of credit based upon household size and income . <PARA> a one - person household with a gross monthly income of $ 1 , 664 or less would receive $ 194 in d - snap credit for one month ( a figure that may be the source of the “$ 197 per person ” claim in some facebook rumors ). an eight - person household ( provided it has a gross monthly income of $ 4 , 151 or less ) would be eligible to receive $ 1 , 169 in d - snap assistance ( an average of $ 146 per person ). a two - person household ( provided it met the income requirements ) would be eligible for $ 357 in benefits , or $ 179 . 50 per person . ( there is no set benefit amount per person , a common element of the rumors which is misleading .) <PARA> the extension of d - snap in florida applies to certain counties . a county is considered eligible based upon the percentage of power outages experienced over a period of 72 hours , as well as the level of structural and flood damage suffered . <PARA> so power outages do play a role in the provision of extended snap benefits , but only on the county level . such benefits come with no requirement that an individual household must have experienced a power outage for “ more than two hours ,” or that applicants must provide photographic evidence of such outages . <PARA> the appropriate place to apply for disaster - snap assistance in florida is the access florida web page . <PARA> other assistance is available <PARA> as well as disaster - snap , existing food stamp recipients can avail themselves of certain other enhanced benefits in light of the damage and disruption caused by hurricane irma . <PARA> according to the united states department of agriculture ’ s food and nutrition service , which oversees snap , regular florida recipients can ( as of 12 september 2017 ) temporarily use ebt cards to buy hot food ( something they cannot normally do ) and should have received their monthly allotment earlier than usual in september : <PARA> in addition to these modifications , several types of federally - provided assistance are available to those affected by disasters such as hurricanes irma and harvey , both in florida and in other states . these benefits include monetary assistance with rent and home repairs as well as funeral and medical care costs , as well as direct assistance such as fema ’ s entering into lease agreements with owners of multi - family rental properties and performing repairs , with the aim of providing temporary accommodation for individuals . <PARA> variations in eligibility , rates of payment , duration of assistance , and type of assistance mean that it ’ s virtually impossible to say how much an individual household or person might receive . residents of states that have been affected by hurricanes and other disasters can check whether they are eligible for federal assistance , and apply for such assistance , by visiting disasterassistance . gov . <PARA> the claim asserted in one of the facebook rumors , that fema is offering individuals $ 500 via direct deposit to be used for purchasing food , has a grain of truth to it . <PARA> as part of the assistance that the federal government provides to individuals and households in state where major disasters have been declared ( as was the case in florida ), individuals who have lost their homes or been displaced can apply for what ’ s known as critical needs assistance , which consists of a one - time payment of $ 500 , as explained by fema : <PARA> however , the state must first ask fema to authorize critical needs assistance in specific counties particularly badly hit by a disaster , fema must then grant that authorization , and the individual must go through an application process . fema has authorized critical needs assistance in certain florida counties , which are listed on the fema web site . <PARA> the critical needs assistance application is available only to individuals who have lost their homes or been displaced , and who had previously resided in counties where fema has authorized critical needs assistance .	
false	in september 2017 , a viral rumor spread on facebook , reporting that the waters in southeast texas had tested positive for a variety of potentially harmful contaminants and diseases . <PARA> the message typically read : <PARA> we contacted officials in various local authorities in the cities and counties specified in the facebook post , and none were familiar with any tests being conducted for the contaminants and diseases listed . on 5 september , the city of beaumont ’ s public health department issued a statement in response to the rumor : <PARA> a spokesperson for the texas department of state health services also told us that the department was not familiar with any test results indicating the presence of mrsa ( bacteria that can cause skin infections and sepsis ) or typhoid fever . <PARA> the spokesperson warned , however , that the public should avoid entering floodwaters , if possible : <PARA> similarly , an 11 september 2017 statement by the texas commission on environmental quality warned about the potential dangers presented by floodwaters : <PARA> there is no evidence of floodwaters in southeast texas testing positive for the diseases and contaminants claimed in the viral facebook post , and the local and state officials we contacted did not express any familiarity with any such testing . <PARA> although there is no evidence that floodwaters in southeast texas have tested positive for the diseases and contaminants claimed in the facebook post , that doesn ’ t mean that future testing won ’ t reveal such a contamination — or that the floodwater is safe . <PARA> we know from testing organized by cnn and the new york times that floodwaters in the houston area have tested positive for exceptionally high levels of e . coli and sewage contamination . <PARA> houston is around 100 miles from the locations mentioned in the viral facebook post .	
false	on 3 september 2017 , the satirical web site asamericanasapplepie . org , playing off the recurrent “ creeping sharia ” conspiracy theory , posted a fake story reporting that the muslim mayor of the fictional town of blairsville , michigan had “ outlawed ” christmas in the city as of 2017 : <PARA> for starters , there is no suburb of dearborn , michigan called blairsville , and the photograph used in the story to depict a supposed christmas - banning muslim cleric is actually an associated press photograph of mohammad qatanani , the leader of a mosque in new jersey who has been in the news because he has been fighting potential deportation . <PARA> it is clear from asamericanasapplepie . org ’ s “ about ” page that it is a satire site that is not meant to be taken literally : <PARA> whether one thinks the content of the site is funny is subjective , but the post seems intended to play off anti - muslim sentiments and ongoing fearmongering over an alleged “ war on christmas ”, which is recycled in one form or another every year despite a consistent lack of evidence to support its assertions . <PARA> predictably , despite the fact the story is satire and its details completely fictional , people posted it to social media with anti - muslim commentary like this , for example :	
unproven	on 10 september 2017 , a now - viral video posted to facebook by wendy wilkerson underwood contained claims that the red cross in houston , texas was instructed to throw out a significant quantity of food and supplies donated by the public in the aftermath of hurricane harvey : <PARA> in the video , the camera pans over a pile of food , bags , and crates in what appears to be a garage , while the woman narrating it reiterates that it consisted of donations to the organization that had been discarded . no additional information is given . according to the person who narrated the video , the director of the red cross in houston said this was done “ because they can get more for florida .” the narrator also says that that the items shown in the video include 600 brand new , donated blankets and 500 pounds of dog food . <PARA> but red cross spokesperson elizabeth penniman denied in a statement that any such order had been given : <PARA> penniman added that the organization had attempted to contact underwood : <PARA> the red cross also released a lengthy statement about the matter ( although without directly addressing these specific claims ): <PARA> the organization does sometimes discard items that have been donated , but there is no evidence that it does so indiscriminately or on a large scale , and it only throws out supplies that are unusable for one reason or another , according to penniman : <PARA> while it remains unclear whether these were actually discarded donations or just a pile of somebody ’ s storm - damaged possessions in a garage , a 2016 cbs report highlights the fact that many well - intentioned charitable contributions are of no use to disaster relief efforts and are often thrown away as a result :	
unproven	after the solar eclipse that crossed the united states on 21 august 2017 , several national and international news organizations reported that people had applied sunscreen to their eyes in the mistaken hope of avoiding damage during the eclipse . <PARA> for example , fox news reported “ health professionals report cases where people put sunscreen on their eyeballs to watch eclipse .” forbes magazine wrote “ for the eclipse , people put sunscreen on their eyeballs ” and in the uk , the independent wrote “ eclipse 2017 : people treated for putting sun tan lotion on eyeballs to watch solar event ”. all of these stories depend on one thing : the unverified account of a single person in one location who related what a colleague had purportedly told her . <PARA> on 22 august 2017 , the day after the eclipse , the redding , california television news channel krcr published a report which quoted a local nurse practitioner : <PARA> we attempted to contact patterson on more than one occasion but were unable to track her down , so we were unable to ask her for evidence that might support or corroborate her claim or to speak to the colleague who purportedly told her about the patients . therefore , we cannot say whether anyone in the redding , california area did in fact apply sunscreen to their eyes in advance of the solar eclipse in august 2017 . <PARA> it is certainly possible , but it is also possible that a miscommunication ( including the possibility of a misunderstood joke or undetected irony ) happened at several stages : between patterson and the krcr reporter ; between patterson and her colleague ; and between her colleague and someone else , if the colleague was not present when the patients purportedly presented themselves . <PARA> we contacted an ophthalmologist and three urgent care clinics in redding , california ( other than patterson ’ s own ), and none of them reported seeing any patients with any eye damage related to the solar eclipse . we also tried to find other instances of people putting sunscreen on their eyeballs by selecting 13 cities across the united states where the eclipse coverage was similar to that in redding ( around 86 percent of the sun was covered ), and calling urgent care clinics and ophthalmologists . none reported seeing any patients who had applied sunscreen to their eyes . in fact , only one said they had seen “ a few ” patients with any sort of eye damage from the eclipse . <PARA> interestingly , two ophthalmologists told us they had seen patients who complained of eye damage after the eclipse , but after inspection it turned out none of them actually had any injury . this is obviously a small sample , but it could suggest that the purported incidents in redding , california — if they did take place at all — were extremely rare .

false	in the days following hurricane harvey , which caused catastrophic flooding in southeast texas in late august 2017 , an image began circulating online that appeared to show president donald trump leaning over the side of a raft , reaching out to a stranded flood victim . <PARA> tellingly , the president is pictured wearing a suit and no life vest — an unlikely scenario in a dangerous flood . presidents also generally do not personally take part in rescue operations after disasters . <PARA> the image , unsurprisingly , was digitally altered . the original can be found on cnn ’ s web site and actually depicts three rescuers with the austin fire department reaching out to help a man clinging to a chain link fence out of the water : <PARA> the original incident did not even take place during hurricane harvey in 2017 . instead , the image captures a rescue that occurred in the aftermath of flooding in central texas in 2015 , before donald trump was elected president . <PARA> video of the rescue was captured by austin ’ s kxan news : <PARA> president trump did visit storm - ravaged southeast texas after hurricane harvey on 29 august 2017 , but he did not go out on floodwaters to rescue victims .	
true	on 25 august 2017 , hurricane harvey made landfall in texas , bringing extended heavy rainfall , flooding , and , of course , rumors and scams in its wake . <PARA> one such rumor involved high - paying federal emergency management agency jobs (“ fema field inspectors ”) purportedly created by the storm . readers forwarded various versions of the rumor they spotted on social media , most mentioning a “ mr . adrian davis ” recruiting a thousand workers for positions paying between $ 2 , 000 and $ 5 , 000 per week : <PARA> the rumor spread quickly , thanks to its plausible premise of fema being understaffed in august 2017 , the high ( but not impossibly so ) pay described , and the ease with which one could plausibly qualify . although some iterations listed an area code of ( 888 ) and a contact name of “ adrian davis ,” others provided a 214 ( dallas - area ) number which appears to have no affiliation with fema . a poster provided an application deadline of 31 august 2017 : <PARA> on 30 august 2017 , the agency addressed the “ fema field inspectors ” rumor on its official facebook page : <PARA> according to fema , these jobs are available under a pre - existing contract “ to assist with surge capacity ,” and the 214 number circulating is legitimate , as is the 31 august 2017 deadline . however , fema says the 888 number is not legitimate and the “$ 2 , 000 a week for 90 days ” claim is inaccurate . <PARA> we contacted the agency for further confirmation , but we have not yet received a response .	
unproven	as the 2016 presidential campaign closed in on the finish line , the washington post published an eleven - year - old tape of republican nominee donald trump ’ s making controversial remarks about women . the inevitable partisan rancor that ensued largely targeted the behavior bill clinton , husband of democratic candidate hillary clinton , including the repetition of rumors that he had been expelled from oxford university in 1969 for raping classmate eileen wellstone . <PARA> the allegations weren ’ t new — republican opposition research strategist roger stone had tweeted about them a year earlier : <PARA> the backdrop for these rumors was that just prior to his graduation from georgetown university , bill clinton won a prestigious rhodes scholarship to study at university college , oxford , for two years and headed off to england for the 1968 - 69 academic term — but he returned to the united states before finishing out the full two - year course of study . <PARA> in october 1992 , during bill clinton ’ s first presidential campaign , a british news report included interviews with a number of clinton ’ s oxford classmates . the article described clinton ’ s truncated study trajectory at oxford as one that was disrupted by the vietnam - era draft , not by penalties for misbehavior . had clinton left oxford under dubious circumstances , reporting on such a scoop just prior to the presidential election of 1992 would have been irresistible for the british ( and american ) press . but clinton ’ s classmates made absolutely no mention of his departing abruptly or in disgrace : <PARA> clinton ’ s non - completion of the scholar program at oxford was public knowledge more than 20 years prior to the origination of rumors that he had been expelled from that university for sexual misconduct . and as documented in a separate article on this site , clinton ’ s efforts to avoid the military draft ( ostensibly by joining the rotc at the university of arkansas ) were the likely reason behind the timing of his movements between the u . s . and england . <PARA> nonetheless , by june 2004 the eileen wellstone rape allegation had appeared in the washington times , published in an article that lacked an author , a citation , or any other information supporting the claim : <PARA> although often unattributed , the claim appears to have originated with a february 1999 article on capitol hill blue ( a web site known for publishing dubious information at that time ). that primary iteration ( since deleted ) mentioned nothing about clinton ’ s having been expelled from oxford , but it alleged — based on a second - hand report from an anonymous source — that wellstone had accused clinton of sexually assaulting her during his time at oxford : <PARA> this account doesn ’ t jibe with the timeline established in our own research and stated elsewhere , which has clinton in the united states ( not on a “ european tour ”) during the summer of 1969 , and then returning to england for his second year at oxford ( rather than being told “ he was no longer welcome there ”) where he remained at least as late as january 1970 : <PARA> roger stone was a primary catalyst of the rumor ’ s spread . but while he maintained in 2014 that clinton was expelled from oxford over a sexual assault incident , he said in 2015 that little to no action was taken . his later reference didn ’ t involve clinton ’ s expulsion and hinged on what stone “ believed ” may have taken place : <PARA> stone also made two mentions of wellstone in his 2015 book the clintons ’ war on women , co - authored by robert morrow , who was the subject of a 2008 tampa bay times profile which didn ’ t imply an overabundance of credibility or tendency toward critical examination of clinton conspiracies : <PARA> stone and morrow ’ s book contained two passages about wellstone which appeared be be based on second - or third - hand information . moreover , those passages contained contradictory information : in one , the authors said clinton ’ s expulsion or coerced departure from oxford “ could not be confirmed ”; in another , the authors plainly asserted without qualification that clinton had been expelled . and all of the cited information traced back to the single questionable 1999 capitol hill blue report : <PARA> the original capitol hill blue piece included several instances that all followed the same pattern : a young woman whom no one had ever heard of ( in most cases the women weren ’ t even identified by name ) had supposedly accused bill clinton of sexual assault decades earlier but had declined to pursue any charges against him at the time . capitol hill blue somehow managed to track all these women down , and all of them allegedly “ confirmed ” their experiences — yet none of them was directly quoted , and all of them declined to go on record or discuss the matter any further . moreover all of these incidents were coincidentally also “ confirmed ” by other people ( e . g ., government officials , retired policemen , former students ), none of whom was identified by name or directly quoted either . <PARA> even more curiously , as far as we know no one else has ever located , talked to , or interviewed eileen wellstone or any of the other women referenced in capitol hill blue who were supposedly the victim of sexual assaults by bill clinton between 1969 and 1974 . nor has anyone else ever identified , located , talked to , or interviewed the anonymous state department official and others who purportedly “ confirmed ” these rumors . <PARA> all in all , the rumors about bill clinton ’ s having been expelled from oxford over a rape allegation appear to have stemmed from a single uncorroborated , anonymous second - hand report published on a web site of dubious repute in 1999 , combined with mere speculation about clinton ’ s having departed oxford prior to the completion of a full two - year course of study . we haven ’ t yet turned up anything that would counter the notion that the “ eileen wellstone ” claim was simply a fabrication made up in 1999 .	
false	in august 2017 , a national debate about the display of confederate flags and monuments once again gained steam after a protest of the planned removal of a statue of confederate general robert e . lee from a park in charlottesville , virginia turned deadly . <PARA> in the wake of that incident , several cities ( and protestors ) moved to quickly take down monuments , statues , and plaques . meanwhile , rumors appeared that congress had passed two laws retroactively declaring confederate soldiers united states veterans , which means that removing the statues is illegal . some of the claims were bolstered by a link to an extremely dubious web site : <PARA> the rumor also appeared as a meme on the facebook page “ uncle sam ’ s misguided children ” on 16 august 2017 : <PARA> the same image was previously shared by the same facebook page in a july 2015 , just after a gunman in charleston , south carolina , killed nine black churchgoers . according to the meme , two acts of congress ( public law 810 of 1929 and public law 85 - 425 of 1958 ) bestows upon confederate soldiers the benefits and status of a united states military veteran . <PARA> public law 810 refers to part ii , chapter 23 of u . s . code 38 which says that the government should , when requested , pay to put up monuments or headstones for unmarked graves for three groups of people : <PARA> no portion of the law appears to confer any privilege other than markers for graves of confederate soldiers , nor does it grant confederate soldiers status equal to those of veterans of the united states military . as of 1901 , 482 individuals ( not all soldiers ) were already interred in the confederate section of arlington national cemetery . <PARA> in 1868 , president andrew johnson pardoned confederate soldiers , but did not grant them u . s . veteran status . public law 85 - 425 was passed 23 may 1958 , entitling the widows of deceased confederate soldiers ( what few were left by 1958 ) to military pensions : <PARA> a national archives and records administration document details the matter of confederate soldiers and pensions , and shows that the law seems to recognize those who fought for the confederacy as veterans of a war , but not necessarily of the united states military . <PARA> the last recorded confederate soldier deaths were in 1959 , meaning that the 1957 law had negligible effects for those under its provisions , and in any event the law again conferred no status or other benefit to confederate soldiers themselves . <PARA> we reached out to several historians , none of whom wished to be quoted on the record . several were dubious about the purported laws . one , a scholar who specializes in the civil war and reconstruction , told us that he , too , had trouble locating them : <PARA> the cited ruling did not recognize the flag of the confederacy as a legitimate american flag suitable for display in veterans ’ memorials . the veterans ’ affairs document to which the historian pointed , federal stewardship of confederate dead , contained historical context about confederate burials and the evolution of federal involvement in the interment of their dead , and included president william mckinley ’ s 1898 remarks to legislators in georgia , noting that was a time when “ no disabled confederate veteran was eligible to live in a federal soldier ’ s home , receive a pension , or , when they died , be buried in a national cemetery ”: <PARA> until the turn of the 20th century , united states government interment of confederate soldiers generally involved deceased prisoners buried during the civil war on union lands . in 2013 , the atlantic reported that the united states government continued to follow through on its subsequent promises to provide for all confederate war dead : <PARA> when a debate over confederate monuments and flags came under the national spotlight in june 2015 , codified changes in burials and pensions enacted in 1929 and 1958 were puffed up to suggest that a nebulous act of congress , either in the 1920s or the 1950s , officially declared that confederate soldiers were the same as united states veterans in the eyes of the federal government . however , no legislation either explicitly or implicitly granted confederate soldiers status as united states veterans . survivors of dead confederate soldiers often took offense at measures appearing to equate them to union soldiers , objections that died off as southerners from the civil war era did .	
false	in mid - august 2017 , the disreputable web site freedomdaily . com posted a story with the clickbait headline “ packers coach just pissed off every racist player with what he put on field to stop protests .” <PARA> the story is essentially an invective against football players that have been kneeling during the playing of the national anthem before games as an act of protest against racism . the practice started with then - san francisco 49ers quarterback colin kaepernick , who kneeled to protest police shootings of african - americans . on 21 august 2017 , 12 cleveland browns players escalated the protest in response to violence at a white supremacist rally in charlottesville , virgnia , that left a woman dead and 19 injured . <PARA> it takes a few minutes of reading before one discovers the headline is misleading — mccarthy didn ’ t put anything on the field . instead , he ’ s having players watch an educational presentation about the historical significance of playing the anthem before games . freedomdaily . com quotes the wisconsin state journal , which reported : <PARA> the quote was taken from a press conference , where mccarthy and packers general manager thompson were asked about the issue . thompson responded by saying that it ’ s a “ free country ” and the players are free to protest how they see fit . <PARA> mccarthy also said that he has given the presentation “ each and every year ” since he became head coach — in other words , since 2006 , long before the controversy began over players kneeling during the anthem . <PARA> freedomdaily . com posted a similarly - formatted story about the cowboys — reporting dallas coach jason garrett was putting some vague item on the football field to anger “ racist ” players . garrett said he felt the flag and anthem were sacred but he , like mccarthy , isn ’ t putting anything on the field . further the freedomdaily story flips the narrative by calling the protesting players racists — all of them have been people of color up until 21 august 2017 when a white player joined his teammates in kneeling to protest against racism .	
false	a series of images showing a manual purportedly written by “ antifa ,” or anti - fascist protestors , was published on various internet forums and websites in august 2017 . the first page of the alleged “ antifa manual ” can be seen below , while the remaining 7 pages have been archived here : <PARA> “ the antifa manual ” gained traction on social media around the same time a purported flyer from the anti - fascist group which called for the murder of white children was being circulated . as both of these fraudulent documents shared many of the same telling characteristics , here is a rundown of ways to tell that the manual is fake : <PARA> although we ’ ve only come across one set of images purportedly showing this “ antifa manual ,” we ’ ve seen several different claims about where and how this document was found . although most asserted that this document was found at evergreen state college , others claimed that it was found at the white nationalist rally in charlottesville . others declared that the manual had been “ leaked .” <PARA> the earliest posting of this document that we could uncover was shared on the web site imgur on 12 august 2017 by a user named “ jebediah88 .” as the anti - defamation league explains on their web site , “ 88 is a white supremacist numerical code for “ heil hitler .” <PARA> as with the fake antifa flyer , these images purport to show a document that was created by a central or national antifa group and distributed to members in order to inform them about various policies , philosophies , or organizational rules . but there is no overarching antifa organization or leadership . instead , there are a variety of antifa groups who are loosely organized , as historian mark bray wrote in the washington post : <PARA> the actual text of “ the antifa manual ” contains several passages that contradict what we know about antifa groups . the cover page , for instance , states that this document should not be given to “ cis white males , non - poc , non - lgbtq peoples .” yet , cis white males ( white men whose gender identity matches the gender they were assigned at birth ), non - poc ( white people ) and non - lgbtq ( those who do not identify as lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender , or queer ) individuals are welcome members of antifa groups . <PARA> other passages read more like satire . for example , one paragraph describes “ antifa regulators ” who will monitor the use of racial epithets . other passages spout conspiracy theories , such as microchipping all individuals or building a “ new world order .” none of these ideas align with any messages that are actually espoused by antifa groups . <PARA> other portions mocked the group ’ s members (“ those who can ’ t work will be provided a stipend and unlimited supply of opiates , marijuana , meth and cocaine to occupy their free time ”), insultingly described groups of people that antifa supposedly champion (“ container ship after container ship will be converted to massive passenger cruise - liners and will ferry poverty - stricken brown people from around the world to the ( former ) united states and western europe ”), or were racially insensitive or demeaning . <PARA> here are some of the more unbelievable passages : <PARA> the nyc antifa group told us in an email that this “ antifa manual ” was fake . they also directed us to some general literature published by antifa - supporting outlets , such as the anarchist news web site it ’ s going down , for comparison . it ’ s going down published it ’ s own manual called “ forming an antifa group : a manual ,” which is starkly different from the fake antifa manual addressed above . <PARA> for instance , the fake antifa manual labeled cisgender white men as the “ greatest evil mankind has ever known .” the “ forming an antifa group ” manual , on the other hand , focuses on tracking and opposing white supremacist groups . <PARA> the fake antifa manual also outlines various political standpoints of the group . however , the genuine article noted that while antifa groups are aligned in their opposition to fascism , they do not necessarily agree on other political issues :	
true	on 15 august 2017 , the conservative gateway pundit web site reported that a group of protesters outside the hennepin county jail in minneapolis , minnesota , had removed the county ’ s flag and erected one of their own – bearing the insignia of the anti - fascist “ antifa ” movement . <PARA> two days later , the right - wing cns news web site further reported that the same protesters had burned the hennepin county flag which they removed from a flag - pole outside the building . <PARA> these posts use hyperbolic language and slightly exaggerate events — for example , the protestors did not “ storm ” the building , but rather protested outside it . <PARA> there was an anti - racist protest in minneapolis on 14 august 2017 , which was organized to show solidarity with the counter - protestors at a white supremacist rally in charlottesvile , virginia two days earlier . protestors did indeed remove a county flag and replace it with an antifa flag . <PARA> according to the minneapolis - based star tribune , the demonstration involved : “ the anti - war committee , students for a democratic society , new north , the minnesota immigrant rights action committee and other groups .” <PARA> video posted to twitter by leah soule clearly shows some of the protesters erecting the antifa flag outside the hennepin county public safety facility ( which includes the county jail ). <PARA> in a statement , a spokesperson for hennepin county confirmed the accuracy of these claims , but noted that the incident lasted for less than half an hour : <PARA> the spokesperson further clarified that it was , indeed , protesters who destroyed the hennepin county flag . <PARA> according to the minneapolis police department , no arrests were made at the protest , and there is no ongoing investigation .	
false	on 8 august 2017 , right wing news site breitbart . com published a story suggesting that residents of the city of el cajon , california were in danger of contracting tuberculosis , based on a study of refugees to the u . s . published in 2013 : <PARA> from there it pivoted to the findings of a team led by timothy rodwell , an associate professor at the university of california , san diego ’ s school of medicine . rodwell and his fellow researchers examined the results of latent tuberculosis infection ( ltbi ) tests for refugees who moved to san diego county between january 2010 and october 2012 , the majority of whom came from the middle east . <PARA> according to the study , 823 of the refugees tested positive for ltbi , while another 14 “ had an abnormal result ” on radiographs that was consistent with active tuberculosis . breitbart then surmised : <PARA> that figure was based in part on the centers for disease control ’ s findings of 2 . 9 cases per 100 , 000 for 2016 in the u . s . <PARA> rodwell — who noted that no one from breitbart . com contacted him prior to publishing its story — told us : <PARA> rodwell said that the site apparently took 14 ( the number of cases “ consistent with active tb ”) and divided it by 4 , 280 ( the total number of refugees involved in the study ). that comes out to around 0 . 0032710 . they then multiplied . 0032710 by 100 , 000 ( the standard measure for reporting incidence of disease in populations ), giving them an “ incidence ” of 327 . 102 , or 327 per 100 , 000 : <PARA> he also took issue with the site ’ s extrapolation from his team ’ s data : <PARA> he also pointed out that testing positive for ltbi and having active tuberculosis are “ extremely different ”: <PARA> breitbart also neglected to mention that 489 ( 59 percent ) of the refugees who tested positive for lbti were offered treatment . the report by rodwell ’ s team stated that another 334 refugees diagnosed with the infection did not receive similar offers , mostly because they were fifty years old or older , in which case they were referred to local medical providers . <PARA> according to the study , 373 refugees accepted the offer of treatment , with 219 of them ( 58 . 7 percent ) completing it by the time it was published . another 78 were still being treated at the time of publication , while 39 “ defaulted ” from treatment . <PARA> a spokesperson for san diego county , craig sturak , told us that between 2012 and 2016 , resettled refugees accounted 4 percent of the county ’ s active tuberculosis cases . overall , the county reported a tb incidence rate of 8 . 0 per 100 , 000 residents in 2016 , down . 4 percent compared to 2011 . <PARA> while both the study and the starbucks event were legitimate , their connection stopped there . one had absolutely nothing to do with the other except in the context of the commitment by the coffee company to hire more refugees and the hiring drive itself .	
true	in the aftermath of violence at a white supremacist rally in charlottesville , virginia in august 2017 ( and in the context of a wider debate over the removal of confederate statues ), a particular quote spread on facebook and twitter , appearing to indicate abraham lincoln ’ s opposition to racial equality . on 14 august , the remarks formed part of a dallas morning news column by former texas state senator jerry patterson , who wrote : <PARA> the quote as presented by patterson , and in several facebook and twitter posts , is authentic . lincoln did make those remarks on 18 september 1858 . they came at the beginning of his opening speech at the fourth of seven famous debates with stephen douglas , during lincoln ’ s unsuccessful campaign for the u . s . senate in illinois . lincoln had been under attack from democrats who accused him of supporting racial equality , and his comments were a defense against those allegations . <PARA> there is no official transcript of those debates , and the accounts published at the time in two illinois newspapers — the republican chicago press and tribune and the democratic chicago times — often diverged along partisan lines , according to rodney davis and douglas wilson ’ s annotated “ lincoln - douglas debates ” ( page vii .) <PARA> nonetheless , here are the most relevant remarks , as reported in the pro - lincoln chicago press and tribune on 21 september 1858 . you can read that day ’ s report in full here . <PARA> despite the frequent spinning of the speeches by both newspapers , there appears to be consensus on lincoln ’ s charleston remarks regarding racial equality . the chicago times report , reprinted in harold holzer ’ s 1993 lincoln - douglas debates , does not significantly vary from that published by the press and tribune : <PARA> of course , this excerpt from one speech does not represent the totality of lincoln ’ s views on race and racial equality , but the remarks were far from a complete outlier , and lincoln ’ s views were more complex and uncomfortable than the prevalent modern impression of him as the racially - enlightened great emancipator . <PARA> we spoke to columbia university historian eric foner , author of several books on lincoln , including the fiery trial : abraham lincoln and american slavery . <PARA> “ there ’ s no question that : one , before the civil war , lincoln hated slavery . he always did ,” foner told us : <PARA> during the civil war , foner says , lincoln ’ s views evolved radically as he was exposed to black people such as frederick douglass , who were far more talented than he had assumed , and as the efforts of freed slaves in the union army earned them , in lincoln ’ s view , the right to citizenship . <PARA> just before his death , lincoln gave a speech in which he mentioned the possibility of giving black union soldiers and wealthy black elites the right to vote , in direct contradiction to his 1858 remarks . and yet , foner told us , for a long time lincoln ’ s plan for black people in the united states largely consisted of arranging for them to the leave the country and set up colonies elsewhere . <PARA> foner also warned against overemphasizing the importance of ethnicity to lincoln by isolating specific racist remarks he made : <PARA> “ whereas abolition was a central aspect of lincoln ’ s moral compass ”, the harvard historian henry louis gates wrote in 2009 , “ racial equality was not ”: <PARA> gates concluded :

true	on 31 july 2017 , reports appeared that a 30 - year - old man had died from a fat embolism after undergoing penis enhancement surgery in sweden : <PARA> it is an extraordinary story , which prompted us to double - check its veracity . ( buzzfeed had published a version of the story two days earlier with a headline reading “ a penis enlargement killed a man in sweden .”) <PARA> both articles accurately recount the facts of what is a real case that was indeed published on 27 july 2017 in a case report in the journal of forensic sciences , an academic journal published by the american academy of forensic sciences . it describes a 30 - year - old man in stockholm , sweden , with no past medical history — apart from mild asthma — undergoing penis enhancement surgery , which the authors say is “ generally considered a safe procedure .” <PARA> the procedure involved fat being suctioned from his abdomen and injected into his penis , but towards the end of the surgery , the man ’ s heart rate increased abnormally , and surgeons observed low blood pressure and low oxygen levels in the blood . half an hour later , the man went into cardiac arrest , and 78 minutes after that , he was pronounced dead . at autopsy , the cause of death was found to be pulmonary fat embolism , meaning fat had entered the blood stream and reached the lungs , causing a fatal blockage there . <PARA> the case report points out that this is the first reported case of penile enhancement surgery causing a fatal fat embolism , but that this outcome had previously been observed in a small number of surgeries where fat was injected into a person ’ s face or buttocks . fat embolism is a “ rare , but feared complication ” of liposuction , the authors write , and is more common after a traumatic event such as a long bone fracture ( like the femur and tibia ) or orthopaedic surgery ( like spinal surgery or hip replacement ). <PARA> based on this case report , zilg and rasten - almqvist theorize that the risk of a fat embolism might be elevated when fat is injected into pretraumatized tissue ( as in this case , where a penis elongation was performed before the fat injection ).	
false	rats ( at least the kinds commonly kept as pets ) are for the most part intelligent , clean , quiet , sociable , and even affectionate . still , there are many people who are absolutely repulsed at the sight of any rat and will run screaming even from the tamest rattus norvegicus . this reaction is due in large part to our culture ’ s association of rats with filth , poverty , disease , and death . rats are the furtive invaders who hide in the dark , dank spaces of our buildings and towns , emerging en masse after dark to feed on garbage and food scraps . they can carry disease , either directly or via the insects that feed on them ( such as the fleas whose bite spread the bubonic plague ). although in the wild they ’ re shy and prefer to avoid contact with humans , they have long , narrow teeth housed in strong jaws that can deliver powerful defensive bites when necessary . <PARA> rats tend to live where humans live , since the presence of man generally creates an abundance of food and shelter . because rats live for the most part out of the sight of people and usually emerge from their dwelling places when we ’ re either asleep or not around to see them , it ’ s easy to imagine that far more of them are lurking in those impenetrable dark spaces than really are there . we create maxims that are far more reflections of our anxieties and fears about feeling surrounded by unseen crawly things than they are accurate estimators of populations — sayings such as “ you ’ re never more than six feet away from a rat ” and “ for every cockroach you see , there are ten more you don ’ t see .” <PARA> another statistic in this vein is the “ one rat per person ” rule — the claim that in any sufficiently large urban area , the rat population is as large as the human population : <PARA> this statistic reflects the frightening belief that no matter how much we may try to trap , poison , or otherwise chase away those fearsome rodents , we cannot vanquish them ; they will always be able to field an army of insurgents equal in number to our own . but , according to robert sullivan , the author of rats , this statistic is based upon a nearly century - old misunderstanding and greatly exaggerates the true number of rats to be found in a typical city . <PARA> the “ one rat per person ” claim stems from a study of rats conducted in england by w . r . boelter and published in 1909 under the title the rat problem . boelter surveyed the english countryside ( but not villages , towns , or cities ) and came up with an educated guess , estimating that england had one rat per acre of cultivated land . since england had 40 million acres of cultivated land at the time , boelter pegged the country ’ s rat population at 40 million . and since england also had a human population of 40 million at the time , there was some basis for claiming that the country was host to one rat per person . <PARA> but boelter ’ s estimate may have been way off the mark , and even if it was accurate , the putative 1 : 1 ratio between people and rats derived from it was merely coincidental , an artifact of england ’ s just happening to have a human population equal to its number of cultivated acres . “ one rat per person ” was a figure unique to the time and place in which boelter conducted his study , not a generalized figure that could be applied everywhere . nonetheless , as sullivan noted , “ people loved that statistic , maybe because they abhorred it ,” and the figure is still frequently cited in news articles dealing with rat control efforts in large metropolitan areas , particularly new york city : <PARA> even figures several orders of magnitude higher than “ one per person ” are sometimes quoted in reference to new york ’ s rat population : <PARA> just how many rats are to be found in a large city like new york ? far fewer than one might think :

false	on 16 july 2017 , alternative health blogger erin elizabeth reported on her web site health nut news that justine ruszczyk ( who primarily used her fiance ’ s surname , damond ), a 40 - year - old australian woman living in the u . s . who was shot and killed in mid - july 2017 by minneapolis police , was among a growing list of holistic doctors who had died under suspicious circumstances . that narrative was further twisted by the disreputable conspiracy site yournewswire with the headline , “ holistic doctor , working against big pharma , shot dead by police .” <PARA> elizabeth compiled a list in 2016 of what she characterized as more than sixty holistic doctors that died between june 2015 and august 2016 , asserting that the deaths were somehow connected . although elizabeth stopped short of saying who the culprit was , the implication was that the healers were being systematically killed because of their occupations . <PARA> as we noted in may 2017 , the tragedies are unrelated to each other — there is no evidence of a conspiracy to wipe out holistic doctors . elizabeth ’ s list was a sloppy compilation of natural deaths , accidents and crimes . ten of the people on the list , in fact , had no connection to holistic medicine . that didn ’ t stop yournewswire ( and others ) from turning the damond shooting into yet another tragedy blatantly exploited by conspiracy theorists : <PARA> there are subgroups of americans who are disproportionately killed by police , but holistic healers as a group are not among them . african - american people and mentally ill people , for example , have higher likelihoods of being victims in such incidents . to say that damond ’ s death is the result of her occupation as a holistic healer is to disingenuously supplant a factual social problem with a fictional one . the sydney , australian native ’ s 15 july 2017 death could be linked instead to an actual pattern in the united states in which civilians are extrajudicially killed while interacting with police officers . <PARA> as of 24 july , 688 people have been killed by american law enforcement in 2017 , according to the tracking site killedbypolice . net . the web site tallied 1 , 162 law enforcement - related deaths in 2016 . ( because the federal government has fallen short in tracking such killings , volunteers have stepped up to the plate with databases like killed by police and fatal encounters .) <PARA> according to the hennepin county medical examiner ’ s office , damond did die from a gunshot wound to the abdomen , and her death was ruled a homicide . but contradicting the suspicion that damond was the target of an assassination due to her alternative health practices , she herself dialed 911 at 11 : 30 p . m ., because she heard what she believed to be a sexual assault outside her minneapolis , minnesota home — and her call for emergency services ended with her death . <PARA> according to the minneapolis bureau of criminal apprehension , which is investigating the incident , two minneapolis police department officers , matthew harrity and mohamed noor , responded to the call . harrity was driving and noor was in the passenger seat . according to the bca ’ s preliminary investigation , harrity said he was startled by a loud noise just as damond approached the squad car . noor opened fire through harrity ’ s open driver ’ s side window , striking damond in the abdomen . <PARA> further contradicting the notion that damond ’ s death was an assassination , both officers tried to revive her . they “ immediately exited the squad and provided medical attention until medical personnel arrived ,” according to the bca . <PARA> the case is part of an ongoing — and wrenching — public discourse over police killings . neither harrity or noor ’ s body cameras filmed the shooting , nor did the squad car ’ s camera . police killings of people like philando castile , eric garner , mike brown , manuel diaz , and kelly thomas have resulted in civil unrest in recent years . <PARA> almost exactly one year before damond ’ s death , st . anthony , minnesota police officer jeromino yanez killed philando castile during a traffic stop . castile was a licensed gun owner who had told yanez he had his permitted weapon with him in the car ; he was shot while trying to comply with the officer ’ s orders . the grim aftermath of the shooting was broadcast live on social media by his girlfriend , diamond reynolds , who was in the car with him along with her 4 - year - old daughter . yanez was charged with manslaughter , but was acquitted in june 2017 . <PARA> although questions have been raised in news reports about noor ’ s and yanez ’ s training in relations to the deaths of the two minnesota residents , there is no evidence to suggest that “ big pharma ” somehow influenced the two officers who responded to damond ’ s 911 call to target her for assassination in an ongoing conspiracy to kill off holistic healers .

false	as temperatures approached triple digits in london in june 2017 , an image of a sign reminding passengers to drink water and wear deodorant purportedly posted in the london underground metro system by transportation authorities appeared on social media : <PARA> this sign , of course , was not actually posted by transport for london , the city agency in charge of public transportation . <PARA> although we have not pinpointed the exact origins of this image ( the earliest iteration we found was posted on 19 june 2017 with the message “ please read if u get on the trains / tubes in london during the summer ??”), we did find several examples of genuine signs posted by transport for london informing passengers to stay hydrated : <PARA> we ’ ve reached out to transport for london , who confirmed that the sign saying the tube smelled like a 16 - year - old ham was fake .	
false	whether the accounts reproduced above really represent an “ actual true story and not one of those internet stories that are passed on and on ” is unknown , but the main point that most readers have taken from them is undeniably not true : calling # 77 or 112 from your cell phone will not connect you to emergency services no matter where you are , nor doing so connect you with emergency services even when your cell phone does not have an adequate signal to place outgoing calls . <PARA> although in a few states in the u . s . calling # 77 on a cell phone will immediately connect you to that state ’ s highway patrol , that code is far from universal . some states use # 77 , but others use * 55 , * 47 , * 77 or * hp , and some don ’ t have any special code at all . rather than frantically try to figure out which one will work in the area you ’ re in , police generally recommend that the best approach is to get around the problem by trying 911 first : <PARA> the phone number 112 is used as a global emergency phone number in a number of countries , primarily in the european union . in some parts of the united states a call to 112 will roll over to the local 911 system , but since 112 is not implemented as a universal emergency number in the u . s ., calling 911 directly is the better option . <PARA> some police agencies have even issued social media warnings advising the public not to call 112 at all , saying that “ the ( idea ) that calling 1 - 1 - 2 is somehow faster than calling 9 - 1 - 1 is utterly false .” <PARA> regarding the scenario described in the examples at the head of this page , police advise motorists to immediately pull over when signaled to do so , suggesting those concerned about their safety keep their doors locked and crack their windows to speak with persons presenting themselves as officers of the law . they suggest sidelined drivers who are suspicious of their detainers ’ demands should request to examine the officers ’ photo ids and ask them where they work , then place calls to 911 to verify their identities . while this would certainly be the right way to handle genuine police officers making bona fide traffic stops , this method may fail to protect motorists from the ill - intentioned . real bad guys often carry guns , against which locked car doors and cracked windows would avail little by way of protection . <PARA> the instance of rapists and murderers pretending to be police officers is not of epidemic proportions , but enough incidents of this nature have occurred that precautions are warranted . in 1948 in los angeles , caryl chessman successfully robbed couples and sexually assaulted a number of women in california after first fooling them into believing he was a police officer by flashing a red light at their vehicles . ( though often he approached parked cars this way , in at least one case he managed to pull over a car that was driving on pacific coast highway .) his method of approach earned him the nickname of “ the red light bandit .” chessman was executed on a kidnapping charge in 1960 , but only after gaining fame for writing three books while in prison ( most notably cell 2455 death row ) and becoming the focus of the then nascent movement to abolish the death penalty . <PARA> since then others have used similar ruses to isolate their victims . more recently , in 1997 arkansas was plagued by its “ blue light rapist ” who assaulted three women after first luring them to the side of the road with the help of a police - style blue light mounted on his car . robert todd burmingham was sentenced in 1998 to 80 years in prison for rape , kidnapping , and aggravated robbery . <PARA> in 2000 , a tampa woman was sexually assaulted by a man who had put a flashing blue and red light atop his car and motioned her off the road as if he was a police officer . after she admitted she had been drinking , he offered to drive her home ; she got into his car , and he took her to an isolated location where he raped her . that case is still open . <PARA> someone who has taken to impersonating a police officer for nefarious purposes is counting upon his intended victim ’ s unquestioning cooperation . because he appears in the guise of a trusted authority figure whose commands must be obeyed , he expects automatic reaction to kick in even if it overrides common sense . that could prove a fatal error to make . <PARA> in 1996 governor pataki of new york issued an executive order to prevent unmarked state police cars from stopping motorists for routine traffic violations , citing “ a growing number of cases around the country in which criminals trap their victims by posing as police officers .” <PARA> a march 2002 version of the story changed the girl ’ s name from lauren to lisa . an october 2003 version moved the action to australia . once again , 19 - year - old lauren barely escaped disaster , but she did so by using the “ no . 112 feature ” on her cell phone to summon help . a july 2004 version shifted the story to canada , but in this instance lauren dialed * 677 . ( the number * 677 , aka * opp , is the non - emergency cell phone caller line of the ontario provincial police .)

true	over the years we ’ ve received numerous inquiries about how much it costs to mint a u . s . penny , usually phrased as “ i heard it costs 8 ¢ ( or 10 ¢ or 12 ¢) to make a penny — is that true ? it does indeed cost more than one cent to manufacture a one - cent piece , although not quite the multi - cented disparity rumor would have it . or , at least not yet . <PARA> ( the proper name for what we all call the penny is a “ cent ,” but we ’ ll adhere to popular usage in this article rather than be pedants about it .) <PARA> each year the u . s . mint puts millions of new pennies into circulation ( 4 . 9 billion in 2011 , for instance ), and the cost of producing each of those pennies involves four components : metal , fabrication ( pre - production metal processing ), labor / overhead and transportation . metal is largest component of this cost : the penny has been composed of 97 . 5 % zinc and 2 . 5 % copper since 1982 , and because the price of those metals fluctuates , so too does the cost of producing pennies . <PARA> in 2005 , the cost to the united states mint to produce a penny was 0 . 97 ¢, which was just a smidge under a cent . in 2006 , that year ’ s pennies each cost about 1 . 23 ¢ to manufacture . rises in metal prices , particularly of zinc , pushed the per - unit cost up to 1 . 7 ¢ in 2007 . by 2012 , production costs had risen to 2 . 41 ¢ per penny . <PARA> the current price discrepancy between the value of the metals in the coins and the value of the coins themselves has sparked a growing cottage industry of melting down cents to harvest for resale the copper and zinc they contain . the u . s . government has countered both by restricting the export of pennies and by making it illegal to melt them down . coin melters could spend up to five years in prison for their pains . <PARA> various ideas have been kited as to how to address the problem of rising production costs . some folks have long held that single cents should be dropped from the roster of american coinage , with prices thereafter rounded up or down to the nearest nickel . some have advocated minting pennies ( nickels too , which also cost more to manufacture than their face value ) from cheaper metals . and some have counseled holding course while waiting for metal prices to decline . <PARA> were it not for the matter of the metal they contain being worth significantly more than the face value of coins ( in these last few years ), all the furor and “ say it ’ s not so !” attaching to pennies ’ costing more to make than they can buy for you at the grocery store would be mere academic quibbling : a penny that cost over 2 ¢ to make isn ’ t all that big of a deal once the concept of multiple use is grasped . <PARA> if pennies were used but once then thrown away , yes , of course their costing american taxpayers 2 . 41 ¢ apiece would be a horrible , horrible thing . but they ’ re not : pennies pass through hundreds , thousands , and maybe even millions of hands before they somehow drop out of circulation , which more than covers the additional 1 . 41 ¢ that went into their manufacture . in other words , while it ’ s a great “ gosh , golly , gee ” fact to fling at your friends (“ say , joe , did you know it costs 2 . 41 ¢ to manufacture a coin that ’ s worth only 1 ¢?”), all the gobsmackedness of it runs right out of that conversation stopper once you pause to ponder how many times that one penny will change hands .

false	on 1 october 2015 , ten people ( nine innocent victims plus the gunman ) died in a mass shooting at umpqua community college in roseburg , oregon . the incident marked the 294th mass shooting in 2015 alone and prompted yet another renewal of a national gun control debate in the u . s . <PARA> folks on both sides of that political debate would likely agree that the sandy hook shooting in 2012 was a pivotal point in a perpetual american gun control controversy . perhaps due to the unique horrors of that event , an unusually high number of conspiracy theories grew out of it : some gun control advocates on social media later described the tragedy as proof positive americans weren ’ t interested in changing gun laws despite the exceptional pain inflicted by the incident , while some gun rights advocates asserted the events in newtown were a government - sponsored false flag engineered to artificially justify a “ gun grab .” <PARA> the latter camp wasn ’ t much of a fringe movement — a key law enforcement figure of the roseburg shooting , sheriff john hanlin , had shared sandy hook conspiracy material on his own facebook wall prior to the umpqua community college shooting . the sandy hook shooting was somewhat of a watershed moment for second amendment “ truthers ,” and the conspiracies that sprang forth from it began coloring subsequent ( and in some instances , prior ) high - profile shootings or attacks on civilians in america . <PARA> one of the common conspiracy themes that gained traction after the newtown shooting involved “ crisis actors ,” individuals who had ( to that point ) been primarily known to populate disaster drills . as the notion of gun grabbing conspiracies became more commonplace , the term was appropriated by folks who believed the faces of those grieving at ( staged ) shooting scenes or subsequent vigils were in fact paid government operatives assigned to fabricate the appearance of mourning . a common iteration of the rumor involved photographs taken at crime scenes or vigils in newtown ( connecticut ), aurora ( colorado ), boston : <PARA> after the 1 october 2015 shooting in roseburg , the meme was altered to include what was purportedly yet another appearance by the “ same girl ” seen previously crying in photos from aurora , boston , and sandy hook . ( presumably , the high - level false flag planners didn ’ t have access to social media and remained unaware their schemes had been unraveled and revealed months earlier ): <PARA> the same technology that enabled people to compile and spread the photo set shown above also allowed anyone interested in the rumor to quite quickly determine whether the “ same girl ” was indeed depicted in all four images included in the meme . <PARA> the claim was bizarre partly because the individuals involved were not nameless , faceless mourners of whom no trace was found shortly after the respective tragedies . the largest of the images was also the most iconic and heartbreaking : the photograph ( taken at sandy hook elementary ) that captured the moment during which carlee soto learned her sister victoria soto was among those killed . the image was not the only one available of carlee soto crying , but similar , easily discovered images didn ’ t fit the meme : <PARA> to the right of soto in the photo collection ( which in several iterations is inaccurately labeled as being from “ boston ”) is amanda medek . medek ’ s sister micayla medek was among the dead in the 20 july 2012 aurora , colorado , theater shooting , and the image of medek sitting on steps was one of several captured of her that day : <PARA> photographs taken during happier times definitively show that medek ( at the far right ) and soto look nothing alike ( save for the moments during which each respectively learned their sisters had been murdered ): <PARA> pictured to the left of soto is emma mcdonald , who ( unlike soto and medek ) appeared to be connected to the victims of the boston marathon bombings solely by her presence at a vigil for the victims . as such , mcdonald ’ s link to that tragedy was more fleeting ( and photographs of her were harder to come by ). <PARA> the young woman shown at the bottom ( after the roseburg shooting ) was identified as jessica vazquez , seen crying and hugging aunt leticia alcaraz . ( alcaraz ’ s daughter lucero alcaraz was among the dead at umpqua community college ): <PARA> following a mass shooting in san bernardino on 2 december 2015 an iteration of the rumor held the “ same girl ” was again spotted amid news coverage of the event , albeit this time in a larger crowd shot : <PARA> while all the young women seen in the photographs had long , brown hair ( initially ), that factor alone didn ’ t make a strong case for a massive government conspiracy encompassing law enforcement agencies at several levels in multiple states ( and eventually , multiple countries ). in may 2017 , the conspiracy theory popped up again after 22 people were killed in a bombing at an ariana grande concert in manchester , england . the “ same girl ” was purportedly photographed in manchester but unlike the earlier photos , the depicted individual was blonde . she was not identified in the reuters image , a caption for which indicated it was taken at a crisis center in manchester city ’ s etihad stadium : <PARA> the similarities ended with hairstyles and grief - stricken expressions ( and in the latter case , the depicted woman was not a brunette ). four of the six women depicted were identified by name at the time they were photographed ( the fifth appeared to be a bystander , and the sixth unidentified ) and none was transient to the tragedies with which they were associated or disappeared afterwards : medek and soto ( relatives of victims in tragedies that were not exceptionally recent ) went on to appear in multiple photographs and interviews about the respective incidents . in subsequent iterations in paris and manchester , the conspiracy broadened in scope to suggest the “ same girl ” was jetted around the globe to visit the scenes of attacks and shootings . <PARA> shortly after the umpqua tragedy , soto remarked that the continued use of the photograph seen above in the media exacerbated her pain tremendously , and all four of the women initially depicted were likely deeply distressed by the appropriation of their personal mourning for the purposes of advancing a conspiracy narrative .	
mixture	the custom of holding observances ( including the laying of flowers on burial sites ) to remember and honor those who gave their lives in military service goes back many hundreds , if not thousands , of years . in the united states , that custom has long since been formalized in the creation of memorial day ( formerly known as decoration day ), a federal holiday observed on the last monday in may to remember the men and women who died while serving in the united states armed forces . traditionally , every year the president of the united states ( or , in his absence , another high - ranking government official ) visits arlington national cemetery on memorial day to honor all those americans who have died in military service to their country by participating in a symbolic wreath - laying ceremony at the tomb of the unknowns : <PARA> in a formal sense , the modern memorial day originated with an order issued in 1868 by maj . gen . john a . logan , the commander in chief of the grand army of the republic , for the annual decoration of war graves : <PARA> in a literal sense , it was not until 1971 that memorial day was established as a federal holiday by congress . regardless of when decoration day ( or memorial day ) may have been officially established , though , debate continues to this day regarding exactly when and where the first observance of this nature was held in the united states . in may 1966 the city of waterloo , new york , was designated as the “ birthplace of memorial day ” via a congressional resolutions and presidential proclamation commemorating a patriotic observance held in that town one hundred years earlier : <PARA> nonetheless , dozens of other places still lay claim , based on a variety of criteria , to being the true birthplace of the modern memorial day , and more recent historical studies have concluded that all of those claims ( including waterloo ’ s ) are apocryphal : <PARA> the multiplicity of sites that have claimed memorial day birthplace status for themselves are not all in the north ; many contenders are southern cities that were part of the confederacy during the civil war : <PARA> in his book race and reunion : the civil war in american memory , professor david w . blight made the case for charleston , south carolina , as memorial day ’ s birthplace , as that city was the site of an obscure ( possibly suppressed ) may 1865 event held at a racetrack turned war prison , during which freedmen properly reburied hundreds of union dead found there and then held a ceremony to dedicate the cemetery : <PARA> although contemporaneous accounts from the charleston daily courier describe and document the 1865 ceremony that took place there , and the event was one the earliest known observances similar to what we would now recognize as memorial day , whether it was truly the first such ceremony , and what influence ( if any ) it might have had on later observances , are still matters of contention . professor blight termed it “ the first memorial day ” because it predated most of the other contenders , but he noted he has no evidence that it led to general logan ’ s call for a national holiday in 1868 : “ i ’ m much more interested in the meaning that ’ s being conveyed in that incredible ritual than who ’ s first ,” he said . <PARA> in their 2014 book the genesis of the memorial day holiday , dr . richard gardiner and daniel bellware concluded that credit for the origins of memorial day should likely rest with a group of women in columbus , georgia known as the ladies memorial association , who beginning in 1866 held an annual observance originally called “ memorial day ,” then subsequently referred to as “ confederate memorial day ” after ( as referenced above ) northerners co - opted the event in 1868 and established their own memorial day .	
false	the availability of the internet as a tool to spread information quickly , cheaply , and ( mostly ) anonymously has enabled the advent of “ viral marketing ”: buzz - generating advertisements whose content is often unsuitable for traditional media ( such as television ) and is therefore distributed through “ unofficial ” channels such as social media and e - mail forwards . viral ads may not be obvious about what product they ’ re promoting , or even obvious as advertisements at all . <PARA> companies often try to obscure the connections between themselves and their viral ads , sometimes claiming that promotions were “ unauthorized ” or “ accidentally released .” though this technique may be effective in generating publicity , it can also backfire : if someone does indeed produce an unauthorized viral ad that creates negative publicity for the business it supposedly promotes , how can a company prove it wasn ’ t behind it ? this was the dilemma faced by volkswagen in 2005 regarding a viral ad seemingly calculated to offend as many human beings as possible . <PARA> the spot begins with a motorist leaving his house and hopping into his volkswagen polo — a motorist with a distinctly middle eastern appearance who sports a black - and - white checkered kaffiyeh like the one commonly associated in the public mind with the late palestinian chairman yasser arafat ( and thus , by extension , with terrorists and suicide bombers ). after a short jaunt , the driver pulls up in front of a busy restaurant with curbside seating ( as women holding babies , talking on cellphones , and just strolling down the street flash by in the background ), pulls out a detonator , and depresses the button . rather than causing widespread death and destruction , however , the muffled blast is completely contained by the car , leading to the end slogan : ‘ polo . small but tough ’: <PARA> so just who produced this offensive spot ? the advertisement didn ’ t appear to be a spoof put together by some rogue amateur filmmakers , as its production values ( e . g ., shot on 35mm film , probably at a cost in the tens of thousands of dollars ) would indicate , but paul buckett , a volkswagen spokesman , denied that the automobile manufacturer had anything to do with it : <PARA> according to the uk newspaper the guardian , the “ suicide bomber ” spot was created by the lee and dan team , a british pair who have produced a number of other advertisements ( including virals ) known for their quirkiness . the duo maintained that the clip was a self - promotional work not intended for public viewing : <PARA> others quoted by the guardian concurred with the self - promotional nature of the spot , if not necessarily about its release being an “ accident ”: <PARA> on 26 january 2004 , the guardian reported they had located the director of the clip , stuart fryer , who disputed lee and dan ’ s claim its production had cost £ 40 , 000 and affirmed that the spot was not meant for public viewing : <PARA> volkswagen also announced they would be initiating legal action against the video ’ s creators ( although nothing more was reported about the case , so we assume the idea of pursuing a lawsuit was quietly dropped ):	
true	a graphic purportedly showing the messages penned by president trump and president obama during their respective visits to yad vashem , israel ’ s memorial to the victims of the holocaust , appeared on social media in may 2017 : <PARA> this image accurately shows what trump and obama wrote in the yad vashem guest book . <PARA> president trump visited yad vashem on 23 may 2017 . he delivered a speech at the memorial and signed the guest book . haaretz , a news outlet in the middle east , posted an image of trump ’ s message : <PARA> the text of obama ’ s message is also accurate . obama visited yad vashem in july 2008 , when he was a presidential candidate . haaretz also published an image of this message : <PARA> much ado was made about the differences between the messages written by president trump and obama after visiting yad vashem . the washington post noted that trump ’ s tight schedule may have contributed to the brevity and oddly cheerful tone of his message : <PARA> in 2008 , george w . bush left an even shorter note than trump ’ s ( although without the current president ’ s signature exclamation marks ): god bless israel . <PARA> here are a few other messages penned by united states politicians in the yad vashem guest book :	
false	in august 2012 , the business and technology worlds were rocked by a decision in a patent infringement lawsuit which had a jury finding that samsung , the world ’ s largest maker of cell phones , had copied patented features of apple ’ s iphone and ipad technologies in several of its products , and awarding apple $ 1 . 05 billion in damages . <PARA> several days later , that decision was spoofed in a humor piece ( translated from the original spanish ) positing that samsung had paid off the award in nickels : <PARA> many readers who came across the article as it was circulated online mistook it for real news , even though the original and its most common reproductions were labeled as “ humor ” and “ satire .” but even for those who encountered it out of context , several aspects of the story should have stood out as implausible : <PARA> ( indeed , a judge later found the jury had miscalculated $ 400 million in damages for 13 products and ordered a new trial to determine how much samsung should pay .) <PARA> as to the hypothetical question of whether apple would be obligated to accept payment of damages in such a form , since the late 19th century pennies and nickels have been considered legal tender and are therefore “ a valid and legal offer of payment for debts when tendered to a creditor .” ( businesses selling goods or services are not required by law to accept legal tender as payment , but this particular scenario involves payment of a debt rather than a purchase of goods or services .)

true	francis ford coppola ’ s 1972 crime drama the godfather remains a hugely influential film decades after its release , and perhaps the one scene from that movie most often referenced in pop culture is one in which producer jack woltz , who unwisely refused a request from the corleone family to cast johnny fontane ( don corleone ’ s godson ) in his new film , awoke to find the severed head of his prize thoroughbred in his bed : <PARA> even those who haven ’ t actually seen the famous film itself probably recognize the godfather as the origin of the “ horse head scene ” when they encounter references to it in other works of pop culture : <PARA> the godfather was shot about a decade before the screen actors guild adopted the american humane society ’ s “ guidelines for the safe use of animals in filmed media ” [ pdf ], so it ’ s reasonable to be concerned that at least one horse was sacrificed for the film . it ’ s true that the horse ’ s head in the godfather was genuine , but untrue that the animal it came from was killed specifically for that scene : <PARA> the authenticity of the horse ’ s head was addressed by coppola after the 2001 release of the godfather dvd collection , in which the filmmaker recalled that animal rights activists were troubled by the imagery : <PARA> and so one of the most memorable scenes in movie history was born . <PARA> another movie ’ s animals were perhaps not so lucky . pernicious , but unverified rumors about the 1970 motion picture patton claim that mules were shot , clubbed to death , or poisoned during its filming — charges that 20th - century fox vehemently denied .

false	an 25 april 2017 , an image purportedly showing a “ water - bending squirrel ” made waves on social media after it was posted to a twitter account called “ fascinating pictures ”. it is , indeed , a fascinating picture , appearing to show a squirrel apparently using katara - esque powers to bend a stream of water over its head . <PARA> as fascinating as it is , the image was digitally manipulated : it was created in 2014 in the “ photoshopbattles ” reddit community , and was based off a 2010 photograph taken by 500px user serge a . the original image , which showed the squirrel with its arms crossed but not the stream of water arching over its head , was entitled “ kung fu squirrel .” <PARA> reddit user the6ftpianist explained how the image , which was originally dubbed “ northern water squirrel ”, was created : <PARA> here ’ s a look at the water bending squirrel ( right ), the original “ kung fu ” squirrel ( center ), and the stock water splash image ( left ) that was used to create the viral image : <PARA> while we cannot definitively say that a squirrel that can bend streams of water with its mind does not exist ( we have never seen proof that they can ’ t ), this rodent ’ s magic was made with nothing more than photoshop .	
false	a meme purporting to show a disheveled president donald trump looking at his phone at mar - a - lago appeared in april 2017 : <PARA> every claim offered by this meme is incorrect , as the man pictured is not actually donald trump , this picture was not taken at mar - a - lago , and the device the man is holding does not appear capable of tweeting . <PARA> the original image , which showed an unflattering view of a man ( not donald trump ) sitting on a bench , has been circulating online since at least 2008 . his face and hair were later altered in the image , in order to make it appear as though the pictured man was trump himself . here ’ s a comparison between the original image ( left ) and the doctored image ( right ): <PARA> this photograph was also not taken at mar - a - lago . although we have not pinpointed the exact location of this image , it was most likely taken during a music festival in sweden , as the man pictured appears to be swedish musician gula gubben . an eerily similar picture of guben at the this is hultsfred festival in 2013 can be seen here . <PARA> lastly , the device that the man is holding in this photograph does not appear to be a phone capable of sending a tweet . even if he were , trump did not join twitter until 2009 , a year after the original image first appeared .

unproven	on 19 april 2017 , palmerreport . com posted a story reporting the claim that the federal bureau of investigations has information that the kremlin has “ kompromat ,” or compromising information , that could be used for blackmail , on utah republican rep . jason chaffetz . <PARA> the article cites only a tweet by former british parliament member louise mensch , who cites unnamed “ sources ”: <PARA> mensch ’ s tweet got a lot of attention , and was even retweeted by a spokeswoman for the democratic party : <PARA> the fbi as standard practice does not comment on ongoing investigations , except under extremely unusual circumstances . true to form , they declined to comment when we asked them to verify whether they were aware of “ kompromat ” on chaffetz . <PARA> chaffetz , who chairs the house oversight committee , posted a statement on his official facebook page on 19 april 2017 , announcing his decision not to seek reelection . chaffetz cited personal reasons for declining to run and said he may campaign again in the future , but would not do so in 2018 . <PARA> the washington post speculated he may be preparing for a gubernatorial run , citing comments he made in 2016 in which he showed strong interest in that role . on 3 january 2016 , chaffetz telegraphed such a move to the deseret news when he said : <PARA> we found no proof that the russians have compromising information on chaffetz , as the claim is entirely based on hearsay without any supporting evidence offered . congress is currently on recess and we have not yet heard back from chaffetz ’ spokesperson .	
false	nabisco has released several interesting varieties of oreo brand cookies over the years ( swedish fish , anyone ?), so it wasn ’ t too surprising that some fans accepted as genuine an image they encountered online purportedly showing the company ’ s latest offering — graeter ’ s black raspberry chocolate chip oreos : <PARA> however , this image did not originate with nabsico , the division of mondelēz international that produces oreos , nor with graeter ’ s , an artisanal ice cream company . it was a “ wish - list item ” originally posted on the instagram page “ the junk food aisle ,” along with a plea for nabsico to “ make this happen ”: <PARA> this is hardly the first “ new flavor ” oreos image to catch the attention of cookie aficionados . although hoax flavors such as fried chicken oreos , spam oreos , and butterbeer oreos quickly disappeared into internet obscurity , nabisco has produced at least one oreos variety ( red velvet oreos ) that initially appeared as an online rumor .	
mixture	in mid - april 2017 , multiple online sources reported that former u . s . state department employee candace claiborne ( purportedly an employee of barack obama or hillary clinton ) was arrested on charges of treason : <PARA> the indictment in question was real , although many online reports covering it were inaccurate . claiborne was arrested on specific charges related to improperly receiving gifts in exchange for her providing information to chinese agents — “ obstructing an official proceeding ” and “ making false statements to the f . b . i .” — not “ treason ,” as noted in a justice department press release about the case : <PARA> claiborne wasn ’ t an “ employee ” of barack obama or hillary clinton , other than in the sense that she held a mid - level ( not a “ deep state operative ”) job at the state department , which was headed by clinton from 2009 - 2013 ( in her position as secretary of state ) and is a part of the executive branch , which was headed by barack obama from 2009 - 2017 ( in his position as president of the united states ). by that standard , claiborne would also have been an “ employee ” of donald trump and rex tillerson , as the affidavit that accompanied the criminal complaint against her noted she was still working for the state department at the time of her arrest : <PARA> candace claiborne pled “ not guilty ” at her 29 march 2017 court appearance , and a preliminary hearing for her case was scheduled for 18 april 2017 .	
false	although frijoles is the spanish word for beans , in the united states frijoles is sometimes used to refer to a particular type of bean - based dish , one which is commonly eaten as a dip with corn tortilla chips , served as a side dish in mexican restaurants , and used in the preparation of other mexican foods ( such as tostadas and chimichangas ). that dish is typically prepared by cooking beans in a manner that infuses them with moisture ( e . g ., simmering , stewing , or pressure cooking them , possibly soaking them in water overnight first ), mashing them into a paste , and frying them with lard . <PARA> the standard english - language name for this culinary concoction is “ refried beans ,” a term that has given many people ( myself included ) pause to ponder the question : “ why would beans need to be fried more than once ?” the answer is that the beans in “ refried beans ” aren ’ t really fried multiple times ; the english name came about through a mistranslation from spanish . <PARA> the dish we english speakers know as refried beans is called frijoles refritos in spanish : frijole being the spanish word for “ bean ,” and “ frito ” being a spanish adjective meaning “ fried .” the translation error came about through the mistaken assumption that the prefix re - means in the same thing in spanish as it does in english . although placing re - before an english verb is a common way of indicating an action undertaken more than once ( e . g ., reschedule , reassign , redistribute ), in spanish that prefix is sometimes used as a form of emphasis . therefore frijoles refritos are not beans that have been fried multiple times , but rather beans that have been well - fried , as diana kennedy explained in the cuisines of mexico :	
false	for nearly twenty years now , internet users have been immersed in warnings advising them to be wary of persons attempting to sell perfume in store parking lots : <PARA> the scenario described above isn ’ t a real danger . no one has reported having been robbed in this manner , save for one woman in 1999 whose claim was suspect ( for reasons we discuss below ). this legend doesn ’ t even describe a plausible scenario because , despite what books and television shows may depict , rendering a person unconscious from a mere sniff or two of some substance is not easy to do . ether is nasty , volatile stuff that requires a great deal more than a few brief inhalations to knock a person out . in fact , it ’ s hard to think of any substance that could produce the instant unconsciousness described here . <PARA> this legend appears to have begun in late 1999 with a widely - circulated internet message that used one specific news report as a basis for implying that ether - wielding robbers were a potentially widespread menace : <PARA> the incident described above was “ real ” in the sense that a mobile , alabama , woman claimed it happened to her on 8 november 1999 and reported the alleged robbery to the police , but it ’ s false in that no evidence ever surfaced to verify her story . <PARA> bertha johnson , a 54 - year - old mobile woman , maintained that at about 2 : 00 pm on monday , 8 november , she had pulled into the parking lot of a bank when a woman approached her car and offered to sell her bottles of cologne that ordinarily retail for $ 45 for the low price of $ 8 . ms . johnson says she sniffed a sample of the cologne , and the next thing she knew it was around half an hour later , she was standing with her keys in her hand at a wicker store two miles away from the bank , her head was throbbing , and $ 800 she had been carrying ($ 500 of her own money plus $ 300 of her employer ’ s ) was missing . however , her claim had some surface implausibilities : <PARA> sure enough , several weeks later the toxicology reports concerning tests run on blood and urine samples taken from ms . johnson immediately after the alleged attack did not indicate the presence of any unusual or abnormal substance in her system . the case remained officially open , but this one smelled like a scam cooked up by ms . johnson to abscond with her employer ’ s money . <PARA> now , in true urban legend fashion , this tale has gone from a news report of an alleged victim ’ s unsubstantiated story to a general warning that this sort of thing might happen to you to a specific warning that this type of robbery is actually happening . it isn ’ t happening though , and it probably never did , not even once . <PARA> it ’ s interesting to see how little occurrences that aren ’ t even part of the scenario described are now being reported as evidence of narrow brushes with these non - existent robbers . for example , the following was prefaced to one e - mailed example : <PARA> now , men asking passing women about the perfume they ’ re wearing isn ’ t at all the same thing as crooks using rigged perfume bottles to knock out their victims . the fact is , some companies ( such as scentura ) do hire people to sell perfume door - to - door or in parking lots , and some of these salespeople do indeed work in pairs , pitch their wares from cars , and employ aggressive sales tactics ( which include approaching women and asking them what kind of perfume they have on ). but now that this legend is circulating , people dutifully report any sighting of perfume - selling strangers in parking lots as “ proof ” of this fictional crime wave of ether - bearing robbers being real . <PARA> indeed , we routinely receive e - mails from women who have had encounters with folks vending perfume in parking lots and who have concluded ( based on nothing but spurious rumor ) that they were about to be robbed . they write to report we ’ re all wrong about this sort of robbery not taking place because hadn ’ t they themselves almost had it happen to them ? that no “ knockout potions ” were offered to them and no robberies ( completed or attempted ) took place does little to dissuade them from their certainty that they came within a hair ’ s breadth of harm at the hands of some innocent freelance perfume sellers . <PARA> we wrote the original article about this rumor in 2000 . as far along as april 2006 , alabama police were still having to field reports on this non - existent form of crime and inform the public that it ’ s a hoax : <PARA> since 2000 ( when we wrote our original article ), we ’ ve been keeping our ears and eyes open for news of any instances of this sort of robbery happening in real life . so far , the closest thing to arise is a july 2008 case in a town in louisiana . <PARA> in houma , louisiana , a woman named patches wegmann was arrested after two men she plied with cologne claimed to have suffered ill effects from what she ’ d had them breathe in . the first said she accosted him , sprayed a cologne sample on a piece of paper , and waved it under his nose . subsequently , after he returned to work , he passed out , his symptoms including dizziness , shortness of breath , and numbness in his extremities . the second said the cologne ’ s fumes left him feeling light - headed , and it irritated his skin . <PARA> wegmann was charged with second - degree battery and unlawful solicitation , but the battery charge has to do with forcing perfume samples upon unwilling parties , not because there was anything necessarily noxious in the substance she forced upon them . the incident remains under investigation , and authorities say it ’ s not clear that anything other than perfume was sprayed on either man . <PARA> in 2001 a false internet rumor about seven women having died after sniffing perfume samples sent to them in the mail spread in the wake of the september 11 attacks . this newer rumor was a combination of two older and equally baseless scares : the 1999 “ perfume robbers ” tale ( which is the topic of the article above ) and the 2000 klingerman virus warning about blue virus - laden sponges mailed in envelopes marked “ a gift for you from the klingerman foundation ” which supposedly caused 23 deaths . the 2001 “ deadly perfume samples ” rumor brought into play the specter of lurking terrorists using the u . s . mail system to murder the innocent in a women - targeted replay of the anthrax mailings horror . the “ deadly perfume samples ” rumor is distinct and indeed far removed from the “ perfume robbers ” one , yet folks are prone to confuse the two because they both use the word ‘ perfume .’

mixture	in march 2017 , several english - language publications such as the mirror and daily mail caught wind of an alleged internet game that was tricking children in russia into harming themselves by giving them “ instructions ” on how to become a fairy : <PARA> this report does have some truth . a meme containing “ instructions ” on how to become a fairy has circulated on russian social media sites such as vk . com , and at least one child was reportedly harmed after attempting to become a “ fairy ”. however , subsequent reports filed under sensational titles such as “ sinister ‘ fire fairy ’ craze tells kids to switch on their stoves and burn themselves ” and “ 5 - year - old badly burned after trying “ fire fairy ” challenge ” left many readers with some false impressions about this so - called game . <PARA> here ’ s a look at what this “ fire fairy ” game is and what it isn ’ t . <PARA> how do you become a fairy ? what ’ s this all about ? <PARA> this image contains a series of steps children can reportedly take in order to become a fairy . the instructions start out simple and innocent enough ( spin three times and say magic words ) but quickly devolve into something more dangerous . here is a rough translation of the meme provided by the mirror : <PARA> the two fairies shown are characters from the winx club : school of fairies series : <PARA> the concern is that young fans of the show could encounter these potentially deadly instructions while searching for “ how to become a fairy ” online . <PARA> how many children have been harmed ? <PARA> we were only able to find one report of a child coming to harm while trying to become a “ fire fairy ”. the russian web site pg21 . ru reported in june 2016 that a five - year - old in cheboksary , russia suffered severe burns after watching the winx cartoon : <PARA> the initial report did not mention the meme ( the child ’ s actions do not not match the instructions ), but a report from ria . ru did link the incident to the “ fire fairy ” game . at least one other report was circulated on vk . com about a parent discovering their child attempting to become a fairy , but that incident has not been confirmed , nor did it result in any injuries . <PARA> is this a new craze ? <PARA> humorous messages detailing different ways to become a fairy have been circulating on vk . com for several years . ria . ru traced these “ jokes ” back to 2013 and found that the instructions ranged from innocent ( make a fairy wish ) to playful ( place your hand in a bowl of ice water ) to absurd ( spread toothpaste on your hands ). <PARA> these jokes eventually grew more dramatic , and in 2014 the meme appeared in a popular youtube video . however , ria . ru described the creator of the video as “ sarcastic ,” implying that even though it contains potentially deadly instructions , it was most likely originally meant as a joke , and was not intended to actually inflict harm . <PARA> alexander arkhipov of the russian academy of science said that the “ fire fairy ” rumor was popularized in 2015 , when russian clothing chain gulliver held a competition asking people “ how to become the fairy winx ”: <PARA> regardless of the original intent of the image , it is not accurate to describe this meme as new , as it has been circulating for several years , and reports about children using these instructions are scarce . <PARA> did the winx club create these instructions ? <PARA> the meme was designed to look as if it was an official graphic from winx club , which is not the case . iginio straffi , chief executive of rainbow ( the company responsible for the winx club brand ) condemned the message , asking moscow prosecutors to open a criminal case against those responsible for its creation : <PARA> are children harming themselves because of this “ fire fairy ” game ? <PARA> the meme does contain a potentially deadly set of instructions , and since was modeled after a popular cartoon , there is legitimate concern that children may be fooled into harming themselves as they attempt to “ become a fairy .” in fact , at least one child has already been severely burned . however , it is not accurate to say that this is a “ new craze ” or that it has harmed multiple children .	
false	a fabricated story about philippines vice president leonor “ leni ” robredo being barred from traveling to the u . s . illustrates how fake sites are proliferating in countries outside the u . s . the story was originally published on 19 march 2017 on “ al jazeera channel ,” a knockoff of the actual al jazeera news outlet . it was later reprinted nearly verbatim on another web site , pinoytribune . com : <PARA> the story hinges on tensions between vice president robredo and president rodrigo duterte . unlike her american counterpart mike pence , liberal party member robredo won her office in a separate election from the president . she is also a member of a different party than duterte , who is from the pdf - lapan party . <PARA> while the story accuses robredo of engaging in a “ continued effort to destabilize the government ,” duterte contradicted that premise six days after the story was published , saying that he did not believe she was involved in any efforts to make his administration seem “ unpopular .” however , a spokesperson for his office suggested on 24 march 2017 that robredo was involved with an impeachment complaint filed against duterte by rep . gary alejano of the magdalo party . <PARA> in july 2016 , robredo accepted duterte ’ s offer to head the national housing and urban development coordinating council , a cabinet - level position . but she resigned from the cabinet that december , saying that duterte had ordered her to stop attending meetings : <PARA> later that month , duterte said he barred her from cabinet meetings because she had joined rallies calling for him to leave office . the two did sit together while attending the philippine national police academy commencement ceremony in the silang municipality on 24 march 2017 . <PARA> we have contacted robredo ’ s office seeking comment on both the fake story about the sanctions and the spread of fake news sites in her country .	
false	on 3 march 2017 , a blog titled “ this talk ain ’ t cheap ” published an account of a family ’ s experience with the diy craft phenomenon known as “ slime ,” a goo made from white glue , borax , shaving cream , and water . in the piece , titled “ beware of homemade slime ,” the author recounted how her daughter had come down with a series of symptoms , including headache and respiratory problems , with no clear cause . but when they removed all the slime and slime - related products from their house , however , her daughter immediately became healthy : <PARA> while we cannot speak to the specific mechanism behind the daughter ’ s ailment , it is not impossible that one or more ingredients of slime may contributed in some way . everyone reacts differently to certain compounds , and sensitivity to one of the compounds present in slime is a possibility . furthermore , if the daughter was frequently in contact with dry borax , it is possible that compound could have contributed to respiratory problems ( just like any other fine particulate powder ) or skin irritation . <PARA> additionally , as a solution of borax necessarily produces boric acid , improper dilution can also lead to skin irritation and even , as has been reported , serious burns . <PARA> unfortunately , the post went on to list myriad other possible health risks of slime , borrowing heavily from information presented by the british tabloid daily mail and other questionable sources , many of which are either completely false , or generally misleading . these claims include : <PARA> potential harm from borax <PARA> there is a kernel of truth the claims made about borax ( aka sodium borate ). it is indeed toxic if ingested , but an ordinarily healthy person would need to ingest a relatively large amount of it to suffer serious health effects . some governmental bodies , including the government of canada , have recommended against borax ’ s use in children ’ s craft projects , citing concerns about the cumulative effects of long - term exposure from both natural and unnatural sources . <PARA> this move likely reflects an abundance of caution . a comprehensive review of the toxicity of borate - based products in humans concluded that the doses required to create any genotoxic or acute toxic effects are absurdly unrealistic : <PARA> a separate detailed review of studies on both humans and laboratory animals , concerned specifically with human developmental and reproductive toxicity , similarly concluded that “ the typical human exposures are below the minimum level considered to be adverse to reproduction .” <PARA> additionally , the above - cited work all assumes actual consumption of borax , as it does not easily pass through unbroken skin . considering that a ) the goal is not to eat the slime , and b ) the recipe calls for about 1g diluted in 20 ml of water , the use of borax in slime does not represent a realistic toxic , genotoxic , or reproductive health risk . <PARA> potential harm from elmer ’ s glue - all <PARA> in the “ this talk ain ’ t cheap ” post , the author linked to fact sheet about household glue poisoning from medlineplus ( a program of the national institutes of health ). that post explicitly stated that “ most household glues , such as elmer ’ s glue - all , are not poisonous .” <PARA> all of the symptoms listed in the facebook post , sourced from this fact sheet , concern glue that contains volatile organic compounds ( ethanol , xylene , light aliphatic naphtha , n - hexane , toluene ) that elmer ’ s glue ( or other “ white glue ”) does not contain . <PARA> potential harm from shaving cream <PARA> to support claims that shaving cream is dangerous , the author cites a “ howstuffworks ” post titled “ are there harmful chemicals in shaving cream ?” that article highlights a number of chemicals it states can cause harm , but it does so inaccurately and with misleading information : <PARA> these ingredients ( though not nitrosamines ) are all listed as present in the commonly used barbasol brand of shaving cream , but the statement of their risks as it relates to homemade slime is not accurate or largely misleading . <PARA> the howstuffworks post states that “ propolene [ sic ] glycol is a humectant like glycerin , but unlike glycerin , it ’ s more frequently found in antifreeze and brake fluid .” while using the term “ antifreeze ” is a popular scare tactic for those inclined to chemophobia , propylene glycol is not toxic to humans in any relevant dose . while propylene glycol is a mild skin irritant to some people , it is recognized as safe for both food and cosmetic use . <PARA> with regard to triethanolamine ( tea ), that post stated “ it ’ s also a very controversial ingredient in the cosmetic industry because not only is it a skin irritant , but many formulas containing tea are found to be contaminated with nitrosamines , which are linked to cancer .” <PARA> while tea may also be a skin irritant to some ( though clearly not enough to produce a massive epidemic of unshaved men ), the jump to nitrosamines — which are unequivocally carcinogenic — is , again , misleading . <PARA> nitrosamines are not added to cosmetics but are instead formed when amines ( a chemical commonly found in proteins ) mix with a nitrosating chemical ( a chemical that , generally speaking , adds a nitrate group to its chemical structure ). because nitrosamines form through natural physical processes , they occur in nature and in low quantities ubiquitously . in an effort to prevent their formation in cosmetics , governmental regulators such as the fda and the european union scientific committee on consumer safety have placed strict requirements to mitigate their formation and have enacted associated testing and monitoring requirements . is it possible that there are nitrosamines in shaving cream ? yes . but if nitrosamines even in small quantities were dangerous , then one would also have to avoid , according to a 1990 review , “ bacon , ham , frankfurters , sausage , cured meat products , poultry , fish , and fish products , cheese , beer , malt , grain , margarine , edible vegetable oils , water , air , and soil .” <PARA> finally , the howstuffworks post discussed two sulphate compounds : <PARA> both sls and sles can , like any detergent compound that removes oil from your skin , cause irritation . the claim that sls interacts with estrogen in humans is not found in any of the 3 , 155 scientific articles listed on the pubchem website for the chemical , nor in any of the 306 articles in the national institute of health ’ s curated list of research related to sls ’ s adverse effects . <PARA> the argument regarding dioxane is similar to the nitrosamine argument above , as the compound can introduced as an impurity during synthesis of the above sulfate compounds . its presence in many cosmetics , as well as its carcinogenicity , are not in question . however , at concentrations found even in the most egregiously contaminated shaving creams ( further diluted by other slime ingredients ), it would not pose a credible health risk . <PARA> while we cannot rank the specific personal circumstances described in the “ this talk ain ’ t cheap ” post , we can say that claims of other more terrifying slime - related health concerns are not rooted in reality , so long as one is not actively eating the final product or breathing copious amounts of dry borax during its production .	
false	on 16 march 2017 , the web site newslo published an article positing that u . s . secretary of health and human services tom price had said that it would be better for the federal budget if cancer patients died quickly : <PARA> this quote was not a genuine statement issued by secretary price . it originated with newslo , a “ hybrid ” web site that publishes articles containing a mixture of fact and fiction : <PARA> the web site ’ s hybrid articles are accompanied by two buttons labeled “ show facts ” and “ hide facts ” that allow readers to see which parts of an article are factual and which parts are fictional . in this case , pressing the “ show facts ” button highlighted the introductory paragraph of the article , indicating that the remainder of the article , the portion containing the fake price quote , was fictional : <PARA> newslo is a rather prolific purveyor of fake news , having previously penned articles containing fake quotes from steve bannon , kellyanne conway , and mike pence .	
false	a rumor holding that ohio ’ s cedar point amusement park ( billed as “ the roller coaster capital of the world ”) would not be reopening for the upcoming tourist season on 6 may 2017 , as scheduled , has been widely circulated on facebook . allegedly , the park would remain shuttered for the year to complete safety upgrades stemming from a 2015 accident in which a man was struck and killed by the park ’ s raptor roller coaster : <PARA> although this image resembles a genuine news item link , facebook users who clicked on it were not redirected to a news article about cedar point . rather , they were greeted with an image informing them that they had been “ owned ” in a facebook prank : <PARA> cedar point did not announce they wouldn ’ t be reopening in 2017 due to safety concerns , a point they attempted to clear up in a facebook post : <PARA> prank news sites enable users to generate hoaxes designed to trick their friends on social media . however , generalized hoaxes such as this one about cedar point ’ s remaining shuttered tend to quickly move outside any one user ’ s group of friends and end up shared broadly on social media platforms . <PARA> “ pranks ” similar to the one that caused concern about cedar park are rather popular on social media , such as one holding that netflix would be shutting down due to too much account sharing . prank sites have also recently helped spread death hoaxes about actors andrew lincoln and william h . macy .

false	as democrats and republicans scuffle over a republican proposal to repeal and replace former president barack obama ’ s healthcare legislation ( the affordable care act , also colloquially called obamacare ), many confused a grandiosely - titled alternative put forward by a texas congressman for the legislation backed by the current president and party majority . <PARA> on 1 march 2017 , rep . pete sessions , a texas republican , put forward his version of a healthcare bill with the cheeky title : “ world ’ s greatest healthcare plan of 2017 ”. it is not the same one being considered by the majority of republicans to replace the affordable care act , which is more soberly named “ american health care reform act of 2017 ”, and was introduced on 4 january 2017 . <PARA> although the two bills are separate and distinct , it hasn ’ t stopped many from conflating them , with much of the confusion happening on social media : <PARA> although sessions ’ bill got the most attention in early march 2017 ( possibly due to the rumor that republicans were trying to eliminate the current healthcare plan with a trumpian - sounding title ) it is not new . the u . s . representative from texas partnered with louisiana sen . bill cassidy , and the two first introduced it in 2016 . that version was presented as an alternative to obamacare , which sessions had told the atlantic was a “ compromise ”: <PARA> meanwhile , lawmakers and various organizations with a stake in healthcare are fighting it out over the bill backed by president trump and house speaker paul ryan : <PARA> while a bill entitled “ world ’ s greatest healthcare plan ” was introduced to the 115th congress by u . s . rep . sessions , it is not the one backed by the president and the majority of republicans .	
false	on 4 march 2017 , the web site the last line of defense published an article positing that a warrant had been issued for the arrest of former president barack obama over the ( unsubstantiated ) claim that he had illegally ordered wiretapping of telephones at trump tower prior to the 2016 u . s . presidential election : <PARA> none of this was true . barack obama was not arrested , nor was a warrant issued for his arrest . no fbi spokesman named “ todd mcmartin ” made a statement about obama ’ s supposed imminent arrest to fox news , nor to any other news organization ( and an fbi spokesman would not be able to publicly comment on an investigation in progress in any case ). and , of course , the notion that president trump could order a wiretap solely via executive order to incriminate another president who ordered a wiretap without a federal order “ legally authorized by a judge ” is an amusing irony . <PARA> this “ news ” about barack obama ’ s imminent arrest originated with the last line of defense , a well known “ satirical ” ( i . e ., fake news ) web site whose disclaimer notes that : <PARA> the last line of defense followed up this spoof article the following day with another fabricated piece detailing obama ’ s supposed arrest in canada : <PARA> the story re - emerged in late march 2017when it was picked up by dubious aggregator sites , but remains false .	
false	beginning in late june 2016 , a number of unreliable web sites in africa and elsewhere published articles reporting that the nordic country of iceland was experiencing a shortage of men , and had thus offered a stipend of $ 5 , 000 per month to immigrants willing to marry icelandic women . <PARA> the first of these , as best we can tell , was a blog called the spirit whispers , where someone posted a barely decipherable entry reading as follows : <PARA> as it turned out , many male readers were , in fact , interested in the offer and did not stop at leaving a comment . “ over at least the past week now ,” the icelandic web site the reykjavík grapevine reported , “ numerous icelandic women on facebook have attested to being practically spammed with friend requests from non - icelandic men that they do not know .” <PARA> the web site labeled the immigrant invite a hoax , pointing out that according to the latest population data , iceland has a surfeit of men , not women , and the icelandic government has never offered grants to immigrants for marrying icelanders , regardless of gender . <PARA> the danish embassy in egypt , which handles icelandic affairs in the region , apparently became so fed up with inquiries from men wanting to take part in the scheme that officials posted a disavowal of the rumor on facebook :	
false	on 21 february 2017 , web site dailykos . com shared a photograph of white house advisor stephen miller , along with a claim that the image clearly shows him using a hand gesture that signifies white nationalism : <PARA> twitter users also shared this image of miller alongside pictures of gang symbols taken by the anti - defamation league : <PARA> the photograph was taken on 12 february 2017 by reuters photographer joshua roberts , shortly before miller appeared on face the nation : “ senior white house advisor stephen miller waits to go on the air in the white house briefing room in washington , u . s ., february 12 , 2017 .” <PARA> it is impossible to tell , in the absence of additional images or video to use for comparison purposes whether miller was deliberately using a hand gesture of any sort or whether this picture simply captured him during a fleeting moment while he was adjusting his tie and jacket . we have reached out to roberts to see if any such footage is available . <PARA> however , the position of miller ’ s hands do not match the white power hand symbol image provided by the adl : <PARA> while miller ’ s right hand may resemble a “ w ”, it is a stretch to say that his left hand resembles a “ p ”. miller ’ s gesture more closely resembled the aryan circle ’ s hand symbol , although this would be problematic : the aryan circle is a white supremacist prison gang , and as far as we know miller has never been in prison ( generally a prerequisite for prison gang membership ). furthermore , the symbol ( per the adl ) consists of holding up the thumb and the middle , ring , and little fingers of one hand , signifying the numbers 1 and 3 , yet miller ’ s thumb is not raised : <PARA> anti - defamation league senior researcher mark pitcavage told us that the claim is not credible : <PARA> evidence that miller was actually using a controversial gesture is slight at best , and most likely the image simply captured him in the act of adjusting his outfit just before appearing on camera . <PARA> in september 2018 , the same claim was made of zina bash during the confirmation hearings for trump supreme court nominee judge brett kavanaugh :

false	on 2 february 2017 , a public notification of an ofac general license published by the united states treasury department noting that sanctions against the russian security agency federalnaya sluzhba bezopasnosti would be tweaked to ease the burden on u . s . tech companies selling goods inside russia caused some ( including house minority leader nancy pelosi ) to sound the alarm that president donald trump had “ eased ” sanctions against russia . some appeared to assume the move was a sign that favor curried by russian president vladimir putin with the new u . s . president had paid off . pelosi released a statement that reads : <PARA> that statement and others similar to it are not based in fact , according to foreign affairs and trade experts . the treasury authorization reads : <PARA> while president trump ’ s friendly overtures toward putin and reports that russian hacking had influenced the presidential election had raised fears about foreign intervention in the latter part of 2016 , the recent activity by the u . s treasury department was only a tweak to allow american companies to continue commerce in russia unharmed , not a sign of nefarious activity . <PARA> doug jacobson , an attorney with jacobson burton kelley pllc , a washington , dc - based law firm that advises companies on international trade law , explained that it is meant to allow american companies “ to obtain licenses and approvals from fsb to import certain software and it equipment containing encryption into russia ” — but it does not mean they are now allowed to sell directly to the fsb nor does it represent a lifting or easing of sanctions : <PARA> ankit panda , a foreign affairs analyst who edits at the diplomat , told us the move was a routine update to the sanctions that was planned by trump ’ s predecessor , president barack obama , in response to u . s . industry concerns raised after sanctions were put in place in retribution for hacking : <PARA> the fear generated by the announcement , he said , was a “ signal - noise ” problem created by the current political environment , although the treasury action was “ something that ’ s quite normal that ’ s getting blown out of proportion given the poor timing / optics of ‘ sanctions relief ’ for russia .” he noted that the hysteria was a result of anxiety hanging over from the 2016 election , coupled with recent news of a friendly phone call between presidents trump and putin and a spike in military violence between russia and ukraine . <PARA> the russian government pounced on the opportunity to further misinformation and politicize the routine treasury move , with russian government - owned media boasting : <PARA> as reuters reported , this is a misrepresentation , and the treasury action was more on behalf of u . s . business interests than anything else : <PARA> sam cutler , a senior analyst at horizon client access , told us that the misplaced outrage is not helping with sober discussion of a weighty and complicated issue : <PARA> we have not yet received a response from the u . s . treasury department or from pelosi .	
false	on 2 february 2017 , president trump issued a proclamation honoring february as “ african - american history month ”: <PARA> web sites such as the tmz gossip site noticed that president trump ’ s proclamation used the term “ african - american history month ” instead of “ black history month ” and published an item stating that he had “ changed the name ” of the month - long observance . tmz even went as far as stating that “ every u . s . president since 1976 had designated february as black history month ... same sentiment , different name ?” <PARA> although it ’ s true that president trump used the term “ african - american history month ” in his proclamation , it ’ s disingenuous to say that he “ renamed ” the observance or to suggest that he was the first president to apply that terminology . in fact , the terms “ black history month ” and “ african - american history month ” have been nearly interchangeable since president gerald ford issued the first proclamation concerning the observance . <PARA> president ford used the term “ black history month ” in 1976 , but bill clinton , barack obama , and george w . bush all used the term “ national african american history ” month in at least one of their yearly proclamations . jimmy carter , george h . w . bush and ronald reagan , on the other hand , used a combination of the two terms and honored “ national afro - american ( black ) history month .” <PARA> legislation concerning the month - long observance has also gone back and forth between the two descriptors . in 1996 , the u . s . senate passed a resolution commemorating “ black history month and contributions of african - american united states senators ,” but when congress passed a similar measure in 1986 designating february as a national month of observance , they employed the term “ black ( afro - american ) history month .” <PARA> tmz edited their article to state that “ donald trump , turns out , did not officially change black history month to national african american history month ... it ’ s been that way for decades .”	
false	on 28 january 2017 , protests erupted at airports across the united states over president donald trump ’ s issuance of a executive order temporarily banning immigration from seven countries . in a 29 january 2017 statement , he said : <PARA> supporters of the ban claimed that no such protests had occurred when president obama purportedly banned visas for refugees in 2011 : <PARA> however , on 24 july 2011 the new york times reported a slowdown ( but not a ban ) on visas for iraqis : <PARA> a 20 november 2013 abc news piece reported that as a result of the kentucky case , the state department stopped processing iraqi refugees for six months . there was some pushback ; according to reports , the obama administration tweaked the special immigrant visa process as a result ( but would not divulge what changes they had made ). <PARA> by contrast , president trump ’ s 27 january 2017 executive order called for a temporary ban on entry from seven nations that are purportedly detrimental to the interests of the united states , but with no supporting evidence cited : <PARA> the 2011 state department slowdown on processing asylum requests from iraq was covered in great depth by news organizations , most frequently from a perspective critical of president obama ’ s federal government leaving american assets in iraq unprotected as nearly 60 , 000 applications were reviewed more extensively : <PARA> in 2015 , the wall street journal followed up with an article about a lawsuit filed on behalf of applicants who claimed their lives were put at risk during the 2011 delays . following president trump ’ s 29 january 2017 statement comparing his order to president obama ’ s , foreign policy reported that the ban differed on five material points : <PARA> although it is true that the state department ’ s enhanced review of applications from iraq in 2011 slowed their processing time significantly , president barack obama did not ban or completely stop all entry from one ( or seven ) countries .	
mixture	on 27 january 2017 president donald trump issued an unnumbered executive order titled “ protecting the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the united states ,” widely described as a “ muslim ban ” targeting travelers to the u . s . from seven specific muslim - majority countries . the order prompted controversy and protests across the united states amid widespread confusion about its contents and the manner in which it might be enforced . <PARA> an article by seth j . frantzman asserted countries affected by the order were not selected by president trump and were in fact pinpointed as areas of concern in late 2015 , during the administration of president barack obama : <PARA> frantzman was correct ( as was mic .) about the absence of the names of seven countries from president trump ’ s order : iraq , iran , libya , somalia , sudan and yemen were not specifically cited in president trump ’ s 27 january 2017 executive order , which held : <PARA> president trump ’ s order appeared to have roots in the “ visa waiver program improvement and terrorist travel prevention act of 2015 ,” the passage of which was reported in late 2015 and early 2016 as a response to shootings and terrorist attacks in san bernardino and paris in november 2015 . although president obama did in fact sign the bill into law in december 2015 , it was attached as a rider on the consolidated appropriations act of 2016 , an omnibus spending bill : <PARA> h . r . 158 did not actually block travel or immigration by residents or citizens of any particular countries ; rather , it terminated travel privileges afforded persons previously covered under the visa waiver program , as described in a letter sent by the american civil liberties union ( aclu ) to members of congress objecting to the bill : <PARA> an article about the bill from the center for immigration studies ( cis ) also noted that it didn ’ t bar entry to the u . s . by persons traveling from certain areas of concern ; it merely changed the process by which they must apply for visas : <PARA> on 18 february 2016 the department of homeland security ( dhs ) identified three additional countries ( bringing the total to seven ) that would also be covered by the limitations on visa waiver program travel : <PARA> as of november 2016 ( before president trump ’ s 20 january 2017 inauguration ), a u . s . customs & border protection faq page affirmed that travel restrictions remained in place for those specific seven countries but also noted that those “ restrictions do not bar travel to the united states ”: <PARA> president trump ’ s 27 january 2017 executive order mentioned only syria by name ; the six other countries associated with it were ones that had been identified by dhs as “ of concern ” as early as december 2015 .	
true	on 27 january 2017 , president donald trump signed an executive order entitled “ protection of the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the united states ,” which barred entry to the u . s . for foreign nationals from certain countries associated with terrorism . <PARA> cnn reported : <PARA> all seven countries targeted by the ban are muslim majority nations . trump ’ s order stipulated that christians and adherents of other minority religions be given priority over muslims , the new york times reported . the measures are part of president trump ’ s promised “ extreme vetting measures ” designed to keep terrorists out of the united states : <PARA> human rights groups condemned the order as an instance of religious persecution . the american civil liberties union labeled it a “ euphemism for discriminating against muslims .” <PARA> as president trump signed the order , vice president mike pence stood behind him and applauded . hours later , a tweet purportedly sent by then - governor of indiana mike pence on 8 december 2015 was resurrected and shared online as proof he had once vehemently disagreed with trump on the issue of banning entry to the united states on the basis of religion : <PARA> the tweet , sent from pence ’ s verified twitter account , was authentic . his comment was in response to a 7 december 2015 proposal by then - presidential candidate donald trump to institute a temporary ban on muslims entering the country until government officials could “ figure out what ’ s going on .” <PARA> after trump nominated pence as his gop running - mate in july 2016 , pence backtracked on the issue . when asked in october 2016 why he had stopped condemning the idea of a ban , pence said he no longer needed to condemn it because trump had supposedly abandoned the position himself . <PARA> the most significant difference between the ban instituted by trump ’ s january 2017 executive order and the one he proposed as a candidate in 2015 is its scope . the earlier proposal called for “ a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states ,” while the executive order targets residents of seven specific muslim majority nations .	
unproven	in late january 2017 , news outlets across the united states reported on a purported “ can you hear me ?” telephone scam . according to those reports , the scam begins with an unsolicited phone call to the putative mark . after the caller makes contact they ask the recipient “ can you hear me ?” to elicit a response of “ yes ,” and a potential onslaught of unauthorized charges ensues . <PARA> on 26 january 2017 , cbs news reported the workings of the scam thusly : <PARA> at first glance , the warning sounded reasonably valid : major news outlets covered it , and a better business bureau satellite office reported the scam as well . but a closer examination revealed some questionable elements . <PARA> primarily , we haven ’ t yet been able to identify any scenario under which a scammer could authorize charges in another person ’ s name simply by possessing a voice recording of that person saying “ yes ,” without also already possessing a good deal of personal and account information for that person , and without being able to reproduce any other form of verbal response from that person . <PARA> moreover , even if such a scenario existed , it ’ s hard to imagine why scammers would need to utilize an actual audio recording of the victim ’ s repeating the word “ yes ” rather than simply providing that response themselves . as far as we know , phone companies , utilities , and credit card issuers don ’ t maintain databases of voice recordings of their customers and use them to perform real - time audio matching to verify identities during customer service calls . <PARA> in all the news reports we found , interviewees merely reported having been asked the common question (“ can you hear me ?”) but did not aver that they themselves had fallen prey to scammers : <PARA> bbb of western pennsylvania warned of the scam on 18 october 2016 but described no specific instances of individuals being scammed . that bbb satellite referenced the organization ’ s nationwide scam tracker , but all related entries we found there were submitted by people already aware of news reports about the purported scam : <PARA> a cbs news report on the purported “ can you hear me ?” had prompted police warnings in 2016 , but yet again we found no indication that anyone who had actually been scammed out of money by saying “ yes ” to a caller had stepped forward . ( it ’ s not uncommon for police departments to spread dubious crime warnings on a “ better safe than sorry ” basis , such as one about a $ 100 bill carjacking ploy .) <PARA> the “ can you hear me ?” scam for now seems to be more a suggestion of a hypothetical crime scheme than a real one that is actually robbing victims of money . in messages we left with the bbb , the ftc , and the consumer federation of america , we asked a question absent from all the news reports we ’ ve encountered about this scam : “ are there any documented cases of people being victimized in this manner ?” we have not yet received any affirmative response to those queries .	
false	on 24 january 2017 , the facebook page “ live action ” published a video purportedly showing “ prenatal care deception ” at planned parenthood , which has approximately 650 health centers operated by 57 affiliates across the u . s . the gist of the video ’ s presentation was that planned parenthood lies about providing reproductive and health services such as prenatal care , instead focusing solely on providing abortions : <PARA> this video quotes snippets of richards ’ saying : “ prenatal care . these are the kinds of services that folks depend on planned parenthood for ,” and “ a president who will fight for pre - natal care !” we could not find the specific origins of the first snippet , but it ’ s clear that richards was listing several services that planned parenthood provides ( and not claiming they offer only or primarily prenatal care ), as she said “ these are the kinds of services that folks depend on planned parenthood for . but live action apparently omitted the first portion of her statement . <PARA> the second snippet came from a 2016 speech in which richards endorsed hillary clinton for president . the portion of the speech included in the live action video was less about what services planned parenthood offers and more about what qualities the organization was looking for in a u . s . president : <PARA> the video also used a quote from lori lamerand , the ceo of planned parenthood of mid and south michigan , to make it seem as if the organization were unjustly touting their prenatal care services . according to the video , lamerand said : “ prenatal care ! um — and that — that is what we want to focus on . that is what is so vital .” <PARA> but again , this quote was taken out of context from a speech lamerand gave during the pink bus tour in 2011 , and according to planned parenthood , lamerand “ spoke about the vital services like birth control , pap smears , and preventative cancer screenings , which planned parenthood provides to women who otherwise might go without .” <PARA> the context of these quotes is important since live action shared this video with the title “ the prenatal care deception .” in order to set up the “ deception ,” live action needed to try to establish that planned parenthood supposedly unjustly bragged about the prominence of their prenatal care services before offering supposed audio recordings of calls with planned parenthood representatives who stated that the organization did not in fact provide these services . <PARA> although planned parenthood does provide prenatal care services , those services are not a primary part of their operation . according to organization ’ s annual report for 2014 - 2015 , they only provided 17 , 419 instances of prenatal care services ( compared to 3 , 533 , 522 std tests and 323 , 999 abortions .) live action offered no evidence that planned parenthood lied about these numbers , or that planned parenthood claimed they provide prenatal care services at all of their health centers . <PARA> not only did live action present planned parenthood ’ s comments without proper context , their investigation also presented a misleading picture about the services provided by the organization . we can ’ t verify if every one of the phone call recordings offered in the above - displayed video was genuine , but we can say that the claim “ only 5 [ planned parenthood ] facilities out of 97 ” provide prenatal care is misleading at best . <PARA> first of all , planned parenthood operates more than 650 facilities in the united states . in california alone , we found 13 planned parenthood clinics that advertise prenatal services . planned parenthood hudson peconic ( pphp ), which operates health centers in suffolk , westchester , and rockland counties , new york , provides prenatal care in 6 of their 10 health centers . <PARA> we also found that many of the planned parenthood clinics that do not provide prenatal care services do nonetheless state they offer resources to assist those in need of finding such care : “ if you choose to continue a pregnancy , we will provide you with a list of resources to help you obtain prenatal care .” <PARA> ( we also surveyed several planned parenthood offices ourselves . for example , we called the family first health center in fresno , california , who confirmed to us that they do in fact offer prenatal care services . we also contacted the planned parenthood office in tempe , arizona ( one of the first locations mentioned in the video ), who told us that they did not provide prenatal care services themselves but directed us to a nearby facility , the mountain park health center , that does .) <PARA> the live action video is based on the implication that planned parenthood claimed to provide prenatal care services at all of their facilities , or that the organization was misleading the public about how often it provides these services . however , that simply isn ’ t the case : <PARA> it should be noted that the organization ’ s web site states that “ planned parenthood health centers focus on prevention : 80 percent of our patients receive services to prevent unintended pregnancy ,” and that live action chose to compare prenatal services ( approximately 17 , 000 in 2014 - 2015 ) to abortions ( more than 300 , 000 ) for this video , which gave the misleading impression that planned parenthood rarely provides reproductive health services other than abortions . in reality , planned parenthood provides more std screenings ( 4 , 218 , 149 ), contraception services ( 2 , 945 , 059 ), and cancer screenings ( 682 , 208 ) than they do abortions .	
unproven	on 23 january 2017 , fox business correspondent charlie gasparino posted on facebook that he saw chief white house adviser kellyanne conway break up a fight between two men by personally intervening and landing several “ mean punches .” <PARA> gasparino claims he was with his friend , actor scott baio , at an inauguration ball when he saw two men fighting until conway intervened and ended it with her fists . <PARA> we have reached out to gasparino on social media for more details but haven ’ t heard back , nor have we received a response from trump spokeswoman hope hicks . we inquired with local law enforcement , but neither d . c . metropolitan police nor the secret service said they were aware of a fight involving conway at an inaugural ball .	
false	on 8 january 2017 , the entertainment web site article 107 news published an article reported that president obama had promoted controversial former taliban captive bowe bergdahl of the u . s . army to the rank of staff sergeant : <PARA> there was no truth to this story , which originated with article 107 news , a “ satire ” publication that uses the tagline “ the facts before they happen ” and notes in their disclaimer that : <PARA> although article 107 news is a satirical web site , they were correct in their speculation that president obama would not grant bergdahl a pardon . on 20 january 2017 , bergdahl ’ s lawyer confirmed that the outgoing president had not issued such a pardon .	
false	on 23 january 2017 , the web site addicting info published an article reporting that the news trump administration had dismantled the white house call - in line in order to “ ban the public ” from calling to offer comment or protest : <PARA> while it ’ s true that the white house call - in comment line was inactive as of january 2017 ( we called the number and were informed by an automated voice message that the comment line was closed ), it ’ s inaccurate to say that the trump administration “ banned ” the public from calling the white house or “ dismantled ” the white house switchboard . <PARA> when donald trump was sworn in as the new president of the united states on 20 january 2017 , both a peaceful transition of power and a digital transition of assets took place . for instance , the majority of content on whitehouse . gov was removed and archived at obamawhitehouse . archive . gov in order to give the trump administration the opportunity to populate the government web site with their own content . similar changes were made with the <USER> twitter account . <PARA> in this case , the white house comment line was shut down nearly a week before president trump took office . on 14 january 2017 , the washington times reported that the obama administration had closed down the phone - in comment line : <PARA> the recorded message advised callers to send comments for the white house via facebook messenger . although president obama ’ s white house facebook account had messenger installed , as of the moment president trump ’ s does not : <PARA> while one could argue that president trump ’ s administration was slow to pick up the digital reins in the days immediately following his inauguration , it ’ s incorrect to say that he “ dismantled ” the white house call - in line . it ’ s more accurate to say that the white house call - in comment line was closed at the end of president obama ’ s term , and the trump administration did not reinstate it in the first few days of his presidency .

true	the gist of this account about maps ( and other items useful for escape efforts ) being smuggled to allied pows during world war ii by cleverly hiding them in monopoly game sets is true , although some of the finer details in this particular account may be inaccurate . <PARA> the general outline of the scheme to smuggle escape aids to pows through specially manufactured monopoly kits is recounted ( among other places ) in the game makers , a 2004 history of the parker brothers game company : <PARA> regardless of when it may have been officially declassified , information about the rigged monopoly kits was openly acknowledged and discussed long before 2007 . a 1985 associated press article , for example , reported that : <PARA> although the account claims “ an estimated one - third [ of escaped pows ] were aided in their flight by the rigged monopoly sets ,” both the game makers excerpt quoted above and waddington ’ s chairman said the number of pows who were actually aided by the smuggled game kits is unknown : <PARA> a former archivist with john waddington also pointed out some discrepancies in the account in response to a 2007 london times recounting of it :	
mixture	on 16 january 2017 , fox news reported that the clinton global initiative ( cgi ), an offshoot of the clinton foundation charitable organization , was downsizing : <PARA> the news left some readers with the mistaken impression the entire clinton foundation was shuttering its doors . however , as former president bill clinton announced in a 22 august 2016 letter , only the clinton global initiative wing , and not the entire foundation , would be downsizing operations : <PARA> brian cookstra , spokesman for the clinton foundation , told us that while cgi is indeed downsizing , some staff will remain on board “ to work on ongoing commitments that are helping millions of people worldwide .” cookstra said the annual meetings are ending and staff has been let go , but cgi university , a meeting that brings college students together , will continue . <PARA> the cgi , intended to find “ bold new ways to address global challenges ,” is only one of several initiatives that have operated under the clinton foundation umbrella ( including the clinton health access initiative , the clinton climate initiative , the clinton development initiative , the clinton giustra sustainable growth initiative , the clinton health matters initiative ). the cgi is not the same thing as the foundation itself , as cnn noted in an explainer article : <PARA> of course , it ’ s possible that the winding down of the cgi is just a precursor of factors ( e . g ., unfavorable publicity , declining donations , the presumably permanent retirement of mrs . clinton from the political arena ) that will lead to a major scaling down — or possibly the end — the clinton foundation itself , but for the moment the foundation itself is still a going concern .	
false	on 19 january 2017 the palmer report ( formerly daily news bin ) claimed president - elect donald trump had visited an auction house in order to specifically stage a “ fake ” photograph at a random receptionist ’ s desk , depicting himself penning his inaugural address : <PARA> referenced by the item was an 18 january 2017 image tweeted by trump : <PARA> asserting that the image depicted “ a gaudy golden wall with a distinctive design pattern ” evidencing the strange ruse , the palmer report article claimed : <PARA> the question of “ why ” was certainly compelling , as was the question of why the president - elect would undertake such a seemingly intricate ruse . the palmer report piece linked to a palm beach show group instagram photograph . that instagram posting did not specify when or where the picture was taken , but it included “# winterwhitehouse ,” “# inauguraladdress ,” “# receptionistdesk ,” and “# maralago ” among several hashtags . we contacted the palm beach show group and spoke with the individual in charge of their instagram account to obtain more information . she explained that the photograph likely traced by “ internet sleuths ” that supposedly identified an auction house as the location of the trump picture was one posted in december 2015 : <PARA> that image ’ s impossible - to - miss caption suggested it was taken at trump ’ s mar - a - lago club and not inside any “ auction house ”: <PARA> according to the palm beach show group ’ s employee , that company ’ s ceo is a member of the mar - a - lago club , and he snapped the photograph during a december 2015 visit there in order to showcase tickets and other materials regularly provided by him to the club ’ s guests . the woman depicted in the picture is not an auction house employee and was working at mar - a - lago when the photo was taken .	
false	on 18 january 2017 at least two facebook pages shared a meme claiming that vanilla ice cream was originally a deep black color , but it offended white people so much that its hue was changed in 1912 : <PARA> one does not need to be a history buff or a culinary whiz to be skeptical of the claim ’ s veracity . anyone who has ever made vanilla dishes is probably aware that vanilla packs a lot of flavor into a relatively small bean and is rarely more visible than small dark specks in dishes such as crème brûlée . <PARA> early images of ice cream are easy to find . the oldest we could dig up is from 1876 : <PARA> one from the same era showed boys in london eating pale ice cream , and an 1899 shot of prohibitionist carry nation depicted her with a white vanilla cone as well : <PARA> photographs from 1900 , 1908 , and 1909 showed similarly pale ice cream . <PARA> we found dozens of photographs of black ice cream , with or without a black cone . the photographs shared a common thread : attribution to new york city ice cream shop morgenstern ’ s , and their “ coconut ash ” flavor : <PARA> we contacted a representative for morgenstern ’ s in 2017 , who told us that the image indeed showed its “ coconut ash ” flavor and confirmed that they also sold black cones . in 2018 , the new york city department of health issued a ban on usage of activated charcoal in foods . the flavor has since been removed from the menu . <PARA> so although the image of black ice cream was real , its backstory is not . vanilla ice cream is naturally off - white , and the meme has no basis in fact .	
false	in january 2017 , multiple web sites reported that a group called “ demand protest ” had placed several ads on backpage . com offering to pay people to protest against president - elect donald trump at his inauguration : <PARA> it is true that several ads were placed on backpage . com targeting readers in a variety of cities , apparently seeking “ operatives ” to protest against trump in exchange for financial remuneration : <PARA> it ’ s also true that the web site demandprotest . com exists , but there were several reasons to be suspicious about the site , the related backpage ads , and the attendant claim that demandprotest was offering to hire “ agitators ” and pay them $ 2 , 500 each to protest against trump . <PARA> it wasn ’ t immediately clear who was behind the site and ads . according to the demand protest ’ s “ about ” page , the organization is run by a group of strategists who all operate with “ absolute discretion ”: <PARA> the web site also claimed in january 2017 that the group had already organized 48 campaigns for seventeen different causes : <PARA> this would have been been quite a feat , as the web site demandprotest . com was no more than a month old at the time . according to the domain ’ s registrar , demandprotest . com wasn ’ t registered until 2 december 2016 . <PARA> the web site also promised to use “ absolute discretion ” so as to not raise suspicions about their engaging paid protesters at events . however , the group allegedly posted dozens of ads on the publicly accessible backpage . com in an attempt to recruit people to protest at donald trump ’ s inauguration — the very opposite of “ discretion .” so one might conclude that either demand protest is very bad at their job , or they had an ulterior motive for publicly linking themselves to obviously controversial advertisements . <PARA> this web site also stated it was copyrighted by “ demand protest , llc ” and provided a contact number based in san francisco , yet we found no companies registered under that name in california . <PARA> fox news host tucker carlson confronted “ dom tullipso ,” the purported owner of the demand protest web site , on 17 january 2017 and called his company a sham . while “ tullipso ” ( carlson asserted that the man could not properly identify himself ) did not admit that the web site was a hoax , he did appear to be plainly joking throughout the interview . “ tullipso ” also spent little time attempting to verify his own web site in favor of attacking the legitimacy of fox news : <PARA> shortly after that interview aired , the washington times — one of the first news outlets to report on demand protest ’ s backpage ads recruiting anti - trump protesters ( and suggest they might be legitimate ) — changed their reporting to declare the web site a hoax : <PARA> during the 2016 presidential campaign , rumors were rampant about paid protesters being bussed into cities to disrupt trump rallies , yet we found none of those claims to be credible . craigslist . com ads were also posted in november 2016 in a seeming attempt to recruit paid protesters , but again we found evidence they were anything other than hoaxes . <PARA> anyone can post an ad to craigslist and backpage for free ( or a minimal fee ). the existence of “ paid protester ” ads on one of these sites does not in itself document that anyone is actually attempting to hire protesters for a fee .	
false	on 11 january 2017 , a facebook post shared on a page dedicated to conspiracy theorist alex jones claimed that famous rapper snoop dogg had “ threatened ” any black artist who dared to perform at the 20 january 2017 inauguration of donald trump . the post , created by david kirkland , accompanied an instagram video by snoop dogg with the following caption : <PARA> snoop , a prolific instagram user , did make a video where he “ threatened ” to roast any black perform who took the stage at donald trump ’ s inauguration . while the facebook post implied that nomenclature constituted a serious threat of harm , “ roast ” just meant snoop would make fun of them : <PARA> snoop may have “ threatened ” to make fun of black artists who performed for trump , but he clearly did not mean to imply a physical threat ( and people can be heard laughing in the background as he recorded his “ threat ”). the facebook post by kirkland seemed to be playing off snoop dogg ’ s tough , streetwise persona to give viewers the false impression that he was threatening to do harm beyond bruising someone ’ s ego .	
true	in mid - january 2017 , numerous news outlets reported on a department of defense solicitation for research proposals for the development of “ biodegradable training ammunition loaded with specialized seeds to grow environmentally beneficial plants that eliminate ammunition debris and contaminants ”. the grant was announced through the dod ’ s small business innovation research ( sbir ) program and posted publicly on 30 november 2016 . <PARA> this grant stems from legislation requiring federal agencies to reserve a fraction of their research funding for small businesses , as described on the program ’ s website : <PARA> in the solicitation for the proposal , the dod states that the requirements apply only to training rounds and not ammunition used in actual combat . they argue that the frequent use of training rounds been an environmental problem for the army : <PARA> though the dod has not stated specifics , there are a number of methods by which plants can remove toxins from the ground ( a collection of processes known as phytoremediation ). the dod solicitation closes on 8 february 2017 .	
false	in september 2016 , social media users began circulating links to a web site ( boughtmilk . com ) and asserting that anyone who had purchased milk after the year 2003 was eligible to participate in a class action lawsuit . as reported at the time , a settlement had been reached in an anti - trust class - action suit accusing dairy producers of artificially boosting milk prices : <PARA> in january 2017 , news reports about the milk class action settlement appeared regularly because the deadline for affected consumers to request a share of that settlement was set at 31 january 2017 . however , many social media users only saw headlines and brief descriptions which did not typically contain the specifics of the settlement or its restrictions . <PARA> boughtmilk . com was the “ official website for the fresh milk products price - fixing class action lawsuit ,” and a hub for filing claims and obtaining more information . according to that site , settlement eligibility applies only to consumers in 15 states and the district of columbia : <PARA> a question - and - answer section additionally explained that eligible class members living in those states must have purchased milk products since 2003 : <PARA> according to boughtmilk . com , eligible individuals could receive between $ 45 to $ 70 from a settlement pool of $ 52 million . the claim period began on 2 september 2016 , and the final deadline for filing passed on 31 january 2017 .	
false	on 9 january 2017 , the web site times . com . mx published an article reporting that mexican drug kingpin joaquín “ el chapo ” guzmán had donated millions of dollars to the clinton foundation , claiming that wikileaks founder julian assange had broken the news while speaking at a “ conference over the weekend ”: <PARA> this article was published on 9 january 2017 , and while the author claimed that assange made the comment at a “ conference ” over the weekend ( referring to the 7th and 8th of january ), the included photograph was actually taken in february 2016 , when the wikileaks founder appeared via a video stream for a news conference in which he discussed his possible extradition to sweden over a sexual assault charge , not improper donations from el chapo to the clinton foundation . <PARA> as well , times . com . mx suggested that assange made his comment in a room full of reporters , yet no legitimate news reports or video clips have surfaced confirming that assange made any such statment . furthermore , times . com . mx did not provide any links to back up their sources or any specific details ( such as the time and place of this “ conference ”) which could give their report credibility . <PARA> while times . com . mx does not carry a readily available disclaimer labeling its contents as fiction , this story of theirs is clearly just more fake news .	
false	a “ call - to - action ” message that urged television viewers to watch anything other than donald trump ’ s inauguration on 20 january 2017 in an attempt to lower the event ’ s tv ratings ( and thus strike a blow to the president - elect ’ s ego ) was widely circulated on facebook : <PARA> however , a boycott scheme similar to the described above would likely not be very effective regardless if whether viewers had their televisions turned on , off , or changed to something other than inauguration day news coverage . <PARA> the largest stumbling block to this plan is the assumption that each individual ’ s personal viewership affects a given television program ’ s ratings . this simply isn ’ t the case — unless , of course , that individual is a member of a “ nielsen family .” <PARA> the nielsen company gathers data to determine the ratings of television programs , and while the company employs a variety of methods to collect their data ( especially in this relatively new age of internet streaming ), the most common method is via nielsen families : <PARA> nielsen households are randomly selected as a representative sample of the tv - viewing population of the united states : <PARA> since nielsen uses these selected families to determine television ratings , the viewing habits of most people ( who are not members of a nielsen family ) go largely unrecorded . <PARA> vulture reporter margaret lyons addressed this issue in a 2015 q & a : <PARA> as of august 2016 , there were about 40 , 000 nielsen households , representing a total of 118 . 4 million tv - viewing households , in the united states . steve krakauer added more detail about how nielsen ratings were determined in a 2015 post on autonomous : <PARA> although nielsen isn ’ t the only company that compiles tv ratings , they are the company that has the most influence over the purchase of television advertisements : <PARA> it should also be noted that the way consumers watch television , and the way that nielsen collects is data , has changed in recent years . for instance , the company inked a deal with dish network in april 2016 to incorporate dish ’ s set - top boxes into its data . however , this deal was primarily focused on enhancing nielsen ’ s data from small , local markets : <PARA> as nielsen ’ s data is largely drawn from “ nielsen families ,” a non - nielsen family member ’ s individual viewing ( or lack thereof ) of donald trump ’ s inauguration would have virtually no impact on the event ’ s overall television ratings .	
unproven	among the topics covered by president - elect donald trump at his first formal press conference on 11 january 2017 was a plan to avoid any conflict of interest between his duties as president and his role as the owner of a multi - billion - dollar business by turning the management of his companies over to his sons , eric and donald . <PARA> to that end , trump invited an attorney , sherri dillon , to the podium and gestured at a nearby table stacked high with file folders , saying , “ these papers are just some of the many documents that i ’ ve signed turning over complete and total control to my sons ”: <PARA> despite their being so prominently displayed , however , reporters were not allowed to touch or examine the documents . according to cnn : <PARA> many on social media pointed out that the displayed folders and documents appeared to be untouched , unlabeled , and , in some cases , empty . filmmaker amy berg even claimed , based on her own experience , that the paper documents in some of the folders , to the extent they were visible , were blank : <PARA> the independent , a british online newspaper , made the same observation : <PARA> the left - leaning bipartisanreport . com took the allegation one step further and declared the documents “ fake ”: <PARA> in the end , however , all the chatter about “ empty files ” and “ blank ” or “ fake ” documents is mostly speculative . as we noted above , what gave rise to the suspicions in the first place was the fact that none of the reporters in the room was allowed to examine the file folders and documents . if no one examined them , we can ’ t corroborate what was or was not in them . <PARA> it ’ s certainly possible that the mounds of paperwork displayed during the press conference were blank and just for show , but there is not enough evidence to prove it . <PARA> on 12 january 2017 , associated press reported making a follow - up query about the paperwork , which the trump transition team again described as documents pertaining to the transfer of the businesses to his sons :	
false	on 6 january 2017 , the web site the rightists published an article reporting that hollywood was going on strike until donald trump resigned from the presidency . <PARA> the rightists bills itself as a “ hybrid ” web site that publishes articles containing a mixture of fact and fiction . in this case , the article started off with a paragraph concerning a one - page ad published in the new york times by the group “ refuse facism ,” which was reportedly supported by celebrities such as rosie o ’ donnell , debra messing , and ed asner : <PARA> the bulk of the rightists article , however , was made up of fictional quotes from a non - existent spokesperson . the following paragraphs , for instance , are complete fabrications : <PARA> the above - displayed passage was not published in an article by the new york times , did not appear in any other credible publication , and were not spoken by a spokesperson for “ refuse facism .” they originated on a web site that publishes articles consisting of a “ hybrid ” of fact and fiction : <PARA> refuse facism has been endorsed by several celebrities , and the group has organized protests , but the quotes published by the rightists stating that hollywood was going on strike until trump resigned are pure fiction .	
false	on 8 january 2017 a facebook user shared tan image of senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts , attributing to her the following bizarre quote : “ if women need to be raped by muslims to prove our tolerance , so be it — then thank goodness for planned parenthood .” <PARA> the poster commented in the original that “ she really did say this !” however , neither he nor any other commenter managed to locate a source for the credulity - begging remarks . predictably , we also found absolutely no trace of comments made by senator warren that matched ( or even paraphrased ) the words attributed to her above . no other sources latched on to what would be a highly newsworthy statement , and social networks other than facebook appear to be largely free of the same claim . <PARA> it appears the quote was fabricated from thin air , as we were unable to locate even a satirical article in which the “ rape ” comments were attributed to elizabeth warren .	
true	in november 2016 , a clip from an episode of the 1950s western television series trackdown was published to youtube , along with the claim that it “ predicted donald trump ” by featuring a snake oil salesman character named “ trump ” who claimed that only he could prevent the end of the world ... by building a wall around the town : <PARA> the television series trackdown really did produce an episode featuring a “ trump ” character who came to town claiming that only he could prevent the end of the world by building a wall ( and also sold special force propelling umbrellas to deflect meteorites ). the episode ( s1 , e30 ) aired on cbs in 1958 and was titled “ the end of the world ,” featuring actor lawrence dobkin playing the role of “ walter trump .” a synopsis of the episode from the classic tv archive reads as follows : <PARA> while dobkin appeared in at least three other episodes of trackdown , this was the only occasion in which he portrayed the walter trump character <PARA> a relevant portion of dialog from this episode has been transcribed below : <PARA> a representative for metv , a chicago network that airs reruns of trackdown , confirmed that the episode was real . the rep said that the after hoby tells walter trump that he is under arrest , the character gets shot by another character and may have been killed : <PARA> a full version of the episode was uploaded to youtube on 14 january 2017 :	
false	on 15 december 2014 , the world news daily report web site published an article titled “‘ little old lady ’ arrested for making fur coats with neighbor ’ s cats ” that told the story of an unnamed 85 - year - old female resident of waco , texas , being arrested and charged with unspecified crimes after police learned of her cruella de vil - like activities : <PARA> the claim was upsetting to many social media users , but thankfully for cat fanciers , there was nothing to it . world news daily report is one of many fake news outlets that fabricates outrageous stories in the hopes facebook users will pass the tales on to friends . <PARA> a reverse image search of the photograph appended to the article reveals it to have been lifted from a 2013 news story about the arrest of a 79 - year - old georgia woman named norma cheren on drug charges unrelated to cats .	
false	on 6 january 2017 , just a few hours after multiple people were killed by a gunman at florida ’ s fort lauderdale - hollywood airport , disreputable web site the gateway pundit published an article claiming that cnn altered a photograph of esteban santiago , the alleged shooter , to make his skin appear lighter : <PARA> the gateway pundit did not provide any evidence that this altered photograph appeared on cnn ; no video clips were included , nor were there any screenshots showing that this image aired on cnn . similar claims made by the “ trump mafia ” youtube page and writers for various conspiracy web sites were also short on evidence : <PARA> cnn has published several videos about the incident , yet we found no record of either photograph airing on the network . we have also seen no credible reports that this aired live on television . a report from the daily beast also found that these images never appeared on cnn . <PARA> furthermore , the man pictured in this photograph is not the same esteban santiago connected to the florida shooting , but rather a different man with the same name who was registered as a sex offender in florida . cbs news published photographs of the actual accused shooter , which clearly showed a different ( and much younger ) man , who is also named esteban santiago : <PARA> we were also unable to find any evidence that cbs ( or anyone else ) had lightened the actual suspect ’ s skin in the photograph displayed here .	
false	an image featuring a photograph of “ gilligan ’ s island ” actor bob denver along with an announcement about his death was widely circulated on social media in january 2017 : <PARA> it ’ s unclear why social media users mistakenly shared a meme stating that bob denver passed away in 2017 . one possible explanation is that someone shared a story about denver on the anniversary of his birth ( which was 9 january 1935 ) but added in a message about the actor ’ s death , which then was confused by readers with an announcement of his death . <PARA> social media users also mourned the death of bob denver in january 2016 .	
true	a disturbing video that has gone viral and apparently shows a young girl hanging herself has turned into a criminal investigation by police . while we made numerous unsuccessful attempts to reach polk county police in an effort to verify the video , chief kenny dodd told local reporters the video is authentic . dodd told fox5 : <PARA> in an online blog linked to davis , she talks about depression but also about being physically and psychologically abused by a male family member who she says attempted to rape her . <PARA> the polk county standard journal reported davis ’ body was found on 30 december 2016 with “ self - inflicted wounds ” outside her home . she was taken to a nearby hospital , where emergency department staff were unable to revive her . an obituary for the girl says she is survived by her parents , sister and brother . a funeral service will be held on 6 january 2017 . <PARA> in the video connected to the incident , davis could be seen setting up a camera , then making a noose and tying it to a tree before tearfully apologizing to a number of people and talking about feeling inadequate and unable to deal with depression . the video ( which has since been removed from youtube ) appeared to show her hanging for a number of hours as the sunlight faded . it is unclear how many people were watching her stream , and whether any of them called for help . <PARA> polk county police det . kristen hearn told the standard journal that investigators were working on obtaining search warrants for davis ’ phone , facebook account and a third , unnamed social media site . <PARA> national suicide prevention lifeline : 1 - 800 - 273 - 8255	
false	a photograph circulating on facebook in early 2017 sought help finding a missing boy who had reportedly gone missing from his pennsylvania home after abduction . although the appeal was a somewhat fact - based one , the child has long since been found and safely returned to his home . <PARA> harrisburg television station whp reported on 30 december 2016 that the boy seen in the photograph is actually 7 - year - old ariel revello , noting that “ he is not from harrisburg and , most importantly , he is not missing .” <PARA> ariel revello is actually from connecticut and was the subject of an amber alert issued on 12 march 2016 , when his father rodolfo revello allegedly took him ( along with thousands of dollars in cash ) after attacking ariel ’ s mother . <PARA> the boy was found later the same day at a relative ’ s home after his father contacted police . rodolfo revello was arrested twelve days later in new york city and charged with assault and kidnapping .	
false	a popular pop culture superstition holds that a white bic disposable lighter is bad luck . while there are many reasons why people believe this , the most commonly offered reason is that several members of the “ 27 club ” ( musicians who all passed away at the age of 27 ) — including kurt cobain , jimi hendrix , janis joplin , and jim morrison — all allegedly had this product in their pockets when they died . <PARA> this rumor was summed up in a 2013 post on high ideas as follows : <PARA> we ’ re skeptical of the notion that an inanimate object can by itself bring good or bad fortune to its bearer , so this article will be limited to examining whether hendrix , morrison , joplin , and cobain were all carrying white cigarette lighters at the time of their deaths : <PARA> the first disposable lighters <PARA> the biggest knock on this theory is that the white disposable bic lighter simply didn ’ t exist when hendrix , morrison , or joplin died . the first disposable bic lighter wasn ’ t produced until 1973 , more than a year after morrison ’ s 3 july 1971 death , and hendrix and joplin had both passed away even earlier , in 1970 . <PARA> while it simply isn ’ t possible for morrison , hendrix , or joplin to have been in possession of a white bic lighter at the time of their deaths , they could have been carrying some other brand of disposable lighter , such as the cricket : <PARA> however , this is also unlikely . the cricket was available in the 1960s in france , but it wasn ’ t commonly found in the united states until after the brand was acquired by gillette and introduced to american customers in 1972 , well after the deaths of hendrix and joplin . ( jim morrison had been living in france just prior to his death and expired in his paris apartment , so he quite possibly could have encounter cricket lighters prior to their introduction to the american marketplace .) <PARA> furthermore , we looked through several biographies and obituaries offering the circumstances of the passings of joplin , hendrix , and morrison , and found no mention of lighters being in their possession at the time of their deaths . in fact , mention of white lighters seems to appear only in articles that propagate the rumor . <PARA> kurt cobain <PARA> of the four musicians frequently associated with this rumor , only kurt cobain could unquestionably have been carrying a white bic lighter at the time of his death ( since he committed suicide in 1994 , long after bics had gained prominence in the united states ). <PARA> according to a set of photographs released by the seattle police department in 2014 , cobain had two lighters in close proximity to him on the day of his death . however , neither of those lighters was in his pocket , and neither was white . one multi - colored lighter was discovered in his heroin kit , and another lighter that appears distinctly pink in photographs was found nearby : <PARA> the official los angeles medical examiner - coroner ’ s autopsy report for janis joplin is available online and makes no mention of any cigarette lighter ( of any brand , color , or type ) having been found on or around her body . <PARA> jim morrison died in the bathtub of his paris apartment and therefore couldn ’ t have had any lighter on his person when he expired ( since he was not in the habit of bathing fully clothed ). also , morrison was determined to have died of “ heart failure ,” so french authorities deemed an autopsy unnecessary and did not perform one . therefore , no autopsy report ever existed to document the presence of a lighter found near his body or in his clothing , as claimed . <PARA> jimi hendrix ’ s death certificate ( listing his cause of death as “ inhalation of vomit ” and “ barbiturate intoxication ”) is available online , but we could not locate a full copy of his autopsy report . nonetheless , we found no secondary references to that report indicating it included any mention of a ( white ) cigarette lighter on or about hendrix ’ s body . <PARA> in short , there ’ s extremely little chance , and zero evidence documenting , that any of the four musicians mentioned above had white disposable lighters in their pockets at the time they breathed their last .	
false	on 29 december 2016 , politicalo published an article that appeared to report bristol palin said “ sissies ” who won ’ t perform at president - elect donald trump ’ s inauguration did not want to because they were afraid they might fall in love with him : <PARA> the material published by politicalo ( as well as sister sites religionlo , politicops , and newslo ) generally begins with a paragraph of fact - based information before appending extensive fabricated details . <PARA> it has been widely reported that palin described artists refusing to accept invitations to trump ’ s 20 january 2017 inauguration as “ sissies ”: <PARA> but all content following the first paragraph ’ s “ sissies ” remark was fabricated . palin ’ s remarks did not delve into whether trump was irresistible or lovable , nor did she suggest at any point that anyone would be uncontrollably attracted to him . <PARA> newslo ‘ s fake news sites frequently circulate ( sometimes using the lesser - known politicops domain ) on social media , and all include a button allowing readers to “ show facts ” or “ hide facts .” <PARA> the sites ’ articles display by default in “ hide facts ” mode , ensuring most visitors are not apprised of the highlighted embellishments : <PARA> bristol palin , and the rest of the palin family , are a popular target for newslo sites . previous articles falsely reported that bristol palin said all black actors look alike and thus are unlikely to earn oscar nods , and another stated ( again , falsely ) that sarah palin made offensive remarks about slavery .	
false	on 21 december 2016 , several questionable articles appeared , all of which reported that a “ china chow ” restaurant in coral springs , florida was shut down by authorities after it was discovered the restaurant was serving dog meat : <PARA> the claim was yet another version of an age - old urban legend holding that chinese restaurants regularly serve foods that are unpalatable or taboo to westerners , rumors that have been in circulation for more than a century . as repeatedly noted in deconstructions of this perennial myth , it serves as a socially acceptable manner by which to voice doubt about the trustworthiness of unfamiliar or exotic cultures : <PARA> another common element of urban legends about the wealthy is their appetite for immoral , decadent , or horrifying pursuits ( presumably having exhausted entertainment avenues open to the masses ). the claim touched on that idea with the suggestion that “ vips ” primarily sought out a menu of housepets in their chinese food ordering habits . <PARA> one indicator that the story was not credible was that its image was published to the web as early as 2013 , and was not associated with a december 2016 incident involving china chow in coral springs . a larger second clue came from a since - deleted facebook post published by the official coral springs police page : <PARA> as coral springs police noted , several elements of the story proved questionable , and the local law enforcement agency itself labeled the claim “ fake news ” and not an ongoing investigation . no credible outlet reported the claim , and its status as a very old urban legend further indicated it was no more than a tired hoax .	
false	in late december 2016 , a screenshot ( reproduced above ) began circulating on facebook , urging dog owners not to give walmart holiday rawhide chews to their pets . the warning circulated in screenshot form and appeared to originate with a local buy and sell facebook group for salem , oregon . <PARA> the misspelled post read as follows : <PARA> according to the unnamed facebook poster , their household ’ s two dogs received holiday rawhide bones from walmart as gifts on 25 december 2016 and subsequently fell ill . on 26 or 27 december 2016 , the user stated that they visited a local veterinarian , and learned that the treats were “ laced ” with formaldehyde . <PARA> the post ’ s author said during a call to walmart , they were informed that at least six pet owners had called about the issue that day , that the product had been “ pulled ” from stock , and that guests were invited to complete insurance claim - related paperwork relating to the purportedly contaminated product . in addition , the poster claimed the manager confided that at least one pet had died as a result . <PARA> we contacted the abiqua animal clinic , walmart ’ s corporate offices , and the walmart closest to the post ’ s location and veterinary clinic . the walmart manager told us that there was no active recall involving walmart ’ s holiday rawhide bones , and while several people had called about the issue , the store was aware only of calls stemming from the facebook post — not pet owners filing insurance claim paperwork . <PARA> the manager told us that recalled products are frozen in walmart ’ s inventory system ( making purchase at checkout impossible ) and the holiday rawhide bones were available for purchase as of 28 december 2016 . <PARA> another walmart representative reiterated that no such recall or other action had been initiated involving any rawhide pet product sold by the chain . while the poster claimed multiple other pet owners endured the same experience , walmart was aware only of the claims made on facebook . walmart told us that it made contact with the customer , but that individual was not able to substantiate any portion of the claim .	
false	on 25 december 2016 , the unreliable political site yournewswire . com published an article asserting that president obama had signed a “ christmas bill ... quietly ” that effectively labeled alternative media as “ propaganda ” and criminalized it : <PARA> the original source cited in the above excerpt , wearechange . org , claimed that the legislation was timed to coincide with the distraction of christmas so as to escape public notice : <PARA> purposely or not , these sources have conflated and misrepresented two separate pieces of legislation . one , the intelligence authorization act for fiscal year 2017 ( h . r . 6393 , reintroduced as h . r . 6480 ), authorized funding for the federal intelligence services . the other , the national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) for fiscal year 2017 , authorized funding for the department of defense . while both contained provisions related to foreign propaganda , only one , the ndaa , was signed into law before christmas 2016 . it contained a section ( originally introduced as separate legislation called the counter disinformation and anti - propaganda act ) described by its bipartisan co - sponsors as follows : <PARA> note that according to its authors , the legislation was conceived not to clamp down on alternative news sources within the u . s ., but rather to protect the “ freedom of the marketplace of ideas on the international stage .” note also that as written into the ndaa , the legislation ’ s provisions establish an inter - agency body “ to track and evaluate counterfactual narratives abroad that threaten the national security interests of the united states and united states allies ,” and to develop “ procedures to expose and refute foreign misinformation and disinformation and proactively promote fact - based narratives and policies to audiences outside the united states .” <PARA> similarly , language in the intelligence authorization act ( passed by the house but not yet , as of this writing , passed by the senate or signed into law ) would establish an executive branch committee “ to counter active measures by the russian federation to exert covert influence over peoples and governments .” <PARA> so , while neither bill explicitly rules out targeting the spread of disinformation on the home front , the stated focus in both cases is on stemming its flow abroad . more to the point , the focus is on disinformation originating from foreign sources ( e . g ., russia and china ), not domestic ones . contrary to rumor , therefore , there is nothing in either bill , targeting or “ criminalizing ” practitioners of so - called “ alternative media ” or “ independent journalism ” within the united states . <PARA> as with any legislation , there is always the possibility that in practice its scope will extend , for good or ill , beyond the authors ’ original intentions ( and that circumstance can be cause for concern ), but there is nothing in the language itself that directly threatens the freedom of american journalists .	
false	some time in april 2016 , social media users began sharing a set of three photographs depicting oscar - winning actors meryl streep and morgan freeman and rap artist future , claiming that future looked like an amalgam of both streep and freeman . the meme apparently started as a twitter joke , but as such things tend to do , it passed seamlessly from internet joke to rumor . <PARA> the meme originated in 2015 , when social media users noticed that future and streep share certain facial features , including high cheekbones , strong noses and similar smiles . at that time , the iteration of the joke was that meryl streep and future were the same person : <PARA> the following year , people began adding morgan freeman into the mix : <PARA> since then , some have added pictures of other celebrities with similar bone structure , including “ house of cards ” actor mahershala ali and retired nba player scottie pippen . <PARA> according to available biographical information , future , whose real name is nayvadius demun wilburn , was born in 1983 and raised in atlanta , georgia . ( streep has been married to sculptor don gummer since 1978 , and articles about streep ’ s personal life generally characterize it as stable .) <PARA> we found no evidence to support the claim that streep is the biological mother of future due to an extra - marital affair with freeman . in fact , the meme seems to have started as a joke playing off similar facial features shared by the celebrities , and as memes do , caught on and circulated around the internet for the sole sake of social media users ’ amusement .	
false	the december 2016 conviction of charleston church shooter dylann roof led to the recirculation of related conspiracy theories and fake news , including an old report that roof had been raped in prison by fellow inmates : <PARA> although the item was appeared on the fake news web site nymeta in july 2015 ( not long after roof ’ s initial identification and arrest ), the outwardly undated piece was spread again after his december 2016 conviction led to his name again appearing in headlines . the storyline appealed to many social media users ’ desire for justice due to the gravity of roof ’ s crime and his targeting of peaceful black congregants . <PARA> however , items published by nymeta ( largely inactive in december 2016 ) were not meant to be taken seriously . before claiming roof was raped in prison , the site featured items asserting a morbidly obese woman gave birth to a 40 lb . baby , that facebook ’ s “ rainbow filter ” was a danger to users , and that kansas kindergarteners were exposed to ebola via a substitute teacher . <PARA> a disclaimer on the site reads : <PARA> in real news , roof was reportedly beaten , but not raped , by a black inmate while detained at the charleston county detention center in august 2016 .	
false	an image purportedly showing a tweet sent out by donald trump in which the president - elect confirmed that popular band nickelback had been secured to play at his inauguration was circulated on social media in december 2016 : <PARA> this was not a real tweet from donald trump . <PARA> this message does not currently appear in the timeline of the official donald trump twitter account , and it ’ s unlikely the tweet was deleted , as it was supposedly retweeted more than 21 , 000 times yet we were unable to find a single retweet redirecting back to the original . <PARA> furthermore , donald trump ’ s twitter feed has been a consistent source for news stories in 2016 and is closely monitored by journalists , so if the above - displayed message were real , it would have certainly been picked up by some legitimate news organizations . <PARA> the entertainment line - up for donald trump ’ s inauguration has been another subject of controversy in the weeks since the presidential election . numerous performers , such as elton john , were rumored for the gig but later denied they would play at the event . exaggerated reports also circulated claiming that all marching bands were boycotting the event . <PARA> on 21 december 2016 , the presidential inaugural committee unveiled the schedule of events for the week of trump ’ s inauguration , including a “ welcome concert ” on 19 january 2017 . while jackie evancho will sing the national anthem at the inauguration , other performers for the concert have not yet been announced .	
mixture	on 18 december 2016 , the federalist papers , a conservative clickbait web site , posted a story headlined “ hillary ’ s popular vote win came entirely from california ”: <PARA> as the web site pointed out , as of 19 december 2016 cnn had hillary clinton winning a popular vote margin over donald trump with totals of 65 , 788 , 583 to 62 , 955 , 363 respectively , a margin of approximately 2 . 8 million votes ( although trump won the presidency by securing 306 electoral college votes , 36 more than he needed to claim victory ). <PARA> it ’ s true that if california ’ s vote totals were entirely removed from the equation then hillary clinton would lose her popular vote lead , but the logic of that assessment is somewhat flawed . one could , for example , arbitrarily remove the states of new york and massachusetts from the vote count , docking clinton roughly 2 . 6 million votes ( and wiping out her popular vote win ). or one could similarly claim that trump ’ s electoral vote victory “ came entirely from texas ,” since if clinton had taken the lone star state ( and its 38 electoral votes ), she would also have won the overall election . one could combine any number of states ’ vote counts and exclude them from the aggregate , but doing so wouldn ’ t undo the basic mathematical principle that a vote difference in one state can ’ t sway the election results to or from a candidate who doesn ’ t also have significant support from multiple other states . in this case , california wouldn ’ t have put clinton over the top in the popular vote total without the additional 61 . 4 million votes she received in other states . <PARA> there is some validity to pointing out that the 2016 election is an exemplar of a modern trend that generally sees democratic candidates tending to receive large numbers of votes from densely - populated metropolitan areas in states such as new york and california , while republican candidates tend to collect votes from geographically larger but less populated portions of the country — one of the main factors behind this election ’ s disparity between the popular vote ( which clinton won ) and the electoral vote that actually decides the election ( which trump won ). this phenomenon could be viewed as a positive , that our electoral system requires winning presidential candidates to have broad national support and not just rack up huge margins in a relatively small number of high - population centers . on the other hand , some argue that our government should represent people and not geography , and therefore the location of voters should be irrelevant . <PARA> it may also be true , as donald trump has claimed , that without our winner - take - all electoral system ( under which it makes no difference whether a candidate loses a state by 100 votes or 10 , 000 , 000 votes ) that generally forces candidates to focus their efforts on a handful of “ swing ” states , he might have campaigned differently and garnered more popular votes than hillary clinton did . but freed from those electoral constraints , clinton might also have campaigned differently and won more popular votes than she actually did — all such imaginings are just speculation that cannot be proved one way or the other . <PARA> in any case , it is true that the margin of votes by which hillary clinton won the state of california was significantly greater than the margin by which she won the national popular vote . but even if clinton ’ s 4 . 3 million vote victory over trump in california provided her overall winning edge , it wouldn ’ t be an issue if she hadn ’ t also amassed enough votes all the other states to make that outcome possible .	
false	on 15 december 2016 , wikileaks founder julian assange appeared on sean hannity ’ s radio show . while the two discussed a wide variety of topics , at one point the fox news host steered the conversation toward “ document number 1078645 ,” an alleged e - mail published by wikileaks stating that several prominent republicans were on clinton ’ s payroll : <PARA> this document was never published by wikileaks . we found no record of a “ document number 1078645 ,” and searches for the text of the alleged e - mail also yielded no results . <PARA> the first mention of this purported document was published on 7 december 2016 by the disreputable web site thelastlineofdefense . org : <PARA> this “ e - mail ” was picked up by several other conservative web sites , including the conservative daily post , dcposts . com , and endingthefed . com , , and eventually was mentioned by hannity on his radio show . <PARA> despite its widespread reproduction , there is no truth to this rumor . the claim originated with a web site that has consistently published inaccurate information and features a disclaimer on thelastlineofdefense . org stating that all of its content should be considered fictional :	
false	the social security “ middle digit ” rumor is yet another big brother conspiracy theory , this one purporting that the federal government and its policies help promote racism . we ’ re told the fifth digit of social security numbers denotes race , thus identifying blacks and minorities to mortgage lenders , university admissions officers , employers , and others in application processes that should be color blind . armed with the foreknowledge of who is black and who is white , perhaps the resumes and applications of african americans are being shuffled to the bottom of the pile . <PARA> it ’ s a chilling thought because we know in our heart of hearts if an exploitable resource did exist for pegging sight unseen what color any of us was , there are bigots out there who would not hesitate to use it . thankfully , it doesn ’ t . the e - mailed warnings quoted above are bunk ; none of the digits in a social security number has anything to do with race . the only information ‘ hidden ’ in an ssn is where and when it was issued . <PARA> each ssn is composed of nine digits , commonly written as three fields separated by hyphens : aaa - gg - ssss . the first three - digit field is the area number and indicates what state was listed in the applicant ’ s mailing address when the number was issued . someone with a mailing address in oregon , for instance , would have a ssn beginning with 540 to 544 , while the ssn of someone with a mailing address in alabama would begin with 416 to 424 . <PARA> the second set of numbers ( a grouping of two , which includes the supposed infamous ‘ race ’ digit ) shows when the ssn was issued , not to whom . note that it does not directly correspond to the year of issue : a 42 in this field does not indicate this particular ssn was handed out in 1942 . different states go through this two - digit code at different rates . moreover , when a state is done with a particular group number , the next one it begins using comes off the line according to a numbering system which makes perfect sense to the government , but to no one else . ( even so , we ’ re going to attempt to explain it here .) <PARA> before 1965 , only half of the potential group numbers were used : odd numbers below ten and even numbers above nine . in 1965 , the system was changed so that assignments continued with the low even numbers and the high odd numbers . therefore , group numbers for each area number are exhausted in the following order : <PARA> the last four digits on an ssn are unique to the individual and are known as the series numbers . they are handed out in chronological order within each area and group number . simply put , if two people living in the same area apply for a ssn during the same year , the first five digits of both numbers will be identical . if their applications hit the desk at the ssa at the same time , there will be a one - number difference , say , 3456 vs . 3457 . <PARA> getting back to the ‘ race ’ digit possessed of a better understanding of how the ssa assigns that number , we find that prior to 1965 , a bushelful of ssns with even numbers in this position were generated ( 45 ) as compared to a mere handful of odd ( 5 ). the more densely populated the area , the greater the amount of group numbers exhausted , resulting in ssns in highly - populated areas more closely patterning themselves to the pre - 1965 nine - to - one optimal result for this field . in less populated areas , however , the discrepancy between odd and even is less noticeable , because the five odd numbers are used up first ( e . g ., if in alaska only twenty group numbers have been used up , then five are odd and fifteen even , resulting in a three - to - 1 ratio .) <PARA> from 1965 on , group numbers continue to be assigned on the above basis , but now with the second set of potential codes ( 49 only this time ; there is no 00 ) being called into service when the first fifty are used up . consequently , group codes have to achieve a ten - to - one even - to - odd imbalance before the numbers begin resetting themselves towards parity . <PARA> so how does this impact the rumor ? <PARA> at the wildest point of the numbering swing , the odds are 10 - to - 1 any given person ’ s ssn group code is an even number . therefore , the claim that “ i polled 35 african - americans , 34 had an even fifth digit in their ss #, the 35th person was white / puerto rican ,” isn ’ t all that surprising . especially when you consider that the five odd group numbers were handed out first , it ’ s almost a leadpipe cinch that the ssns of most of the people you meet will contain an even group code . <PARA> all of the foregoing can be summed up thusly : the first five digits of an ssn say nothing about who the number is assigned to — they merely reflect the state and year of issue . the last four digits are particular to the individual subscriber , but they ’ re handed out randomly , with the sole determining factor being when the paperwork is processed . other than his state of residence at the time of application , nothing about the ssn - holder ’ s identity is coded into the number assigned to him . <PARA> let ’ s face it , many of us don ’ t trust the government . any random tidbit that seems to confirm the rightness of that stance will be seized upon by those who already believe the worst of uncle sam . in this case , because social security numbers are constructed to conform with certain arcane and almost incomprehensible numbering schemes , it ’ s not that far of a stretch to conclude that some of the ‘ secret information ’ encoded into them could be used against us . we already harbor mistrust over being identified by a number , and the revelation that secret stuff is going on with how the numbers are handed out only serves to heighten that anxiety . <PARA> white , black , or green , no one likes being reduced to a number ; it smacks too much of governmental impersonalization , and its orwellian overtones disturb us . in the case of african - americans , this more general unease is further enhanced because of how their government treated them in the past , as patricia turner , a university of california - davis african - american and african studies professor noted in her book , i heard it through the grapevine : rumor in african - american culture :	
false	in december 2016 , two facebook pages shared a photograph of what appeared to be a salvation army bell ringer holding a sign that read , “ we help people , just not the gays ”: <PARA> one post was captioned that the sign was “ something to remember this holiday season ,” while another said “ just a friendly reminder that ‘ the gays ’ aren ’ t people . brought to you by your local salvation army .” <PARA> neither post included information about the photograph , such as its subject , the date on which it was taken , or any other details enabling readers to put the image in context . as a result , some people interpreted the photograph to be that of an actual salvation army volunteer announcing the organization ’ s views on its placard . <PARA> the image dated back to at least 2012 , as evidenced by a blog post and imgur page ; the latter linked to a reddit thread and captioned : “ next to a salvation army sign in union square , nyc .” all versions suggest that the photograph was taken in or before december 2012 , and early versions universally identified the man with the sign as a protester of the salvation army , not a volunteer . <PARA> later in 2012 , descriptions of the photograph shifted to assertions that the sign ’ s holder was not a protester and was actually a bell ringer : <PARA> the salvation army ’ s web site details a “ no discrimination ” policy for lgbt individuals . <PARA> although the origin of the image is still unknown , the scene it showed was originally presented as a protest and not a salvation army initiative . nevertheless , we contacted the organization for further information about the photograph but did not receive a reply .	
false	in december 2016 , footage appeared online purportedly showing a “ make - a - wish ” experience in which a sick child ’ s attempt to score a touchdown abruptly ended when he was brutally tackled . <PARA> while various versions of this footage were shared with titles claiming that it depicted a real incident , this video was actually a comedy sketch from jimmy tatro . <PARA> the video was originally shared on the youtube channel “ life according to jimmy ” on 12 december 2016 , and was accompanied by a full list of credits , clearly indicating that it was a scripted sketch and not genuine footage of a failed “ make - a - wish ” ( or , in some versions , “ grant - a - wish ”) experience : <PARA> further clues that the video was not real were in the description of the video on its youtube page : “ tommy douglas is granted his wish to score a touchdown for the los angeles traffic .” <PARA> while los angeles - area traffic is frequently described as being an entity unto itself , no such professional team by that name exists in los angeles .

false	on 9 december 2016 , a daily kos diarist set off a firestorm of controversy when the site posted a claim that the national park service filed paperwork specifically to block a “ million women march ” against president - elect donald trump planned for 21 january 2017 : <PARA> daily kos sourced its claims to an 8 december 2016 guardian piece which presented the conflict in a slightly different light : <PARA> on 8 december 2016 , the answer coalition issued a press release accusing the nps of censoring protests ( as well as creating a “ fake news ” distraction prior to the dispute ). however , according to a 9 december 2016 washington post article , the nps applied for “ sweeping ” permits more than a year before any inauguration ( and well before the november general election ): <PARA> according to reports , paperwork obtained by answer coalition supported the nps ’ s statement ; permits were obtained well before and had nothing to do with the results of the 2016 general election : <PARA> on 9 december 2016 , the national park service released a statement on social media indicating that attempts were underway to accommodate the protests . in that statement , nps noted that the permits were filed well before the election ( and thus well before the million women march was planned ), adding that permits may still be granted based on the space required for the inauguration : <PARA> no information suggests that this was an effort to quash demonstrations or dissent , or that groups planning protests were blocked from locations other than those regularly reserved by the nps as part of routine inauguration planning .	
false	among the toughest long - term challenges facing president - elect donald trump and the incoming 115th u . s . congress is ensuring the continued viability of the social security and medicare programs , both of which , according to reports by their boards of trustees , face insolvency by the year 2034 . <PARA> on 8 december 2016 , republican congressman sam johnson , chairman of the house ways and means social security subcommittee , introduced legislation — titled the social security reform act of 2016 ( h . r . 6489 ) — designed to “ permanently ” save social security : <PARA> among other measures proposed by johnson , the plan would gradually increase the normal retirement age to 69 , progressively reduce benefits for the top half ( in income ) of retirees , and limit cost - of - living adjustments and spousal benefits for the highest - income retirees , while increasing minimum benefits for those who earn the lowest . <PARA> no matter how it ’ s sliced and diced , johnson ’ s plan calls for benefit cuts — one of the biggest no - nos in american politics . all eyes are therefore on president - elect trump , who repeatedly said during the 2016 campaign that he would not consider cutting social security — or did he ? <PARA> former democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders certainly thinks trump said he wouldn ’ t : <PARA> but johnson ’ s plan has caused confusion , even among some who supported him , about trump ’ s own position on the issue . at snopes . com we ’ ve been inundated with questions about what trump does or doesn ’ t plan to do about social security , so we gathered together some of his more recent statements to see how they added up . on the whole — at least during the campaign — trump has consistently said he ’ s against cutting benefits , while acknowledging that the system needs fixing : <PARA> going back further in time , we found statements contradicting his statements during the campaign , such as when , in his 2000 book , the america we deserve , trump compared social security to a ponzi scheme . “ the pyramids are made of papier - mâché ,” he wrote , going on to suggest that the retirement age be raised to 70 and the system be at least partially privatized . but that was 16 years ago . he ’ s said nothing of the kind more recently . <PARA> according to an unnamed source quoted by bloomberg week in may 2016 , trump insisted during a conversation with house speaker paul ryan ( who has generally supported entitlements cuts and has spoken in favor of social security privatization ), that no republican who vowed to cut social security could win the presidential election : <PARA> there ’ s often a considerable disconnect between the promises candidates make on the campaign trail and the positions they take in office — especially when those promises differ from the stands taken by other powerful members of their own party — so we can ’ t predict whether or not donald trump will hold the line against any and all social security cuts . <PARA> but we can tell you with certainty that he said he would .

false	in december 2016 , a story surfaced about a young blue - eyed boy who was purportedly beaten by a “ muslim ” teenager because of his eye color , generally shared alongside an exhortation to pray for the child : <PARA> the photograph , however , was not taken in sweden , does not show a 12 - year - boy , and it does not show a victim of a blue - eyed beating . this image actually shows sophie willis , a 4 - year - old girl who was attacked by a rottweiler in cardiff in 2008 : <PARA> according to fria tider , a 15 - year - old slapped a fellow student after a disagreement about eye color . the original article does not state that the slapper was muslim , that he was an immigrant , or that the altercation resulted in serious injuries . the article did state that the boy ’ s first language was arabic , but this was used to illustrate the alleged cause of the altercation : a linguistic misunderstanding . <PARA> the original swedish story , however , was greatly exaggerated when it was republished by english - language web sites . <PARA> it is also worth noting that islam is a religion , not an ethnicity , and that it is possible to be muslim and also have blue eyes — or any eye color at all .	
true	in december 2016 , a meme surfaced , appearing to lay all the blame for a $ 6 billion cut to veteran pensions on senate democrats , while omitting the fact that the legislation was created ( at least in part ) by a republican . <PARA> the image concerns the bipartisan budget act of 2013 , which was the result of the highly - publicized negotiations between rep . paul ryan ( r - wi ) and sen . patty murray ( d - wa ). one clause in the bill called for cost - of - living adjustments ( also known as cola ) for retired u . s . military members under the age of 62 to be cut by 1 percent below inflation beginning in december 2015 . <PARA> the bill passed in the house on 12 december 2013 in a roll call vote by a margin of 332 - 94 , with 169 gop lawmakers joining 163 democratic counterparts in support of it . six days later , it passed in the senate in a 64 - 36 vote . and here the meme is accurate : senate democrats did vote as a block for the measure , joined by seven republicans and independents bernie sanders of vermont and angus king of maine . <PARA> ryan later penned an op - ed in usa today defending the bill — and the cola cut in particular : <PARA> however , that part of the law was repealed in february 2014 under a separate bill , this one introduced by sen . mark pryor ( d - ar ).	
false	a video purportedly showing a 50 - foot - long giant squid that washed up on a beach has been around for years , but made a big splash once again on social media in november 2016 : <PARA> the original image was taken in june 2012 , and showed a crowd of people gathered around a humpback whale ( not a squid ) that had washed ashore in white rock , british columbia , canada : <PARA> the photograph of the “ giant squid ” was created by cropping the original image and replacing the whale with a photograph of a squid . here ’ s a comparison of the two images : <PARA> this is not the first time that a photograph of a beached whale has been used as a digital media backdrop for giant squid hoaxes . in january 2014 , an image of whale was doctored and shared with a similar claim . however , neither story was true .	
true	on 2 november 2016 , reporter ann - derrick gaillot argued that a donald trump presidency — still only a possibility at the time — could be cut short thanks to the 25th amendment to the united states constitution : <PARA> six days later , trump was declared president - elect after winning the electoral college vote — but not the popular vote — against democrat hillary clinton . since then , more outlets have published pieces similar to gaillot ’ s , and former msnbc host keith olbermann posted a video commentary supporting what he called an “ instant impeachment ” of trump : <PARA> specifically , section four — which has never been invoked since the amendment ( which covers issues related to the presidential line of succession ) was adopted in 1967 — states : <PARA> if trump were to object to this declaration , the issue would be decided during a special congressional session : <PARA> in such a scenario , then , trump would step down and be replaced by his running mate , indiana governor mike pence .	
true	in late november 2016 , a claim appeared that the united kingdom ’ s new £ 5 bank notes contain beef tallow , a potential cause for concern among vegetarians and vegans who try to keep their contact with meat and meat industry byproducts to a minimum . <PARA> the bank of england decided to switch in 2013 , and introduced the new bills in september 2016 . it has touted the new pound notes ( which are made from long - lasting and difficult to tear plastic polymers , rather than cotton paper ) as cleaner , more durable , and better for the environment — as well as being far more difficult to counterfeit than their flimsier paper counterparts . <PARA> we contacted the bank of england to ask whether £ 5 bills ( and the £ 10 and £ 20 notes that they will be rolling out later ) contain beef tallow . a representative responded : <PARA> this is not the first time that the united kingdom has implemented polymer notes , as bbc reported in 2013 : <PARA> beef tallow is indeed a trace ingredient of the polymer used for the new £ 5 notes in the uk . however , their appropriateness for use by vegetarians and vegans remains entirely subjective .	
false	on 24 november 2016 , three months after the death of corona beer founder ( and grupo modelo chief executive officer ) antonino fernandez , stories appeared in various news outlets reporting that he had left € 200 million ( about $ 210 million ) to eighty residents of his hometown in spain , cerezales del condado : <PARA> while fernandez really did pass away in august 2016 , a spokeswoman from the fundación cerezales antonino y cinia — an arts and culture foundation established by fernandez — told reporters that the billionaire did not leave much of his fortune to the individuals residing in his boyhood village : <PARA> the misunderstanding seems to have stemmed from a mistranslation of articles published by spanish - language outlets , such as the local diario de león , which emphasized fernandez ’ s altruistic nature in their report following his death . however , it is not entirely clear how english - language outlets ended up with the particular story that they did : <PARA> the bbc reported that the details of fernandez ’ s will were unknown , but that the bulk of his fortune is expected to go to his family : <PARA> while it is possible that some of fernandez ’ s fortune will go to the place of his birth in spain , reports that every resident of cerezales del condado had become millionaires overnight thanks to the generosity of a beer mogul were premature , and based purely on speculation ( and possibly bad translation ).	
unproven	judge william h . pryor of the 11th circuit u . s . court of appeals has been in the news lately , both because his name reportedly appeared on president - elect donald trump ’ s definitive list of potential supreme court nominees , and because while serving as alabama ’ s attorney general pryor filed an amicus brief in support of a texas anti - sodomy law . <PARA> it was with some sense of irony , then , that in november 2016 , an old image purportedly showing william pryor posing nude for a gay porn magazine as a young man was recirculated online in november 2016 : <PARA> the rumor that pryor once posed nude for a gay porn magazine originated with a web site called “ legal schnauzer ” back in 2013 . that web site claimed that the photograph “ likely appeared in at least one print publication in the 1980s ” and was later published by the web site badpuppy . com in 1997 . however , the former reference is too vague to verify , and we were unable to find the image on badpuppy . ( legal schnauzer claims the image was removed from badpuppy , but not before the alabama bureau of investigations managed to capture a screenshot of it .) <PARA> the only copy of the photograph we could find unconnected to legal schnauzer ’ s posting appeared on the web site p - gay . com in a gallery of black and white nude images : <PARA> the assertion that the above - displayed photograph is a picture of judge william pryor is based on three factors : a supposed headshot of the model appears next to the name “ bill pryor ,” colleagues of the judge reportedly saw the photograph and exclaimed that it looked like him , and that the model and pryor both allegedly have “ strabismus ” ( i . e ., crossed - eyes ): <PARA> whatever the evidence provided by legal schnauzer , the alleged opinion of two unidentified officials isn ’ t proof of anything . furthermore , while whoever posed for the photograph may resemble pryor at first glance , a side - by - side comparison shows that certain features ( such as the nose ) seemingly don ’ t match : <PARA> — <PARA> but perhaps the most unbelievable aspect of this claim is simply that this photograph , which the alabama bureau of investigations ( abi ) and public officials have allegedly known about since the 1990s , has never been directly linked to pryor . the judge , who was nominated to the eleventh circuit by president george w . bush in 2003 , told the justice integrity project in 2013 that :	
unproven	on 14 november 2016 — not even a week after the results of the 2016 presidential election were announced — our inbox exploded with messages requesting that we investigate the claim that more than three million votes were cast by “ illegal immigrants ” or “ illegal aliens ” ( non - citizens ). in some cases it was also claimed that these three million voters are “ under investigation ” for fraud , or that three million votes for hillary clinton will be “ voided ” because they were illegal . under federal law , non - citizens cannot vote in a presidential election . <PARA> the first thing we found was that while no such claim has been reported in the mainstream media , it has been repeated on scores of partisan , right - leaning web sites since the 8 november election under the guise of “ news .” here are a few examples : <PARA> the reporting in this excerpt from infowars . com is typical : <PARA> we scoured at least a dozen such articles for evidence to support the claim , but found none . all of them pointed back to the same source : a pair of tweets by someone named gregg phillips , whose twitter profile identifies him as the founder of votestand (“ america ’ s first online fraud reporting app ”): <PARA> phillips offers no evidence whatsoever to back up the claim that he “ verified ” more than three million non - citizen votes . nor does he divulge his data sources or methodology , much less explain how it was possible to “ verify ” three million fraudulent votes within five days of a national election . in point of fact , phillips bluntly refuses to share this information with journalists , claiming it will be released “ in open form to the american people ”: <PARA> phillips , who also founded the technology consulting firm autogov and served as managing director of newt gingrich ’ s winning our future super pac during the 2012 presidential campaign , is no stranger to voter fraud controversies . he was quoted in a 30 october 2013 breitbart article ( which described phillips as a “ voter integrity activist ”) characterizing obamacare as “ the biggest voter registration fraud scheme in the history of the world .” per the requirements of the national voter registration act ( nvra ), obamacare health insurance exchange web sites provide voter registration services to customers . while some observers have complained that the exchanges are inadequate to the task of signing up new voters and have actually failed to register millions of eligible people , according to a 2014 msnbc report , others , gregg phillips among them , argue the opposite — that obamacare has opened the floodgates for millions to register illegally : <PARA> based on these past statements , it seems likely that phillips ’ case that three million non - citizens voted in the past election is related to his claim that “ illegals ” are registering to vote via obamacare . in the absence of supporting data , however , he has really made no case at all . the “ three million non - citizens ” figure may just as well have been plucked out of thin air .	
false	a photograph purportedly showing former president bill clinton sitting naked on a hotel bed while a woman rubbed his back suddenly appeared on social media in november 2016 and began to circulate as a legitimate image . <PARA> however , while the man featured in the image looks like clinton , this image does not feature the former president . this photograph was actually taken by alison jackson , a photographer known for using lookalikes to create images purportedly showing celebrities . <PARA> jackson writes on her web site that she uses lookalikes to create “ intimate , often salacious , imagined private moments ” of media icons like marilyn monroe , george bush , and bill clinton : <PARA> the staged photograph was later “ leaked ” by anonymous . however , looking over the artist ’ s site also turns up a photograph of “ princess diana ” giving the camera the finger , a semi - nude “ kate middleton ”, and “ george w . bush ” trying to figure out a rubik ’ s cube .	
false	president - elect donald trump spent considerable time during president obama ’ s tenure in office pushing the unfounded rumor that the commander - in - chief was not born in the united states : <PARA> questions about obama ’ s birthplace have long been settled . however , a new “ birther ” controversy arose during the 2016 presidential election , holding that donald trump was actually born in pakistan under the name “ dawood ibrahim khan ”: <PARA> the boy on the right - hand side of the above - displayed graphic is not donald trump . while we have yet to discover the exact origins of this photograph , this image has been circulating online since at least 2012 , when it was posted to the tumblr “ afghanistan in photos ,” where pulitzer - winner massoud hossaini was credited as the photographer . the photograph wasn ’ t attached to trump ’ s name until several years later . <PARA> the accompanying story also makes little sense . according to this rumor , trump didn ’ t arrive in the united states until after 1955 , when he was a 9 - year - old . yet several photographs document trump ’ s childhood with his family in new york : <PARA> furthermore , trump released his birth certificate in 2013 after a social media spat with comedian bill maher . trump was born on 14 june 1946 in queens , new york ( not pakistan ), and he was named donald john trump ( not dawood ibrahim khan ):

false	after the 8 november 2016 u . s . general election , a number of web sites reported that yale university “ coddled ” students by canceling exams or classes , apparently because of their distress over the election of donald trump : <PARA> the claim was aggregated by fox news , but as the material quoted here noted , the anecdote appeared to come from one single source on twitter : <PARA> a second tweet claimed a separate “ midterm ” had been significantly modified to accommodate student distress : <PARA> most accounts of the purported handwringing at yale could be traced back to victor ’ s 9 november 2016 tweet , and as mentioned in the piece , the professor ’ s name was not included in any accounts ( making them initially impossible to locate , and the claim thus difficult to verify ). <PARA> <USER> tweeted a front page indicating that the campus was “ despondent ” after trump ’ s win , but an accompanying headline indicated that students were “ denied dean ’ s excuses [ from academic obligations ]” related to the election : <PARA> the article reported : <PARA> the same article provided a name for the economics professor ( steven berry ), and added further detail : <PARA> as this far more detailed account noted , one examination was converted to a take - home version , and a second exam was deemed optional — both normal amendments to any syllabus . on 10 november 2016 , jon victor tweeted that other requests for extensions by students had been denied : <PARA> a report from a yale - based crowdsourced publication ( the tab ) critical of the rumors noted that students were not relieved from academic obligations : <PARA> official schedules for yale academics suggested that midterms were mostly held in late october 2016 , not early november 2016 . as is often the case with claims of collegiate fragility , the underlying details appeared to diverge dramatically from a simple claim of coddled students unable to cope with real - life events , with little background information painting a complete picture . <PARA> we have both contacted yale ’ s public relations department and steven berry for clarification , and on 11 november 2016 received a response from an individual party to the disruptions . the source confirmed there was little truth to the rumors about cancellations , describing the concerns as largely “ pedagogical ”: <PARA> adding that “[ s ] ome faculty made accommodations to 9 november 2016 ] tests ( but “ most did not ”), the source continued : <PARA> finally , the source stated that in hindsight , the distraction presented by the election in general was suboptimal with respect to exam timing . however , that individual confirmed that student exhaustion from staying up late to follow close election results ( not being “ upset by trump ”) was largely the cause of modification to coursework , and that the students affected by the phenomenon include both trump supporters and opponents . moreover , faculty expressed that the events were ones considered relevant and supplementary with respect to the courses in question , and professors wished to allow for students to fully process the policy detail and political significance ( not emotions ) of that notable event .	
false	on 9 november 2016 , web site fammtv published an article ( bearing the unquestionably provocative title : “ donald trump tell blacks “ kiss your section 8 , welfare & medicaid goodbye ”) which appeared to report that president - elect donald trump said he planned to get rid of assistance programs that are purportedly being abused by “ lazy ” americans : <PARA> the article ’ s lack of any substantiating material should have been a clue that it was not a real story . had trump made any sort of divisive or racist assertion of the sort ( such as implying that social programs like section 8 housing exist solely to benefit black people ), those comments would have been unquestionably newsworthy in the wake of his upset victory in the 2016 election . <PARA> united states presidents are not vested with the power to either create or pass laws on their own : <PARA> fammtv features no disclaimer we could find warning their readers that their content is fabricated , and typically spreads cynical , racially - targeted falsehoods . previous hoax stories published by this outlet include the claim that all unemployed “ baby mamas ” would be jailed if they failed to find jobs , that president barack obama amended the law to allow the purchase of hot food with snap benefits , and that the government targeted black women and their newborns via intentionally tainted epidurals .	
true	on 19 april 2010 , the left - leaning web site truthdig posted a two - page interview with one of the nation ’ s foremost intellectuals on the left , noam chomsky , in which the mit professor talks about the dark mood in the country and compares it to germany before the rise of the nazis . <PARA> after donald trump was elected president on 8 november 2016 , people began sharing a what appeared to be a prescient segment of the interview in which chomsky seems to describe trump and the wave of populist support that brought him to power : <PARA> while the statement was made long before trump was publicly discussing an electoral run , chomsky said that americans were feeling hopeless and left behind . his description of a “ charismatic figure ” that seizes on the disillusionment of working class and impoverished american whites sounds similar to trump ’ s appeal and some of the rhetoric that studded his campaign . <PARA> chomsky , who has written dozens of books on economics and foreign affairs , described his observations : <PARA> chomsky , then 81 , told hedges the new , globalized economic system has left people in a state of enraged inertia — from which they have no escape . the circumstances , he said , were unprecedented , at least in his memory , and they have created a roiling pot of despair , ripe for a certain type of leader to tell them a certain message : <PARA> critics of trump have pointed to his comments about mexican immigrants and muslim people , accusing him of exploiting the discontent of white americans who feel left behind by a globalized job force and international trade deals , and increasingly fearful of an ever more diverse country with a shrinking white population .	
true	in september 2016 , candidate donald trump announced his intention to appoint myron ebell to lead his administration ’ s transition team at the environmental protection agency . ebell currently serves as the director of the center for energy and environment at the libertarian think tank the competitive enterprise institute . he also chairs an initiative named the cooler heads coalition , which , according to ebell ’ s official bio : <PARA> ebell openly declares himself to be a climate change skeptic who disputes the severity of human activity on earth ’ s climate . on this point , ebell has been extremely consistent : he argues that anthropogenic global warming , if it happens at all , is a minor issue that has been usurped by liberals to expand the federal government . he has stated in many different venues that he intends to dismantle the scientific consensus around anthropogenic global warming , as discussed in this october 23 2012 interview with pbs frontline ’ s john hockenberry : <PARA> ebell , as noted in a 2007 vanity fair article , is often contacted by journalists for sound bites representing the opposing view to scientific , peer reviewed studies despite the fact that ebell is not actually a scientist : he holds an m . s degree in economics from the london school of economics . his scientific view on global warming was well summarized in that 2007 article : <PARA> a september 2016 article in scientific american suggests that his appointment heralds big , divisive changes to to the epa : <PARA> the great irony of his appointment to lead the epa transition is that he is lukewarm on the existence of the epa in the first place . in fact , he once described newt gingrich ’ s suggestion to abolish the epa as “ bold and visionary .”

false	on september 28 2016 , the conspiracy blog “ ufosightingshotspot ” presented two unrelated stories as if they were part of the same news item . one reported on an upcoming supermoon event , and the other discussed a recent seismology study that looked for evidence that lunar cycles may partially predict earthquakes . <PARA> the connection implied by conflation of the two stories , although not explicitly made on the ufo blog , was amplified by other outlets such as the uk ’ s daily star tabloid , who wrote : <PARA> supermoons occur when the moon is simultaneously full and at the closest point to earth in its orbit ( a phenomenon known as perigee ). as reported by nasa , the supermoon on 14 november 2016 will be the largest one ( i . e ., the one in which the moon approaches closest to earth ) since 1948 and will not be surpassed until 2032 . <PARA> the information about the connection between earthquakes and lunar cycles is less set in stone , so to speak . the paper the conspiracy post references is an authentic study published in the 12 september 2016 issue of the scientific journal nature geoscience . in that paper ’ s introduction , the scientists noted that the possible correlation between seismic activity and lunar cycles has been a long - standing debate in seismology : <PARA> this study added to that body of research by investigating stress caused by the tidal pull of the moon prior to a number of major earthquakes worldwide , as reported by the washington post ’ s sarah kaplan : <PARA> as noted by the researchers , these periods of stress would be most marked during either a full moon or a new moon when the sun , earth , and moon are generally aligned ( an orbital arrangement known as a syzygy ). in the researcher ’ s model of how tidal stress and earthquakes might interact , those periods of high stress make it more likely that minor , deeper fractures will propagate into larger catastrophic events : <PARA> this conclusion is a far cry from the reported suggestion that the 14 november supermoon , specifically , will cause “ tidal ” waves and earthquakes , as the study did not make a single mention of these events . the study is also still preliminary : <PARA> furthermore , the difference in tidal stress caused between a supermoon alignment and a run - of - the - mill syzygy ( which occur at periodicities of 14 . 8 days ) is probably negligible since tidal forces themselves are fairly minor , as discussed by bad astronomy ’ s phil plait : <PARA> in 2011 , nasa goddard space center chief scientist james garvin responded to similar questions about a possible supermoon - tectonics connection , concluding that it was unlikely to have much of an effect at all :

false	in may 2016 , syndicated talk radio host sean hannity aired an item claiming that donald trump had sent a plane to give 200 stranded u . s . marines a much - needed ride home after operation desert storm in 1991 : <PARA> the story came up several times during the course of the 2016 presidential campaign ( cpl . stickney even told it in person at a trump rally ), but skeptics questioned its validity despite a statement from the trump campaign allegedly confirming it : “ the trump campaign has confirmed to hannity . com that mr . trump did indeed send his plane to make two trips from north carolina to miami , florida to transport over 200 gulf war marines back home . no further details were provided .” <PARA> the few details we do have about trump ’ s alleged participation don ’ t , in fact , add up . <PARA> we can confirm , based on military records , that the 209 - member anti - tank ( tow ) company , part of the 8th tank battalion for operation desert shield , deployed to camp lejeune , north carolina , from their home base in miami on 26 november 1990 . and we can confirm that the company deployed from camp lejeune to saudi arabia on 22 december , served throughout the combat phase of operation desert storm ( from 17 january to 28 february 1991 ), and returned to north carolina in april . a command chronology of the deployment notes that a “ cpl . stickey ” was among those receiving certificates of commendation . <PARA> we can also confirm , via a 23 april 1991 article from the sun - sentinel , that a series of flight delays stalled the company ’ s homecoming to miami on 22 april , but that they finally did arrive home after split across two separate flights . stickney ’ s photograph shows that he arrived on a plane marked “ trump ,” but it also proves something else : that even if trump did send the plane , it wasn ’ t his private jet . <PARA> that trump didn ’ t send the pictured plane at all was something noted by a sharp - eyed reader , who wrote to us to note : <PARA> the markings of the plane in stickney ’ s photo match those of the trump shuttle fleet , so the question becomes : did trump himself send a trump shuttle to retrieve the stranded marines , or was it procured some other way ? <PARA> to arrive at an answer , it ’ s necessary to go into a bit of the history of trump shuttle . a july 2015 article in nyc aviation detailed trump ’ s short - lived airline industry involvement , beginning with an entirely separate carrier , eastern air shuttle , which he immediately rebranded with his own name : <PARA> given that the bankers , not donald trump , owned trump shuttle from september 1990 until it was sold to u . s . air in 1996 , trump wasn ’ t in a position to send the planes anywhere , much less on a spur - of - the - moment marine transport mission . so who did ? as it turns out , the u . s . military itself chartered the flights — a common practice in the day , according to an 11 august 2016 report by the washington post : <PARA> kondra ’ s notes on the flight are declassified and available online and show a contract for trump shuttle to “ move troops in [ the ] continental united states ” during the 1990 - 91 timeframe : <PARA> so the real story underlying the claim that donald trump personally sent his jet to pick up stranded soldiers and return them to the u . s . is that the military paid to charter a plane from an airline trump no longer owned in order to bring those service personnel home .	
false	rumors holding that hillary clinton had a “ meltdown ,” threw a water glass at a staffer , and engaged in a curse - filled tirade following nbc ’ s commander - in - chief forum with host matt lauer have been circulating since the democratic presidential nominee participated in that forum , which aired on 7 september 2016 . while these rumors did seem to be rooted in a little truth — the clinton campaign was not happy with the questions lauer asked ( or didn ’ t ask ) during the event — claims that clinton threw a “ hissy fit ” over it were unfounded . <PARA> the website victurus libertas was the first to promulgate this rumor , publishing an article headlined “ temper ! temper ! hillary goes on rampage for over an hour — throwing glass at staffer ’ s head .” although victurus libertas linked to credible reports from ny mag and yahoo ! news detailing that clinton ’ s campaign was miffed with lauer for not fact - checking republican candidate donald trump during the event , they cited politico as their source for the claim that clinton had thrown a water glass at a staffer : <PARA> none of this information appeared in the cited politico report , however . <PARA> politico published an article headlined “ liberals lash out at lauer , nbc ,” reporting that clinton ’ s campaign and supporters were upset with interviewer lauer for posing “ unbalanced questions ”: <PARA> but politico did not report that hillary clinton threw a water glass at anyone ’ s head , threatened the firing of matt lauer , or called donald trump a “ fascist fuck .” all of that was invented by victurus libertas in an apparent attempt to smear the democratic candidate , and it served as the basis for a longer , highly embellished version of the rumor that began circulating via e - mail in october 2016 : <PARA> the earliest iteration of that longer narrative we could uncover was posted to the message board of the web site mtstars , where it was presented without citations , source information , audio , video , or any other documentation that the described these events actually transpired . it should also be noted that no credible news outlets reported that clinton went on a cursed - filled tirade after the commander - in - chief forum , or that she threw a water glass at a staffer ’ s head . <PARA> rumors that clinton threw a “ tantrum ” after nbc ’ s commander - in - chief forum started with a fictitious quote , and that narrative was later expanded with more fake quotes from other anonymous sources . meanwhile , no actual evidence has surfaced to prove that any of these events actually transpired .	
unproven	as many as one in five americans suffers from chronic migraine headaches , an episodic condition exacerbated by a lack of consistent treatment options . many migraine sufferers struggle to avoid known triggers but inevitably experience periodic ( and crippling ) episodes . <PARA> perhaps owing to the hit - and - miss nature of migraine treatment , anecdotal claims about preventing , alleviating , or even stopping migraines altogether abound online . in mid - 2015 , sufferers began spreading an article that maintained a specific kind of ear piercing ( known as a “ daith piercing ”) could alleviate migraines . <PARA> the article was published by a student - run web site at state university of new york ( suny ) purchase and titled “ a ‘ piercing ’ new alternative for migraine relief ”: <PARA> bergman was the only medical professional quoted in the article , which primarily included comment from migraine sufferers and body modification studio owners . evidence presented about the efficacy of daith piercings for migraine relief was purely anecdotal ( and the source of the claim unclear ): <PARA> at this juncture , it ’ s worth noting a specific aspect of the daith piercing claim . while body modification may be inexpensive ( compared to other alternative health options ), it involves an aesthetic commitment that might not appeal to sufferers . slightly less common than ear lobe piercings , a daith piercing likely wouldn ’ t physically harm a patient desperate for relief , but many sufferers could feel pressured to try it despite personal considerations ( such as employer dress codes or discomfort with a cartilage piercing ). <PARA> moreover , no non - anecdotal evidence was presented in the article touting the potential efficacy of such piercings . even the health professional consulted ( who adopted a “ can ’ t hurt ” stance ) hadn ’ t heard of the rumor , much less matched it with any extant medical advice about migraine relief . no studies examined the potential benefit of ear piercings on migraine headaches , though some research has been carried out on acupuncture and migraines . <PARA> due in part to a dearth of steady treatment options for migraine sufferers , the efficacy of acupuncture on the condition has long been scrutinized in clinical settings . data has been inconsistent but strongly favors a pronounced placebo effect in patients exposed to both “ real ” acupuncture and “ sham ” acupuncture ( treatments that mimicked acupuncture in ways indetectable to the patients ): <PARA> researchers similarly theorized the negligible difference between true and simulated acupuncture suggested factors other than the alternative therapy itself influenced outcomes : <PARA> overall , clinicians generally adopted the stance that while acupuncture was of questionable benefit , it wasn ’ t a harmful option for most patients resistant to first - line therapies : <PARA> the article proposing daith piercings as a migraine treatment didn ’ t specify whether its conclusions were based on rumor or inference and didn ’ t cite any non - anecdotal evidence specifically supporting ear piercings as a viable alternative to acupuncture . no part of the article demonstrated a piercing would even work in the manner acupuncture purportedly did . how acupuncture ’ s scant benefits could even be approximated by a permanent body piercing wasn ’ t explained or referenced ( and a number of social media users with the piercing report no reduction in episodic migraines ). <PARA> even if daith piercings were deemed a sufficient analogue to acupuncture treatment ( for which we could find no evidence ), acupuncture itself is controversial at best and of exceptionally limited benefit ( often a “ last ditch ” option among patients for whom all other treatments have failed ). accepted medical science generally holds it poses little risk , but clinical proof of its benefits remains elusive despite extensive research . <PARA> in short , acupuncture itself is a scientifically questionable therapy even when administered by protocol ; daith piercings as an acupuncture proxy goes several steps further into the territory of shaky folk medicine . like acupuncture , daith piercings are unlikely to hurt or harm most patients . however , cartilage piercings are uncomfortable to painful to receive and would likely be considered unsightly or undesirable by the vast majority of sufferers who stand to benefit from the purported treatment .	
mixture	in january 2002 , the american journal of neuroradiology published a study titled “ change in brain size during and after pregnancy : study in healthy women and women with preeclampsia ,” which , based on before - during - after - pregnancy mri scans of 14 women ’ s brains , concluded that “ the brain decreases in size during pregnancy and increases in size after delivery . the changes follow a consistent time course in each woman .” a six - month time period for a postpartum brain ’ s return to its pre - pregnancy size is also referenced in this study , so it is therefore likely that this paper was the primary source of information for the image reproduced above . <PARA> what is less clear is how relevant this limited study is to a broader population of pregnant women . the study was originally set up to test differences in brain volume through pregnancy between nine healthy women and five women with a condition known as preeclampsia ( a pregnancy disorder whose primary symptoms are high blood pressure and large amounts of protein in the urine ). lead researcher dr . anita holdcroft discussed this in a 1997 new scientist article that shared her group ’ s preliminary results : <PARA> this research focus , however , demonstrated that the limited sample size was not intended to be representative of the population at large . <PARA> furthermore , a 2016 review paper that ( in part ) searched for any study relating to changes in the shape or structure of the brain during pregnancy did not mention a single subsequent study that replicated — or attempted to replicate — the 2002 study . <PARA> one of the main reasons the finding of pregnant brain shrinkage seems to have resonated so well on the internet ( in spite of the sparse amount of research on the topic ) is that it serves , incorrectly , as a simple and tidy explanation for the mental cloudiness or forgetfulness women sometimes report during pregnancy . <PARA> dr . holdcroft hinted at this connection in the new scientist article , but the final 2002 paper published by her team five years later conceded that “ the mechanism and physiologic importance of these findings are speculative at the present time .” she also mentioned in that article that the culprit for reduced brain volume was likely not caused by a reduction in the number of brain cells , but by decreases in each cell ’ s individual volume . <PARA> while research has documented impairment to some cognitive functions in pregnant women , it is important to note this body of research has not demonstrated an actual decline in mental capacity . it is equally important to note that these studies do not suggest that a shrunken brain is the culprit for this effect , either . <PARA> this subject remains one of those many gray areas ( pun retroactively intended ) in science — far too gray for the certainty implied by a two - sentence social media image .

mixture	the coordinated islamist militia attacks on the u . s . embassy and a nearby cia annex in benghazi , libya , in september 2012 left four americans dead ( including u . s . ambassador j . christopher stevens ) and cast a lingering shadow over the obama administration , particularly secretary of state hillary clinton , on whose watch the attacks took place . the issue of who was to blame for security deficiencies that made it possible for the attacks to occur dogged democratic presidential nominee clinton all throughout the 2016 presidential campaign . <PARA> one way in which clinton ’ s defenders responded to accusations of fault on her part was by circulating statistics about comparable attacks that allegedly occurred during previous administrations . one such list cites incidents from the presidencies of republicans george w . bush and ronald reagan : <PARA> the not - so - subtle implication is that clinton ’ s partisan accusers are hypocritical for heaping condemnation ( and investigations ) on her , but not on her republican counterparts . <PARA> but how valid are the facts and figures ? carefully considered , they ’ re not as straightforward and pat as they might seem at first glance . for starters , what were the criteria used to make the comparisons ? does “ embassy attack ” mean one that literally occurs on embassy grounds , near embassy grounds , or includes assaults on u . s . diplomatic personnel regardless of location ? are we only considering attacks that resulted in fatalities ? if so , must as least some of those fatalities be americans ? the parameters are adjustable . the statistics vary accordingly . <PARA> basing an examination on the somewhat inconsistent information compiled by various sources ( see references below ), and restricting our criteria to attacks resulting in fatalities , we found around 20 attacks that targeted u . s . embassies and diplomatic personnel over the course of the george w . bush administration . by narrowing the criteria further to exclude offsite attacks on vehicles , motorcades , and the like , we boiled that number down to 13 : <PARA> at 65 , our tally of the deaths resulting from embassy attacks during the bush administration is one short of that provided in the internet list ( as we mentioned above , the available information on these attacks tends to be slightly inconsistent ). four of those deaths were americans , three of whom were diplomatic personnel . one can argue that the comparison between these 13 incidents and benghazi is strained , however , in that four u . s . personnel were killed in the benghazi attack alone . one might further object that only attacks in which americans were killed ought to be counted in the first place , in which case the number of pertinent attacks under george w . bush would total three rather than thirteen . <PARA> in any case , congress did not see fit to investigate any of those incidents . <PARA> we can ’ t figure out how the author of the image came up with 10 embassy attacks under ronald reagan ( we only count four that involved fatalities ). it ’ s clear from the stated number of u . s . citizens killed , however , that at least one of the incidents included under this heading doesn ’ t belong there , and we ’ re guessing it ’ s the 1983 truck bombing of the u . s . marine barracks in beirut , lebanon ( not a diplomatic facility ), which killed 241 marines — and , for the record , was the subject of an official investigation . <PARA> the most notable attack on a diplomatic target that did occur during the reagan presidency was the truck bombing of the u . s . embassy in beirut on 18 april 1983 . some 63 people were killed in that attack , including 17 u . s . citizens , some of whom worked for the cia . that incident , too , was investigated , according to a report from the new york times : <PARA> in the end , it seems to be the beirut embassy incident that ’ s most fittingly compared to benghazi . at 17 , the number of u . s . citizens killed in that single beirut attack is greater than that of all the embassy attacks occurring during the bush and obama administrations combined . but though it was similarly criticized and investigated — and for similar reasons — its aftermath lacked the partisan zeal brought to bear on benghazi .

false	david avocado wolfe , an alternative health guru / meme generator who believes , among other things , that chocolate is an octave of masculine solar energy , authored a widely shared post titled “ reverse cavities and heal tooth decay with these 5 steps !” while the meat of his post was a list of five dietary suggestions of varying scientific validity aimed at cavity prevention , he opened his article with this questionable statement about reversing tooth decay through the use of vitamin d : <PARA> the claims of “ reversing ” tooth decay were misrepresented with before - and - after photographs of a tooth exhibiting a deep cavity that was seemingly restored to its original pristine state , which were also used as the featured image when the post was shared on social media : <PARA> the study wolfe cited was published in a 1932 issue of the british medical journal under the title “ remarks on the influence of a cereal - free diet rich in vitamin d and calcium on dental caries in children ,” and its actual conclusions were outlined well by the three points included in its summary : <PARA> wolfe claimed that this study showed it was possible to regenerate the material lost to cavities ( or dental caries ), but it does not . instead , it reported that children with previously documented cases of thin or deficient ( i . e ., hypoplastic ) enamel displayed signs that the progress of their tooth decay slowed or “ almost ” halted when they were put on a vitamin d - rich diet that also restricted cereal , thus preventing additional cavities from forming . <PARA> affecting the processes that regulate tooth enamel through diet is not a new or groundbreaking concept . enamel — a mineral not composed of living cells — is constantly being destroyed or remineralized based on the ecology of one ’ s mouth , as described in a review paper published in the journal of the american dental association : <PARA> claims that vitamin d can aid in the remineralization part of that process are not universally accepted , however . a 2013 meta - analysis of clinical studies investigating links between vitamin d and cavities made the ( qualified ) suggestion that vitamin d might play a role in the prevention of cavities , but this finding has been challenged by more recent research . <PARA> regardless , creating or repairing dentin — the deeper but still primarily mineralized portion of your tooth whose decay necessitates a filling — is an entirely different beast . of the three different kinds of dentin ( primary , secondary , and tertiary ), tertiary is the only kind that does anything close to regrow , and this new material acts only to slow or stop the growth of a cavity , not reverse it . even if it could refill the area degraded by a cavity ( which it can ’ t ), that replacement material would be weaker than the material it replaced . <PARA> finally , to actually generate anything close to a natural dentin “ filling ”, you would have to generate new dental pulp cells , the living tissue that leads to the creation of dentin . food — vitamin d notwithstanding — doesn ’ t spontaneously turn into living dental pulp cells , nor does it facilitate the spontaneous generation of them . unless your diet consists of a healthy serving of human stem cells and has the benefit of an extremely precise set of laboratory - regulated conditions , the food you eat will not produce new ones .

false	on 10 october 2016 , the hillary clinton shill site daily news bin published an article claiming that newsweek magazine had uncovered “ absolut [ e ] proof ” wikileaks had published fabricated e - mails in their october 2016 “ podesta emails ” archive , maintaining that journalist kurt eichenwald had determined many of those documents were “ phony ”: <PARA> the article was based on a 10 october 2016 piece penned by eichenwald which went viral and has since been significantly edited . daily news bin asserted that eichenwald “ proved ” the inauthenticity of “ podesta emails ” in his article , but what his piece actually claimed was that the russian news outlet sputnik had ( deliberately ) misreported the content of a leaked e - mail , and that donald trump ’ s repetition of that misreporting <PARA> proved he was sourcing information fed to him by russian propaganda outlets attempting to manipulate the 2016 election in trumps ’ favor . <PARA> what eichenwald wrote was that a leaked e - mail showed that clinton confidante sidney blumenthal had forwarded to clinton campaign manager john podesta a lengthy article he ( i . e ., eichenwald ) had written , but the russian news outlet sputnik misreported the nature of that e - mail and claimed that blumenthal himself had penned the material he forwarded to podesta : <PARA> in other words , sputnik falsely made it sound as if a hillary clinton insider , rather than a newsweek reporter , had opined that the attack on the u . s . diplomatic compound in benghazi was preventable , and that it was legitimate for congress to investigate hillary clinton ’ s role in the tragedy . unfortunately , some of eichenwald ’ s phrasing made it sound as though he were claiming that russians had altered or fabricated the content of e - mails published by wikileaks , rather than that a russian news outlet had simply ( and perhaps deliberately ) misrepresented what a real leaked e - mail actually contained : <PARA> eichenwald explained at length that he believed the “ altered document ” purportedly used by sputnik was part of a disinformation campaign being waged by russia against hillary clinton . but what eichenwald did not say any point in his article ( or its updates ) was that he suspected wikileaks of altering the documents they published , or of publishing fake documents . <PARA> adding to the confusion was that eichenwald ’ s account was itself not without potential error , particularly his claim that events proved the trump campaign was picking up disinformation from russian sources for the gop candidate to use against clinton . buzzfeed ‘ s john passantino was able to quickly point out some cracks in eichenwald ’ s claims , primarily that sputnik had not published their story until hours after a “ viral tweet ” containing the same information had been circulated among trump supporters : <PARA> nymag ‘ s jesse singal also pointed out that a likely scenario was that trump had merely repeated then - popular internet rumors without checking their provenance rather than being propagandized by russia : <PARA> daily news bin ‘ s misrepresentation of eichenwald ’ s ( likely ) misinterpretation of events functioned like an online version of the “ telephone ” game , generating a misunderstanding that eichenwald had proved wikileaks published forged documents .	
unproven	an early october 2016 audio leak of donald trump ’ s making lewd comments about women became a huge political controversy , and several subsequent articles suggested a callous trump divorced his first wife , ivana , wholly or in part because he didn ’ t like her breast implants . <PARA> a 1 october 2016 piece published in the economist ( its claim reiterated by the washington post ) held that : <PARA> the claim was not new in october 2016 . in september and march 2016 respectively , the atlantic and the national review had referenced details of trump ’ s purported leaking lewd criticism of his then - wife ’ s enhancements to “ new york tabloids ”: <PARA> the rumor has taken several forms . for example , a profile of ivana trump published in march 2016 maintained that her former husband had insulted her breasts while he was speaking to a reporter : <PARA> and back in 1990 , vanity fair ‘ s coverage of the then - recent trump split told a story not dissimilar from the one circulating more than a quarter - century later : <PARA> ultimately , the oft - repeated claim was two - fold : in part , it maintained that trump was anywhere between recoiling from and publicly leaking disparaging comments about his own wife ’ s augmented breasts to “ the new york tabloids .” the second layer of the rumor held trump separated from ivana because her breasts were “ all wrong .” in some versions , trump is merely quoted as making the off - color remarks with no mention of how that information was obtained . in others , trump is said to have openly made the comments in an “ interview ” with a tabloid . and in 2016 , trump ’ s hostility at ivana was escalated in the retelling to suggest he “ leaked ” the claim to the media , and split with her in part because of her breast implants . <PARA> seemingly missing from all iterations of this rumor about ivana trump ’ s breast implants ( and her ex - husband ’ s opinion of them ) are the basic who , what , when , where , and why aspects . the 1990 vanity fair did not allude to any source for the claim trump had criticized “ those plastic breasts ,” merely including the line among several others describing the alleged mistreatment mrs . trump endured . had the comments been contemporaneously published by any news outlets , that information likely would have been included in the vanity fair piece to bolster the impact and credibility of the sourceless anecdote . <PARA> the claim has since skittered about like tumbleweeds , eventually attracting the details that trump referenced ivana ’ s “ plastic breasts ” in an interview , then that he leaked the criticism to the media ( for unknown reasons ), then that he divorced ivana over breast implants of which he did not approve . <PARA> although the rumor has circulated in various forms since 1990 , we have been unable to locate any published interview in which trump made any such comments , nor any tabloid material from around 1990 featuring criticism ( by anyone ) of ivana trump ’ s implants . <PARA> it ’ s certainly possible that some version of the rumor may be true , but we haven ’ t unearthed any proof that donald trump ever directly , indirectly , or privately made the comments attributed to him about ivana trump ’ s breast implants , nor that he divorced her because of aesthetic differences about their suitability .

mixture	for years , rumors have circulated about gummi candies using car wax as an ingredient , a claim that appears most often in listicles about strange ingredients in foodstuffs , but also as a “ shocking ” reason you shouldn ’ t eat such candies published on health sites that also carry endless articles about “ toxins .” <PARA> but what ’ s the truth ? the short answer is yes , haribo ’ s popular fruit - flavored gummi bears brand candies are finished with carnauba wax , as plainly stated on the haribo web site : <PARA> the primary ingredients in gummi bears are sugar , glucose syrup , starch , flavoring , food coloring , citric acid , and gelatin . in the haribo candies , carnauba wax — produced from leaves of brazilian trees that secrete carnauba wax to protect them from the hot sun — finishes off the product with a shiny glaze for aesthetic purposes . <PARA> well , just how much wax is in that gummi bear , anyway ? <PARA> in the united states , food product labels must list all ingredients in decreasing order by weight . in other words , the most plentiful ingredient ( by weight ) is listed first , and the least plentiful ingredient is last . looking at a label of haribo gummy bear ingredients , we see that carnauba wax is listed last , even after artificial colors such as yellow # 5 , red # 40 , and blue # 1 : <PARA> in an article discussing the ingredients of gummi candies in general ( not specifically the haribo gold bear brand ), carnauba wax is mentioned as a 2 % polishing agent . that is , the carnauba wax that is applied to the outside of the gummi candies consists of only 2 % carnauba wax along with other ingredients ( e . g ., water , mineral oils , vegetable oils ). <PARA> no articles we could find provide an exact amount of carnauba wax used an ingredient in gummies and other candies , but its volume in a given candy appears to be fairly minor . <PARA> on drugs . com , carnauba wax is described as “ a safe , non - toxic , and inert ingredient .” the melting point of carnauba wax is 180 degrees fahrenheit , which means it doesn ’ t melt in the human body and passes , unabsorbed , through our intestinal systems . <PARA> in contrast , car waxes typically contain approximately 30 % carnauba wax ( and presumably taste quite a bit different ). <PARA> readers may also be interested in knowing that carnauba wax not only appears in jelly beans , gob stoppers , skittles , dubble bubble gumballs , and a variety of other candies with hard shiny exteriors , but it is also used as a coating on medications to make them easier to swallow .	
false	in september 2016 , the free thought project web site published an article that led to claims a judge had ruled that “ the government ” could “ ban vegetable gardens ” because they ’ re “ ugly ”: <PARA> predictably , the claim aused widespread outrage on social media due in part to the growing popularity of vegetable gardens and local produce . the rumor was condensed to conclude that a precedent enabling the banning of independent vegetable growth throughout florida ( or all of the u . s .) had been set by a judge because such gardens are unsightly , and that miami shores officials wished for all vegetable gardens to be replaced with grass . <PARA> the “ tyrannical ” tale also made it to the miami herald , which presented a more balanced version of events to readers . as it turned out , carroll and ricketts weren ’ t prohibited “ by the government ” from growing any and all vegetables ; rather , the miami shores jurisdiction simply stipulates , as part of local landscaping codes , that such gardens should not be placed in the front yards of homes : <PARA> code regulations in miami shores village ( division 17 , sec . 536 [ e ]) pertaining to landscaping state that “ vegetable gardens are permitted in rear yards only .” <PARA> it is true that a miami shores couple fought and lost a court battle with the village to retain their front - yard vegetable garden , but the court ’ s decision in no way “ banned vegetable gardens ,” much less constituted a sweeping ruling applicable anywhere outside miami shores . a local judge simply sided with miami shores village in ruling that the jurisdiction had a right to enforce extant landscaping codes , which permit vegetable gardens in rear yards but not front ones . the couple involved were not prohibited from growing vegetables , simply from doing so in the front yard . <PARA> the rumor about a vegetable garden ban was one of several that severely distort local controversies over individual management of personal resources such as food and water to suggest the government is hostile to rugged individualists . a similar distortion asserted a man was arrested for collecting rainwater , and another inaccurately claimed michigan repealed its “ right to farm act ” ( and presumably the right to farm along with it ).	
mixture	on 26 july 2016 , michigan cherry farmer marc santucci shared a post on facebook asserting that he was forced to destroy 14 percent of his tart cherry crop in order to protect the market for cherries imported from overseas : <PARA> santucci ’ s post slowly circulated on the social network , attracting the attention of blogs and health - conscious social media users through september 2016 . as presented , santucci ’ s tale sounded like an unbelievable level of bureaucratic interference with the farm industry and left readers wondering whether his report about having to destroy 40 , 000 pounds of edible cherries in order to “ make room ” for imported cherries ( and was “ not allowed to donate or in any way use diverted cherries ”) was accurate . <PARA> online articles pinned blame for the cherry - chucking on the united states department of agriculture ( usda ), citing a 29 july 2016 detroit free press article about the social media controversy that referenced the federal agricultural agreement act of 1937 . the detroit free press article only briefly mentioned the usda as a starting point for a very complex cherry charter , noting that cherries were originally not regulated under the agricultural agreement act , but the cherry industry opted into its provisions in 1995 . <PARA> the act in question was introduced in 1937 due to tumultuous agricultural conditions that exacerbated the great depression and aimed to facilitate “ orderly marketing conditions for agricultural commodities in interstate commerce ” for the express purpose of stabilizing farmers ’ income . cherry industry experts stressed that the 1995 extension of the regulation to include the tart cherry market was voluntary and had been desired by many cherry farmers : <PARA> a 29 july 2016 editorial published in the michigan farm news also addressed what it framed as multiple misrepresentations in santucci ’ s viral post , starting with the reason cherry crops were thusly regulated . a horticulture specialist noted that the cherry farmers themselves ( not the usda ) had sought market regulation after experiencing damaging price fluctuations : <PARA> generally , the agricultural agreement act ensures relatively stable income for tart cherry farmers in the face of a volatile market , with one of the drawbacks of that stability being that in boom crop years ( as 2016 was ), farmers may end up with a good deal of product they are precluded from selling on the open market . however , although some outlets claim ciab heavies visited farms to ensure every cherry lies unchomped , tart cherry farmers have options beyond leaving their surplus crop to “ rot in the sun ”: <PARA> likewise , the michigan farm news piece stated that : <PARA> santucci himself told grand rapids television station wxmi that the dumping of surplus cherries wasn ’ t expressly mandatory , but their short shelf life makes it difficult to find alternative uses for them : <PARA> it was true that santucci ’ s 2016 crop was ( as with that of all other cherry growers ) subject to a growers ’ agreement barring surplus cherries from the marketplace , and santucci asserted he had insufficient time to properly divert his surplus cherries to other uses or markets . but the agreement under which the tart cherry market is regulated doesn ’ t mandate surplus cherries be destroyed , nor does the protocol exist to protect foreign imports . cherry growers in several states voluntarily opted in to a usda marketing agreement ( rather than being forcibly regulated ) following a period of instability in the cherry industry , and agriculture experts widely agree the provision provides more protection than harm to cherry growers .

mixture	on 11 september 2001 , as news outlets in new york , the united states , and around the world struggled to keep up with unfolding reports of that day ’ s terrorist attacks on the world trade center , newscasters from local television station wwor spoke live on the air with donald trump about the event by telephone . <PARA> trump described how he had witnessed the attack from an office window that looked directly onto the world trade center and answered questions from the newscasters about subjects such as whether he was taking any precautions to protect his own buildings and what the city would need to do to recover from the attacks : <PARA> fifteen years later , as trump was in the midst of a heated national campaign as the republican party ’ s presidential nominee , a clip of that interview was widely featured online along with derogatory statements asserting that it captured trump ’ s “ bragging ” that the trump building ( a 71 - story skyscraper at 40 wall street ) had become the “ tallest in downtown manhattan ” once the wtc towers fell : <PARA> what donald trump literally said that day was : “ 40 wall street actually was the second - tallest building in downtown manhattan , and it was actually before the world trade center the tallest , and and then when they built the world trade center it became known as the second - tallest , and now it ’ s the tallest and i just spoke to my people , and they said it ’ s the most unbelievable sight , it ’ s probably seven or eight blocks away from the world trade center , and yet wall street is littered with two feet of stone and brick and mortar and steel ...” <PARA> so it is true that during the course of that interview , in response to a query about whether his own buildings had sustained any damage , trump stated , in reference to the trump building , that “ now it ’ s the tallest ” [ in downtown manhattan ]. whether that remark constituted “ bragging ” is a matter of subjective interpretation , however . <PARA> critics maintain that trump ’ s referencing the relative height of 40 wall street in the immediate aftermath of the world trade center towers ’ fall was completely gratuitous and irrelevant to the discussion , the hallmark of an egoist with no compunctions about using tragedy as an opportunity for self - promotion . <PARA> but in the context of the full interview , trump ’ s remarks could perhaps be considered defensible . <PARA> first of all , the newscasters to whom trump was speaking were appealing to their audience by repeatedly referring to his status in the new york real estate community , describing him as the “ man behind lots of real estate in manhattan ” and a “ visionary in new york real estate ,” and they specifically asked him about the trump tower and the trump building , which they termed “ one of the great tourist attractions in the world ” and “ one of the landmark buildings down in the financial district ,” respectively . it was to be expected that he would respond to those lead - ins with at least a little bit of subtle swagger ( which he expressed matter - of - factly rather than hyperbolically ). <PARA> second , trump ’ s remark was made in response to questions about whether his buildings had sustained any damage and whether he was taking any precautions to protect them . in the chaos of that day , it wasn ’ t too much of a stretch to think that trump was pondering whether the ( as yet unknown ) terrorists , having destroyed the two tallest buildings in lower manhattan , might be coming after the next - tallest . <PARA> but then again , the office building at 70 pine street is listed as being 25 feet taller than 40 wall street ( although it has four fewer floors ), so perhaps trump could be considered to have been “ bragging ” for claiming an honor that wasn ’ t actually his .

false	on 11 september 2016 , democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton made headlines for appearing unsteady on her feet before abruptly leaving a 9 / 11 memorial event ( a phenomenon later attributed to pneumonia ). <PARA> two hours later , clinton appeared outside daughter chelsea clinton ’ s apartment , sparking rumors ( along with a hashtag , # hillarysbodydouble ) that political impersonator teresa barnwell had “ filled in ” for the candidate in public later in the day to create a false appearance of renewed vigor . <PARA> the rumor took off on twitter alongside the aforementioned hashtag , with a number of details appended to the intriguing mystery . twitter users were confused by clinton ’ s seemingly vast medical improvement in the space of two hours and referenced a widely - circulated clip of a visibly recovered of the presidential candidate : <PARA> even before rumors began flying about barnwell filling in for clinton , commenters balked at an apparent lack of secret service agents visibly present and an atypical amount of space around the candidate : <PARA> among further evidence circulating on twitter was a screenshot from a post attributed to barnwell about a particularly intensive gig impersonating clinton for an event : <PARA> the referenced post was legitimate , but it was clear that barnwell had previously appeared as a political impressionist and not as part of any attempts to trick people into believing she was genuinely hillary clinton . <PARA> images circulating under the # hillarysbodydouble hashtag contrasted earlier shots of clinton with enhanced photographs of her second 11 september 2016 appearance : <PARA> users contrasted footage of clinton at the 9 / 11 event with photographs of clinton taken later in the day , not with images of barnwell specifically . barnwell shared a photograph of herself on 11 september 2016 : <PARA> although barnwell clearly kept busy impersonating clinton for entertainment purposes , her imperfect resemblance to the former secretary of state made the conspiracy theory less plausible . additionally , barnwell said that she was in los angeles that day , not new york city : <PARA> many speculated that a lack of secret service agents in view around the candidate was a clear indicator that the clinton spotted later that day was an impostor . however , if that unprotected “ hillary clinton ” were seriously wounded or killed by an assassin , it would be impossible for the real clinton to recover from the subterfuge and go on to win the 2016 election , so the risk of fallout from such a large cover - up would far outweigh the benefits of clinton ’ s faking a “ body double ” reappearance on 11 september 2016 . <PARA> it also doesn ’ t require a denial from teresa barnwell to determine she was not the woman depicted in the 11 september 2016 footage of clinton following her early exit from a 9 / 11 memorial event . whether clinton looked the same in the two photosets is a subjective assessment , but video and photographs of the subsequent appearance reveal a woman who is clearly not teresa barnwell . there is no way the two women could be confused for each other , given their clear facial dissimilarities .

false	on 28 august 2016 , comedian bill maher and filmmaker michael moore engaged in what was a fairly obvious humor bit on social media regarding the much discussed tax returns of donald trump . <PARA> as of late august 2016 , trump had not made his tax returns public , despite a decades - long tradition among politicians seeking office to do so . on 28 august 2016 , moore published a series of tweets and an instagram post while apparently attending a baseball game with maher : <PARA> moore also posted a variation of the story to facebook , alongside the same photograph of maher apparently emerging from a trump jet with a nondescript manila envelope in his hand : <PARA> the stunt received some media coverage ( as it involved two high - profile , politically involved entertainment figures ) most of which consistently framed it as a joke . however , within days , social media users began believing that the claim was meant to be straightforward . <PARA> neither moore nor maher explained the mechanics of the bit ( such as how they came to be on the steps of what looked like trump ’ s plane , or on a presumably secured laguardia runway ), further advancing the idea the claim was genuine . the likeliest explanation for the photographs was that maher and moore were in the process of boarding a private plane that happened to be adjacent to a trump jet , and maher was simply photographed holding a plain folder on and next to the craft ’ s steps . <PARA> no part of the tweets suggested that the stunt was anything but a humorous take on the absence of trump ’ s tax returns , and neither moore nor maher has referenced the bit in any way since the 28 august 2016 tweets were published ( as they certainly would have had they captured a major election year scoop ). even if the the scenario took place — presuming maher boarded a trump plane without permission with the intent of “ snatching ” private documents — there was no plausible reason that trump ’ s personal papers would be stored on the jet , or that an aircraft transporting a high - profile presidential candidate would be unsecured on a relatively public runway .

false	the apollo 11 mission has been fodder for conspiracy theorists ever since the lunar excursion module ( lem ) touched down on the moon ’ s surface on 20 july 1969 . we ’ ve already debunked several of the rumors holding that it ( and all of the subsequent nasa moon landing missions ) were elaborate hoaxes staged at terrestrial facilities , but in august 2016 we came across a new item that suggested proof of a faked moon landing could be found by examining the boots of astronaut neil armstrong , the first man to walk on the moon : <PARA> the photographs included in the graphic displayed above are both real : neil armstrong ’ s spacesuit is shown on the left , and his lunar footprints can be seen on the right . the photograph of neil armstrong ’ s apollo 11 spacesuit was taken in 2015 by astronomer phil plait , as the historic garment was being preserved by the smithsonian ’ s national air and space museum , and the apollo 11 astronauts photographed themselves and the lunar terrain ( including their footprints ) as they walked on the moon . <PARA> however , the footprint seen above wasn ’ t made by neil armstrong , but rather by fellow astronaut buzz aldrin , who accompanied armstrong to the moon . aldrin snapped that photograph of his own footprint to allow scientists to study the tensile strength of the lunar surface , and that photograph matches the tread on aldrin ’ s boot , as documented in a picture taken by armstrong as aldrin descended the ladder from the lem to the moon ’ s surface : <PARA> in any case , the tread on armstrong ’ s boots also matched the imprints seen in the lunar surface footprint photographs . while armstrong did wear the suit pictured above for much of the apollo 11 mission , he and aldrin donned a few extra pieces of gear before stepping onto the moon ’ s surface — including two large overshoes ( with treaded soles ): <PARA> photographs of the apollo 11 lunar landing clearly show armstrong wearing these overboots on the surface of the moon :

true	bridesmaids are female attendants who traditionally serve to ready the bride on her wedding day , plus in more modern times run various nuptial - related errands on her behalf in the months and weeks leading up to the big day . at one time they were chosen from among the unwed young women of marriageable age of the bride ’ s acquaintance , but these days neither age nor marital status bars a cherished friend or family member from serving in the bride ’ s retinue . <PARA> given that in earlier times the focus of the bridesmaid role was to supply the bride with a court of young , unwed lovelies , the saying “ always a bridesmaid but never a bride ” was a sad one , in that the bride , by virtue of having snagged a husband , was viewed at having succeeded at her life ’ s task whereas her attendants — no matter how lovely or accomplished — as having failed . a woman who had been a bridesmaid a number of times was someone whose marriage prospects were dim indeed , in that she had clearly been passed over by the eligible men of her acquaintance in favor of others . <PARA> ( according to lore , being a bridesmaid too often is unlucky for the marital prospects of that bridal helper . superstition has it that a gal who acts in this capacity three times dooms herself to perpetual spinsterhood . however , there is an out — go on to be a bridesmaid seven times and the curse is broken .) <PARA> given how vital making a good match was to the future of women ’ s lives in the not all too distant past , one would think the aphorism “ always a bridesmaid but never a bride ” has been with us forever . surprisingly , it dates to only the mid - 1920s . <PARA> songwriter fred leigh may have been the first to use the phrase in the sphere of popular culture , penning a music hall ditty titled “ why am i always the bridesmaid ?” that included the following chorus : <PARA> but the phrase entered the common parlance not through this musical tune , but through print advertisements run by listerine brand mouthwash beginning in 1925 that were titled “ often a bridesmaid but never a bride ” and featured a sad - faced yet fetching young woman . the text touting the use of listerine to combat bad breath began “ edna ’ s case was a really pathetic one . like every woman , her primary ambition was to marry . most of the girls of her set were married — or about to be . yet no one possessed more grace or charm or loveliness than she . and as her birthdays crept towards that tragic thirty - mark , marriage seemed farther from her life than ever . she was often a bridesmaid but never a bride .” <PARA> that early advertisement launched a saying that continues to carry on strongly into the 21st century . sports teams that habitually reach the playoffs but unfailingly fall short of seizing the championship are routinely dubbed “ bridesmaids ,” and one will hear members of such teams ruefully state “ always a bridesmaid but never a bride .” <PARA> listerine , by the way , did more than merely bestow upon the english language a lasting turn of phrase . prior to its being marketed as a breath freshener ( its earlier uses were to sterilize gauze bandages , clean floors , irrigate nasal passages , and the product was even touted as both baldness and gonorrhea cures ), folks weren ’ t overly concerned about their bad breath . only a series of listerine print ads ( including “ often a bridesmaid but never a bride ”) prompted consumers to buy mouth rinses to combat their halitosis .

minute mark , the narrator notes that the “ dead cops ” clip captured a small group of protesters who hung around after the end of the millions march in december 2014 and were disavowed by the organizers of that event , while video of the official millions march event shows that it was a peaceful protest : <PARA> the controversial clip was also misrepresented by some national news outlets as being a part of larger , mainstream protests : <PARA> a separate video published around the same time involved a clip of protesters that had been deliberately misreported ( or edited ) to suggest that a crowd chanting “ we won ’ t stop , we can ’ t stop , until killer cops are in cellblocks ” ( in reference to the freddie gray case ) was really saying “ we won ’ t stop , we can ’ t stop , so kill a cop ”: <PARA> the original video of new york protesters referenced at the beginning of this article was uploaded on 13 december 2014 by manhattan resident tom dilello , who maintained that he shot and uploaded the clip in the span of six minutes , leaving no time for him to edit the raw footage of the “ dead cops ” chant . a few weeks later , dilello spoke to buzzfeed about the then - viral video : <PARA> that outlet also consulted an audio expert about the clip ’ s authenticity : <PARA> on 23 december 2014 ( ten days after dilello shared the video , and three days after the nypd officers were ambushed ), the daily beast attempted to drill down on who was responsible for the chanting . their annotated article maintained that the new york chapter of the trayvon martin organizing committee ( tmoc ), who were unauthorized by the martin family to use trayvon ’ s name or likeness , were the sole faction of marchers using the chant . the daily beast highlighted the use of a unique protest banner to connect tmoc with the december 2014 footage : <PARA> such forensic reporting deemed the “ dead cops ” chant to be an aberration , one clearly “ smuggled in ” amid widespread peaceful protests involving tens of thousands of people ( versus an estimated 200 “ dead cops ” chanters who were not part of black lives matter ): <PARA> msnbc similarly performed some digging into what had become , in the aftermath of the nypd officers ’ shooting , a clip widely - shared as emblematic of protests occurring at that time : <PARA> msnbc reported that the millions march protests officially concluded at one police plaza at 6 : 30 pm , when the permit to demonstrate expired . the nighttime clip was clearly unrelated to it , and while commenters in 2016 lamented that the “ media won ’ t ” show the footage , it was clearly widely aired back in 2014 : <PARA> according to tom dilello the clip was shot an hour ’ s walk away from one police plaza , at 32nd street and fifth avenue . presumably marchers move more slowly than individual pedestrians , making the chanters again unlikely offshoots from the official march that concluded three miles downtown : <PARA> the clip in question involving chants about “ dead cops ” was shot in new york city in december 2014 , but contemporaneous reporting widely and incorrectly identified its source as black lives matter and millions march demonstrations taking place in different parts of the city at different times . after shootings claimed the lives of police officers in dallas and baton rouge in july 2016 , the clip resurfaced and was often mislabeled as occurring in one of those locations .

false	in june 2016 , rumors began circulating on social media reporting that the state of texas had declared that children whose parents believe the rapture is imminent are not subject to laws pertaining to compulsory education . one version of the rumor was published by the web site winning democrats : <PARA> the article was heavy on editorial content and light on facts , omitting the basic “ who , what , when ,” and “ where ” aspects of the story . however , an associated press article provided a far more detailed and nuanced account of the court ruling in question , which actually dealt with the issue of state laws requiring that home - schoolers meet basic educational goals without any imposing any requirement for testing to demonstrate those goals are being met : <PARA> the article identified the parents in question as laura and michael mcintyre , owners of a motorcycle dealership . the mcintyres have nine children , the article stated , and a family member reported them to the local school district because “ he never saw the children do much of anything educational ” and “ he also overheard one of the children tell a cousin ‘ they did not need to do schoolwork because they were going to be raptured .'” in essence , the legal debate was not about the family ’ s religious convictions , but rather about a relative ’ s complaint that their children were being insufficiently educated ( and the reason why they were being insufficiently educated was not relevant from a legal standpoint ). <PARA> according to the associated press , in response to the relative ’ s report , a school attendance officer attempted to determine whether the family was making sufficient effort to educate their children . in turn , the mcintyres filed suit , citing their 14th amendment rights ( unrelated to religion ), and alleging that the “ school district was anti - christian .” the family denied claims involving their belief in an impending rapture , asserting that a relative had fabricated the rapture element due to an unrelated business dispute : <PARA> the home school legal defense association ( hslda ) maintains a state - by - state list of regulations for homeschooling parents . summarized in a map , the list indicates that texas requires little to no regulation of homeschooling parents , irrespective of their religion ( or lack thereof ). an in - depth assessment [ pdf ] of the state ’ s laws from the perspective of that homeschooling advocacy group asserted that the sole requirements established in a 1987 court case were that “[ h ] omeschools must be conducted in a bona fide manner , using a written curriculum consisting of reading , spelling , grammar , math and a course in good citizenship ; no other requirements apply [.]” standardized testing requirements do not apply to homeschooled students in texas . <PARA> the texas education agency ’ s “ home schooling ” page reiterates the state ’ s relaxed stance on homeschooling : <PARA> although a copy of the ruling isn ’ t publicly available , news reports indicate that the court didn ’ t intervene to compel the mcintyre children to attend school or subject the family to additional scrutiny . but more to the point , the parents involved expressly did not argue that their belief in an imminent rapture exempted them from following state homeschooling laws . the parents instead refuted a relative ’ s claim regarding that religious belief , asserting that a complaint had been lodged against them in retaliation for a familial business dispute . irrespective of the family ’ s religious beliefs , texas homeschool regulations are among the least restrictive in the country and require little in the way of enforced curriculum or testing .	
false	on 24 june 2016 , a day after britain voted to leave the european union , a map appeared that purportedly showed that voters who voted to pass “ brexit ,” or “ british exit ,” all lived in areas affected by bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( mad cow disease ) during the 1992 outbreak : <PARA> if the graphic displayed above truly did show a map of brexit voters on the left and a map of the 1990s ’ mad cow outbreak on the right , the correlation would be difficult to deny . however , the real reason that these two maps look so similar is that they are actually the same map , with one in color and one in grayscale . the creator of this image took a real map showing brexit results , then altered the map ’ s key , date , and color before sharing it on social media to satirize the results of the referendum . <PARA> at the outbreak ’ s height , thousands of new cases of mad cow were being diagnosed every day throughout the united kingdom , the spread of which was eventually traced back to farmers giving calves feed made from animal bone and muscle tissue .

false	on 22 june 2016 john ashe , a former united nations diplomat from antigua , died at his dobbs ferry , new york , home . according to various accounts , ashe ’ s death occurred just five days before he was set to stand trial on corruption charges ; ashe ’ s cause of death was initially misreported as a heart attack , but subsequent news accounts attributed his demise to a weightlifting accident : <PARA> the day after reports of ashe ’ s passing hit the u . s . news cycle , a conspiracy site claimed that ashe had been slated to testify against hillary clinton on the day he conveniently ( that is to say , suspiciously ) passed away : <PARA> that claim stemmed from a single source : a blogger working under the nom de plume “ sorcha faal ” who publishes fabricated “ news ” accounts on the political conspiracy site whatdoesitmean . com . rationalwiki says of that blog and author : <PARA> prior fabrications from the same site and blogger held that president obama ordered the military to nuke the city of charleston , that rear admiral rick williams was fired because he revealed obama ’ s purchase of a mansion in dubai ( williams was actually terminated for misconduct ), and that vladimir putin and barack obama were locked in a potentially conflict - starting battle over the practices of the monsanto agribusiness corporation . the claim about clinton was also a variation on the long - circulating ( and equally false ) “ body bags ” rumor holding that the clintons have frequently “ done away ” with once - loyal associates who became political liabilities . <PARA> we contacted the u . s . district attorney for the southern district of new york to verify the claims about ashe and clinton . according to the individual with whom we spoke , cnn ’ s report that ashe ’ s corruption trial was set to begin just five days after his death was not accurate : ashe was only scheduled to attend some standard pre - trial meetings in the following days . <PARA> moreover , the u . s . district attorney ’ s spokesperson told us that no portion of ashe ’ s court case pertained to hillary clinton . not only was he not set to testify against clinton five days before he died , neither was he slated to do so at any point during the trial . a copy of the 5 october 2015 complaint against ashe and several co - defendants ( which involved ashe ’ s taking bribes from developer david ng to support one of ng ’ s real estate projects at the u . n .) can be located here [ pdf ].	
false	when democrat robert c . soles , jr . announced at the end of 2009 that he would not be seeking re - election to his office representing the 8th district in the north carolina senate , he stepped down as the longest - serving legislator in that state , having served in the north carolina house of representatives from 1969 to 1976 and from 1977 onwards in the senate . soles ’ decision not to run for re - election again may have been influenced by an august 2009 incident in which soles shot 22 - year - old kyle blackburn in the leg , claiming that he had fired in self - defense after blackburn and another young man trespassed on his property and attempted to kick in his door . in february 2010 , soles pled guilty to a misdemeanor assault with a deadly weapon charge : <PARA> however , commentaries on the shooting ( like the one reproduced above ) which portrayed senator soles as a hypocritical , virulently anti - gun legislator “ who has made a career of being against gun ownership for the general public ” are not supported by the evidence . according to project votesmart , the national rifle association political victory fund ( nra - pvf ), the nra political action committee that ranks political candidates based on voting records , public statements and their responses to nra - pvf questionnaires , had assigned the following grades to senator soles over the previous decade : <PARA> o 1998 — b <PARA> o 2000 — b + <PARA> o 2002 — b + <PARA> o 2004 — a <PARA> o 2006 — a <PARA> o 2008 — a <PARA> as well , grass roots north carolina ( grnc ), an “ organization dedicated to preserving individual rights , particularly your right to keep and bear arms ” said of the criticisms of senator soles :	
false	on 23 june 2016 , britain voted to leave the european union , a decision that has rocked europe and left its future uncertain . <PARA> while the brexit ( a portmanteau of “ british exit ”) vote had some immediate consequences — for example , the pound ’ s value plunged and markets dropped precipitously ; other countries ’ politicians called for similar referendums ; uk prime minister david cameron resigned — it will take time to see the full effects of britain ’ s decision . <PARA> one change that won ’ t happen , however , is the removal of a star from the european union flag . shortly after the brexit vote , people on social media started posting pictures of the eu flag with one star missing , as a critique or a commentary on the decision : <PARA> the commentary became confused with the reality ( as happens so often on social media ), with many people believing that a star actually would be removed from the european union ’ s flag . however , there are no plans to alter it , as the stars on the flag don ’ t actually represent the number of countries in the union : <PARA> the current design of the union ’ s flag dates back to 1955 , when it was first used by the council of europe , but it wasn ’ t adopted by the european economic community until 1985 . <PARA> the european union did have twelve members between 1986 and 1994 , but the number of member countries now tentatively sits at 28 ( and it will drop to 27 if and when britain officially leaves the european union ).	
false	on 10 june 2016 , comedian ellen degeneres sat down with reporters to discuss about her new movie , “ finding dory .” during the interview , degeneres addressed a rumor about the movie featuring a lesbian couple , saying that she didn ’ t know if the characters were gay . she then made a joke about a transgender stingray : <PARA> while degeneres ’ comment was made in jest ( laughter from the interviewer is audible in the clip ), several people missed the joke and claimed that pixar ’ s sequel to the 2003 movie “ finding nemo ” featured a transgender stingray : <PARA> rumors about the transgender stingray started circulating well before the movie was released , but no transgender characters actually showed up in the movie . reviewers criticized degeneres for joking about transgender people : <PARA> the stingrhonda character also doesn ’ t appear on the movie ’ s imdb page , lending further weight that the character was nothing more than a joke from degeneres .	
true	in june 2016 , word began spreading across social media that due to a class action settlement , many users were eligible for free tickets from ticketmaster . <PARA> many were wary due to the neverending hoax claims of free plane tickets , free disney vacations , and free gift cards were skeptical of the rumors . however , the legitimacy of the suit was eventually addressed by well - known media outlets : <PARA> it is true that there was a lot of confusion about the terms of the settlement and individual eligibility , leading to some disruptions on the site and clarifications on twitter : <PARA> a “ frequently asked questions ” item published on ticketmaster ’ s blog explained under which circumstances a customer might be eligible for free tickets : <PARA> a subsequent portion provided further details on vouchers and credits to which ticketmaster . com customers were possibly entitled : <PARA> however , another portion of the faq suggested that not all class members might ultimately receive vouchers : <PARA> a post on the music blog consequence of sound held that many users experienced initial difficulty redeeming or accessing their vouchers ( we attempted to verify eligibility of an october 2012 ticket purchased through ticketmaster . com , but did not find any “ active vouchers ” listed ): <PARA> news outlets also reported widespread technical difficulties among customers who initially verified eligibility , only to discover their codes missing ( purportedly on a temporary basis ): <PARA> in short , it is true that ticketmaster customers who made purchases through ticketmaster . com between october 1999 and february 2013 were eligible to receive concert passes or vouchers under the terms of a class action settlement . both ticketmaster and other outlets reported some glitches in the system , meaning that even some eligible class members might not immediately be able to access vouchers or passes .	
mixture	following the 12 june 2016 mass shooting at the pulse nightclub in orlando , florida , a popular item circulated via facebook countered widespread reporting about the gunman ( and his possible ties to radical islam ) by focusing on the fact that is was a muslim man who had saved many lives at the scene of the shooting : <PARA> however , a number of contemporaneous news articles did in fact cover the story of former u . s . marine imran yousuf and his actions during the mass shooting . marine corps times , for example , profiled yousuf ( an “ engineer equipment electrical systems technician in the marine corps from june 2010 to may 2016 ... deployed to afghanistan in 2011 ”), who was working as a bouncer at pulse at the time of the shooting incident : <PARA> a 13 june 2016 facebook post published by yousuf ( who expressed regret that he couldn ’ t save more lives during the shooting ) read as follows : <PARA> although it was widely claimed in social media posts that yousuf is a muslim , news articles described him as hindu ( not muslim ): <PARA> the hindu also correctly noted yousuf is a hindu of indian descent : <PARA> it ’ s true imran yousuf served in the u . s . marines and has been widely hailed for saving as many as 70 clubgoers during the orlando shooting , but the aspect of his story that has most intrigued many viewers is not true : yousuf is hindu , not muslim .	
false	in the chaotic aftermath of the 12 june 2016 orlando pulse nightclub shooting , a number of rumors and inaccuracies swept across social media . among them was the claim that a new syndicate including the atlanta sun times ( not the chicago sun - times ) had reported news of the massacre several hours “ too early ”: <PARA> the item went on to claim that google had also displayed the timestamp : <PARA> as the post indicated , google automatically populates information from web sites , so it holds that if atlanta sun times incorrectly dated the page , google would also display that incorrect information . we checked the source code of the page and indeed , the item was listed as published several hours prior to the attack — in one portion of the code : <PARA> however , that wasn ’ t universally true . while the aggregation of the atlanta sun times ‘ report was incorrectly timestamped , the original content was clearly not : <PARA> the mismatch in timestamps suggested a technical error of some sort , so we contacted the atlanta sun times to ask whether the variation was a glitch or something else . an employee explained to us how the aggregated article ( since corrected ) ended up misdated : <PARA> the orlando shooting was not the first time superstation95 used a major tragedy to sow additional fear and confusion ( which then turn into lucrative pageviews for the site ’ s owner ). superstation95 is a web site that is neither a “ superstation ” nor a legitimate news source , but rather a dumping grounds of misinformation from hal turner , a white supremacist who spent 33 months in prison for making death threats against three federal judges in 2009 . ( the name listed on the site ’ s “ contact ” page is turner ’ s lawyer .) <PARA> beginning in late 2015 , superstation95 began spreading alarmist hoaxes and conspiracy theories on social media , often building upon legitimate tragic or frightening events with embellished ( and frightening ) details . among the most widely spread were claims that a large group of muslim men fired upon campers and hikers in california , fukushima radiation caused severe mutations in marine life , cargo ships mysteriously ground to a halt signaling imminent economic catastrophe , a deadly las vegas strip car crash involved a driver shouting “ allahu akbar ,” the san bernardino shooting occurred because the shooter was offended by pork served at a holiday party shortly before the massacre , the earth ’ s “ magnetosphere ” collapsed for two hours , and a ( nonexistent ) suicide note left by a genuinely deceased ice agent warned of impending fema camps and mass enslavement . none of superstation95 ‘ s tragedy - milking predictions have ever come to fruition .	
false	in june 2016 , a purported quote from former president jimmy carter concerning the possible election of the united states ’ first woman president began circulating online : <PARA> we ’ ve found no documentation showing that the former president said this , however , and no record of this statement ( attached to jimmy carter ’ s name or otherwise ) showing up prior to june 2016 , when it was posted on an internet forum regarding hillary clinton and election fraud . <PARA> although the post included links to dozens of sources in an attempt to prove that clinton had committed election fraud , it provided no citation for the quote attributed to carter . given that this “ quote ” originated on a thread dedicated to showing why hillary clinton should not be elected president of the united states , and that no reputable publication had ever linked carter to this phrase prior to its publication on this forum , it ’ s probable jimmy carter never said it .

unproven	a photograph purporting to show a muslim woman sitting while the united states national anthem being played is frequently shared on social media along with disparaging and hateful remarks about muslims and immigrants : <PARA> the image has also been used by several far - right web sites ( such as mad world news ) in articles aimed to denigrate the muslim population . these articles labeled the photograph “ disturbing ,” called the woman ’ s actions “ disgusting ,” and derided the thought of changing america ’ s customs once again to appease muslims : <PARA> the photograph displayed above started circulating online after it was posted to facebook by lacey zarnetski hill on 22 february 2016 . while hill ’ s post has since been deleted , the message was documented on a motocross forum : <PARA> while hill ’ s message provided a few details that were typically absent from subsequent social media postings , such as the location of the event ( an ama supercross rally in dallas , texas ) other details remain unclear . for instance , hill wrote that the pictured woman sat during a “ great tribute of respect to our flag .” while this could mean the national anthem , what it might be isn ’ t explicitly stated in the original facebook message . <PARA> while this image is frequently shared along with messages criticizing the seated woman for disrespecting america , and while hill writes that “ every person stood and removed their hats in honor ,” the image clearly shows at least one other person “ disrespecting ” the united states by wearing a hat . ( it could also be argued that taking a photo during a “ great tribute of respect to our flag ” is just as disrespectful as remaining seated .) <PARA> this photograph shows a brief moment in time , and it ’ s impossible to know why the woman was sitting while the rest of the crowd stood . while many assumed that this woman was purposefully disrespecting the united states by sitting during a display of patriotism , there ’ s no evidence to support that assumption . perhaps the woman was entertaining an upset child , was momentarily fishing for something in her purse , was unable to stand , or stood moments after this photograph was taken . <PARA> while the original facebook message was deleted after the comment section filled with hateful rhetoric , hill did offer some final thoughts on the image :	
false	an image showing a suspiciously large tortoise has been circulating on the internet since at least 2006 . while the same photograph has been attached to a wide variety of claims , the most popular backstory asserts that this photograph shows a 529 - year - old tortoise that was caught in the amazon river : <PARA> unsurprisingly , there are several problems with this claim , starting with the fact that tortoises don ’ t live for 500 years . national geographic has noted that the giant tortoises of the galápagos islands are the longest - lived of all the vertebrates , but even these animals only live for about 100 years on average . “ jonathan ,” a seychelles giant tortoise thought to be the oldest land vertebrate in the world , was reportedly born around 1832 . <PARA> giant tortoises also don ’ t keep getting larger as they get older , so even if this animal actually existed and had lived for more than 500 years , it would remain around the same size for most of that time . however , if it actually did measure 59 feet , it would weigh much more than 800 pounds : galápagos tortoises can exceed five feet in length ( 1 . 5 meters ) and reach 550 pounds , or a little more than a hundred pounds a foot . <PARA> of course , the biggest blow to the claim that this image shows “ the world ’ s largest tortoise ,” is that the object pictured above is actually a prop from the 2006 film gamera the brave , not a living creature . an article published by scifi japan in march 2006 reported that the model of gamera was about 15 feet long ( not 59 feet ):	
false	on 4 june 2016 , the beaverton web site published an article reporting that the band tragically hip had cancelled their upcoming tour after group members were unable to secure tickets to their own shows : <PARA> in addition to pondering the absurd premise of the article ( a band ’ s needing to buy tickets to attend their own concerts ), readers could have deduced the story was a spoof of the entertainment ticket industry by reading the beaverton ' s disclaimer : <PARA> while tragically hip has not cancelled their upcoming tour , fans ( other than actual band members ) have indeed had a hard time getting tickets to the group ’ s shows . the huffington post reported that the tour sold out in minutes , forcing fans to pay exorbitant prices to scalpers to have a chance of seeing one of the band ’ s final shows :	
false	a quote that ’ s commonly credited to theodore roosevelt on the difference between conservatives and liberals is often shared in meme form ( like many unproven or out of context quotes ) to bolster specific political opinions on social media . the quote , usually accompanied by a photograph of the former president looking into the middle distance , states : “ to anger a conservative , lie to him . to anger a liberal , tell him the truth .” <PARA> however , although dozens of sites have attributed this phrase to the former president , none has been able to provide any information about where and when roosevelt supposedly made this remark . the quote displayed above has been in circulation since at least 2004 , when it was shared in the signature of someone ( not roosevelt ) posting on an online forum . <PARA> the phrase may also stem from a lengthy chain e - mail that circulated via “ airmail ” in 1999 : <PARA> it seems in this case that — as with other quotes — someone took a pithy saying from a chain e - mail and attached a famous name and photograph to it to lend it more credence . <PARA> honest abe warned us this would happen :	
false	on 28 may 2016 the facebook page “ i ’ m white ” shared the meme reproduced above . it featured a photograph of a young , blonde woman , and the text said : <PARA> the caption on the status updated claimed the purported incident occurred in sweden : <PARA> the photograph did not show a crime victim , however . it was published to flickr on 5 november 2011 , with a caption asking for votes in a contest ( translated ): <PARA> according to the caption superimposed on the photograph , the 14 - year - old swedish girl was abducted and raped in 2015 . police purportedly blamed the girl for the incident , and the three assailants received no jail time . social media users asked about the specifics of the claim , but no one produced any news links about an incident matching the description . <PARA> there was , however , a story that came out in late 2015 that ’ s very similar to the one in the meme : a thirteen - year - old girl disappeared from her home in berlin for a day and a half , then reappeared saying she had been held captive and repeatedly raped by three men ( described in separate news accounts only as “ migrants ,” “ asylum seekers ,” and “ southern - looking “), and detailing her escape . a woman purporting to be her aunt gave a detailed and tearful account of the ordeal , and another woman claiming to be the girl ’ s cousin spoke at length about it at a far - right political rally . <PARA> the account was by turns tragic and moving . there was just one problem with the story : it was completely made up . the girl admitted her hoax just a few days after her return during the investigation , and subsequent examinations showed no signs of trauma . <PARA> the meme also may have been inspired in part by a 26 may 2016 article published by british tabloid express , which reported that police in sweden investigated an uptick in sexual assaults carried out by “ asylum seekers ”, who then pinned blame on their teenaged victims : <PARA> the article referenced a may 2016 report from the swedish police authority [ pdf ], which examined sexual assaults in the country between 2011 and 2016 . the first page mentioned refugees in passing ( and cited rumors of new year ’ s eve assaults ), but not as a massive component of sex assaults in sweden ( translated ): <PARA> the report concluded by acknowledging that the issue of sexual assaults in sweden is a complex , and needs a more dynamic law enforcement approach : <PARA> although a handful of news stories included elements of the meme ’ s claims , none specifically involved a 14 - year - old swedish girl abducted and gang - raped for hours by refugees before she escaped . it is possible that the meme misrepresented a case we were unable to locate , but it ’ s probably that — like the photograph — the claim is a creative illustration of its creator ’ s fear of refugees in europe .

false	in may 2016 , an image purportedly showing a group of “ trump haters ” waving foreign flags and a group of “ trump supporters ” waving american flags appeared on social media , mostly shared by several pro - donald trump groups . but at least one of the images provided in the meme is completely unrelated to the republican presidential candidate . <PARA> the image of “ trump supporters ” waving american flags was actually taken in 2011 ( long before trump started his 2016 presidential campaign ) as tennesseans gathered to protect the funeral of sergeant kevin balduf from a westboro baptist church protest : <PARA> the image showing “ trump haters ” was taken on 27 may 2016 at a trump protest in san diego , california . the image appeared on the web site fire andrea mitchell under the title “ leftist thugs protest trump in san diego , can you find an american flag ?” the web site then provided three images of the protest in which no american flags were supposedly visible . <PARA> if the captioner had looked a little harder , however , they might have found several images from that same san diego protest in which those protesting trump ’ s appearance were captured waving american flags :

9 / 11 recovery , but he appeared not to be aware of the specifics of the media ’ s charge against him : <PARA> another version of the claim was published by the web site addicting info , holding that trump ’ s property at 40 wall street didn ’ t meet federal criteria for what constituted a small business entitled to financial relief doled out to affected businesses . the outlet asserted trump had “ swindled ” the empire state development corporation out of funds to which he was not entitled . that web site also misrepresented the financial aid as funds designated solely for the repair of damaged buildings : <PARA> however , back in 2006 the daily news not only suggested trump was technically entitled to federal aid under the established guidelines , but they also reported that many other subsidiaries of large businesses had similarly qualified for and received federal aid from the same program by meeting the empire state development corp .’ s definition of what constituted a “ small business ”: <PARA> at the time of the controversy , trump was not the sole business entity named by the paper . the daily news explained in detail that the esdc used number of employees as a qualifying benchmark with respect to the disbursed funds , not annual revenues or additional ownership of businesses . in the chaotic wake of 9 / 11 , it was not uncommon for relief agencies and the government to adopt a simpler standard of categorization in order to allocate money with alacrity to victims in need , or to stave off damage to the economy in the weeks , months , and years to come . <PARA> that original report named several large businesses entitled to relief funds under the standard applied by the esdc , trump among them . the paper noted that those entities often reported yearly profits far exceeding the relatively minor funds received under the 9 / 11 small business aid initiative and decried what was painted as a loophole under which a significant portion of the funds allocated were distributed to larger companies with relatively small presences in the downtown manhattan area affected by the tragedy : <PARA> the daily news was neither the sole source of information on the grants provided to businesses after the attacks , nor the most neutral . a september 2005 report [ pdf ] on the economic recovery initiatives undertaken after the event clearly and concisely explained the scope business loans and grants available to affected businesses under the business recovery grant program , which was not specifically described as being for small businesses only ( save for the 500 - employee threshold ). moreover , the qualifying zone included any business operating on or below 14th street , an area so large that the majority of eligible businesses would not have been “ damaged ” in the attack in a structural sense : <PARA> the attack ad from which allegations resurfaced placed focus on trump ’ s 2001 statement that none of his properties were damaged in the event , suggesting that his access to grants was improper . that implication was misleading , as recovery programs focused on the broader effects of the attacks on businesses , since even businesses that didn ’ t sustain physical damage did not escape financial damage due to the months - long excavation of the site , ongoing disruption of widely relied upon public transportation services , and other factors that gravely affected all businesses located in the surrounding area : <PARA> the brg ’ s documentation [ pdf ] expressly contradicted the daily news ‘ assertion that the funds were somehow only intended for small businesses , and that large ones nonetheless managed to get their hands on chump change they neither needed nor were entitled to under the law . another concise explanation of the recovery program explicitly stated that the funds were for small and large firms alike , with a clear goal of preventing their exodus from a then -

false	a meme featuring several images of donald trump posing with prominent african - americans was widely circulated on facebook in may 2016 , along with the claim that the real estate mogul was “ never once accused of being racist by anyone ” until he entered the 2016 presidential campaign as a republican — implying that trump was falsely being accused of racism by opponents purely for the purpose of scoring political points : <PARA> however , donald trump was accused of racism long before he announced that he was running for president . according to the new york times , one of trump ’ s first newspaper appearances was in 1973 , when the trump management corporation was sued by the department of justice and charged for violating the fair housing act of 1968 : <PARA> trump was also accused of racism in 1989 , when he took out full page ads calling for the return of the death penalty in several new york city newspapers . the ads were published a few weeks after a 28 - year - old woman was raped while jogging in central park . five men were arrested for the attack : <PARA> the incident stirred racial tensions in the city , with many accusing trump of adding fuel to the fire . when evidence surfaced in 2002 that would eventually lead to the exoneration of the five men who were charged with rape , protesters criticized trump for his racially charged rhetoric : <PARA> former employees of donald trump also accused the real estate mogul of racism back in the 1990s . john r . o ’ donnell , the one - time president of trump plaza hotel & casino , wrote in his 1991 book trumped ! that his former employer frequently used racial slurs : <PARA> the real estate mogul was also accused of making racist remarks when he testified before the house native american affairs subcommittee in 1993 : <PARA> in 1992 , trump lost an appeal to overturn a $ 200 , 000 penalty for removing black dealers from gaming tables at the request of high rollers , and in 1996 twenty african - americans in indiana sued trump , accusing him of reneging on a promise that he would hire largely minorities for his riverboat casino staff . <PARA> this isn ’ t a comprehensive list of all the times donald trump has been tied to racially charged incidents , nor is it proof that donald trump currently harbors racist ideals . the viral meme which circulated in may 2016 claimed that trump had never been accused of racism before he decided to run against democrats , and that claim is blatantly false . trump has been accused of racism by former employees , protesters , committee members , and he has also been the subject of legal action involving anti - discrimination laws .	
mixture	in early may 2016 , a number of alarmist blog posts reported that president obama had issued a “ kill order ” allowing more than 4 , 000 bald eagles to be slaughtered each year for the next 30 years . a popular version published by liberty writers was heavy - handed with symbolism , maintaining that president obama “ really hates ” bald eagles : <PARA> the basis of this claim was something rather different than what sites such as liberty writers were reporting , however . as an abc news article of 4 may 2016 noted , what has been widely described as a “ kill order ” for bald eagles is actually revisions to existing wind - energy guidelines that , in part , pertain to accidental bald and golden eagle deaths involving wind turbines . according to the revised guidelines , the time permit of limits granted to wind power companies would be extended from five to 30 years ( with renewals still required every five years ), and the number of eagles that could permissibly ( i . e ., without financial penalty ) be killed or injured each year by wind power companies would be increased . however , wind power companies would be required to take steps to minimize such losses and would have to take additional measures if they exceeded the stated limits or substantially affected bald or gold eagle populations : <PARA> the change in regulations doesn ’ t mean that power companies are suddenly going to be setting their wind turbines to “ eagle kill ” mode and bagging the limit of 4 , 200 bald eagles per year , however . a 2013 article published in the peer - reviewed journal of raptor research found that “ concerns over the effects of [ turbine - related deaths ] on north america ’ s bald eagles and golden eagles exist , but are weakly substantiated due to a lack of published documentation of mortalities .” that study aimed to “ summarize documented cases of eagle mortality at wind energy facilities in the contiguous united states ” for the 15 - year period prior to its publication . <PARA> between 1997 and june 2012 , researchers identified 85 combined bald eagle and golden eagle fatalities attributed to wind turbines , or roughly 5 . 6 deaths per year in the entirety of the contiguous united states . moreover , of those 85 total eagle deaths in a 15 - year period , only six were bald eagles . the remaining 79 deceased birds were golden eagles . those findings were illustrated in a state - by - state table : <PARA> additionally , conservationists asserted that the risk posed to eagles by wind turbines was far less than the risk created by the effect of climate change on the birds ’ habitats : <PARA> so revisions to wind power guidelines allow for the possibility that wind power companies could kill more bald and golden eagles without penalty ( up to 4 , 200 ) than they have in the past . however , there is little evidence that many eagles have been killed or injured under the existing rules , and the revisions are balanced by requirements that wind power companies implement more stringent safeguards to protect such animals , such as enabling the collection of valuable information about eagles , and helping to foster sources of energy ( such as wind power ) that do not threaten eagles through the degradation of their existing habitats .

true	news stories abound of airline passengers traveling with all sorts of unusual animals under the premise that their non - human companions provide necessary emotional support , such as this one about a bereaved widow who flew with her turkey to san francisco , where she would be spreading her late husband ’ s ashes : <PARA> while service animals such as seeing - eye dogs have a long history and are familiar to nearly everyone , emotional support animals are a much newer phenomenon . established law provides for the accommodation of service animals and emotional support animals in housing and other public facilities , but headlines start rolling off the presses when the human half of the pair attempts to travel on an airplane with a non - standard species such as a miniature horse , pig , or monkey . <PARA> pot - bellied pigs are often favored as emotional support animals by those who are allergic to dogs . however , pigs don ’ t always travel well , as illustrated in several news stories of recent years : in november 2014 , for instance , a woman was escorted off of a usa airways flight in connecticut because her 70 - pound pot - bellied pig was squealing uncontrollably , “ three times louder than a child ,” and defecated in the airplane aisle . <PARA> in a 2001 incident ( again on a usa airways flight ), the passenger informed the airline that her pig was “ about a hundred pounds ,” but staff were taken aback when the pig arrived and it proved to be closer to 300 pounds . the two women ( the pig - owner was traveling with a friend ) were assigned bulkhead seats in first class to provide as much space as possible , but they were still forced to plant their feet on the bulkhead for the duration of the six - hour flight to allow adequate space for their porcine companion . although the pig was calm during the flight , it became frantic upon deplaning , squealing , urinating , and defecating in the close confines of the galley in a frenzied effort to get off the airplane after landing . <PARA> in may 2003 , blind passenger dan shaw traveled from boston to chicago with his seeing - eye miniature horse , cuddles , to appear on an episode of oprah winfrey ’ s talk show . shaw chose a miniature horse instead of a dog for his guide animal because horses have much longer lifespans than dogs , and he was afraid of getting emotionally attached to a dog who might have a relatively short life . shaw purchased a first - class ticket for his horse because , at two feet high and 70 pounds in weight , cuddles wouldn ’ t have fit under the seat in front of him in coach . although american airlines staff initially debated requiring that cuddles wear a diaper , they relented when they were assured that cuddles was housebroken and decided to forego the diaper requirement for the two - hour flight . that turned out to be an unfortunate decision , because cuddles defecated on the carpet in front of the bulkhead . the fact that the flight ’ s take - off was delayed 45 minutes may have contributed to cuddles ’ discomfort . <PARA> we didn ’ t find any instances of service monkeys being involved in disruptive incidents aboard airplanes , but perhaps that is because most service monkeys are six to ten pound capuchins who can fit in a carrier under the seat in front of the passenger , just as more typical pets do . <PARA> with incidents like these appearing in the news , and consumers experiencing the ever - closer confines of coach seating , air travel with unusual animals immediately grabs the public ’ s attention . in particular , air passengers have taken umbrage at other flyers who are seemingly trying to “ game the system ” and declare their household pets to be emotional support animals to get their animals on - board for free . <PARA> in 1986 , congress passed the air carrier access act , a law intended ( in part ) to ensure that service animals would be allowed to fly on planes and could not be booted off simply because other passengers object to their presence . service animals must be under the control of their owners ( physically by a leash or cage , or verbally through commands ), cannot roam around the cabin , and — contrary to the accidents described in the news stories mentioned above — must be trained not to eliminate on airplanes . for flights of longer than eight hours , the owners must provide written plans for clean disposal of waste . <PARA> although the emergency exit rows with their expanded legroom might seem like a logical place to put a dog or other service animal , those rows must be kept clear at all times for emergencies , so service animals usually end up in the bulkhead rows if they are too large to fit under a seat . monkeys are the only species permitted by the faa to travel on a seat instead of the floor ( although we ’ ve read of celebrities purchasing first - class seats for their pet pooches ). <PARA> airlines , thankfully , are allowed to prohibit passage to unusual service animals such as snakes , rodents , ferrets , and spiders . they can also prohibit farm poultry , but easter — the widow ’ s turkey mentioned at the beginning of this article — had been classified as a domesticated bird by delta airlines and was thus allowed to fly . ( it should be noted that easter flew without incident : he wore a diaper and reportedly “ didn ’ t make a sound .”) <PARA> there ’ s a legal distinction between service animals and emotional support animals . service animals , usually dogs , are individually trained to assist their owners with disabilities . these include the well - known seeing eye dogs , hearing dogs , psychiatric service dogs , seizure response dogs , and dogs who are trained to perform such tasks as pulling a wheelchair , picking up items that have been dropped , reminding a person to take medication , alerting their person to a sound , and so on . service animals also occasionally include miniature horses such as cuddles . <PARA> emotional support animals ( esa ), also known as comfort animals , are supposed to be used as part of an emotional therapeutic treatment plan . they do not have specific training to provide tasks on behalf of their humans and are not considered service animals under the american disabilities act . they may provide companionship , relieve loneliness , and sometimes help with depression , anxiety , or other phobias . there is no national standardized certification to document the qualifications of an emotional support animal . <PARA> some pet owners have been accused of falsely claiming that their household pet is an emotional support animal to travel for free ( since the air carrier access act prohibits the airlines from charging a fee for such animals ) or to get around the limitations that airlines typically impose on the number of pets allowed to travel per cabin . <PARA> legally , getting an esa on an airplane requires documentation from a mental health provider verifying the emotional benefit of the animal . the letter should be less than one year old , prescribe or endorse the animal as an esa offering benefits for a particular mental disability , and the emotional / mental diagnosis must comply with the current edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders ( dsm - v ). in practice , however , it is not difficult to find mental health providers who will provide supportive letters . <PARA> in addition , numerous websites exist that promise to “ certify ” an owner ’ s pet as an emotional support animal , charging between $ 59 and $ 200 to provide the owner with an id vest and a certificate — and sometimes the necessary mental health letters as well . while researching this story , we easily found websites that promised “ any dog may qualify ,” “ take your pet everywhere . instant approval !”, and “ it ’ s easy to register your pet as an emotional support animal !” <PARA> two today investigative writers discovered first - hand the ease with which they could travel with their animals . jeff rossen filled out a questionnaire on a esa web site and was sent an official letter from a mental health professional without ever seeing or speaking to her . he subsequently took two flights with his dog sitting in his lap , and no one from the airlines even asked to see the letter . his colleague , lindsey bomnin , received certification from the same web site for a borrowed pot - bellied pig , then took two flights with the pig on her lap . <PARA> although obtaining certification for a household pet may seem like a nifty way of avoiding the airlines ’ pet fares — or sticking it to an industry which seems to find ever - more - numerous ways of nickel - and - diming their customers — faking a disability ultimately ends up hurting those who really do need their emotional support animals . in addition , claiming that a large and unruly animal is an esa ( like that 300 - pound pig ) presents a true safety hazard to passengers and crew alike if the animal panics or goes on a rampage . <PARA> this claim has been rated “ mostly true ” because although passengers with emotional disabilities can travel with dogs or other support animals such as monkeys , miniature horses , or pigs , they are required to provide documentation from a mental health professional in order to do so ( even if sometimes airlines accept nothing more than a simple verbal claim in allowing passage for a pet ). to avoid the wild west atmosphere of on - line certification and unruly animals being brought aboard , it seems that a national and standardized system of certification would be beneficial for all involved .	
false	on 20 april 2016 , the facebook page the common sense conservative published an image macro identifying african - american abolitionist harriet tubman as a “ gun - toting , democrat - shooting ” republican : <PARA> the text included in the macro was vaguely rooted in truth : tubman reportedly carried a gun during her trips on the underground railroad . but it ’ s unlikely she was using a gun to “ shoot democrats ” ( other than in the vague sense that if someone threatened her efforts to the point of requiring an armed response , that opponent was probably more likely to be a democrat than a republican given the alignments of the major political parties at the time ). <PARA> according to a pbs biography of the abolitionist , tubman used her gun to threaten the fugitives who grew tired or afraid on their journey to the north ( people who were unlikely to be democrats , given that slaves weren ’ t able to vote at all , and runaway slaves certainly wouldn ’ t have been democratic party members even if they could ): <PARA> the assertion that tubman was a republican is also something of a stretch . while tubman fought against slavery and political oppression and thus would have been more politically aligned with the republican party platform , she couldn ’ t actually vote ( since women ’ s suffrage legislation had been passed in only a few states prior to her death ). <PARA> regardless , the biggest piece of misinformation included in this image macro is the photograph . the woman pictured is not abolitionist harriet tubman but rather mary fields , also known as stagecoach mary , the first african - american mail carrier employed by the united states post office : <PARA> this item was published amidst a steady stream of backlash regarding the announcement that an portrait of tubman would be replacing that of andrew jackson on the front of the u . s . $ 20 bill .

false	on 20 april 2016 , u . s . treasury secretary jacob j . lew announced that that a portrait of african - american abolitionist harriet tubman would replace that president andrew jackson on the front of the u . s . $ 20 bill . not long after that announcement was made , the facebook page “ american news ” shared a post claiming that plans were afoot to add president barack obama to mount rushmore : <PARA> those who clicked through to the post might have noticed it was dated 19 november 2014 , and barely of relevance even back then . even though the headline proclaimed that president obama was being “ considered ” as an addition to the mount rushmore monument , the body of the article noted that such consideration was nothing more than one person ’ s “ ridiculous ” position : <PARA> as the scant reporting revealed , no plans were truly afoot to add president obama ’ s likeness to mount rushmore ( either in 2014 or 2016 ). the entire premise of the item was based on a statement purportedly made by former white house deputy chief of staff jim messina ( misspelled as “ messian ”) which had nothing to do with mount rushmore . no source was provided for messina ’ s commentary , and it wasn ’ t even clear that he mentioned the monument in his lauding of president obama . <PARA> even if messina had supported such a change , one man ’ s spoken opinion was in no way tantamount to an actual effort to add president obama to mount rushmore . american news routinely renders outdated , misleading , or otherwise inaccurate material as clickbait headlines . among their previous misleading or outright false items were claims that texans were being forced to pay reparations for slavery , that canada banned beyonce over her super bowl 2016 performance , that president obama personally prohibited a navy admiral from distributing bibles , that fema opened its “ first ” concentration camp in arizona , that sadie robertson was gravely injured in a serious car accident , that americans were seriously debating the merits of “ post - birth abortion ,” and that president obama had admitted to forging his birth certificate .	
false	on 19 april 2016 , social media users began sharing links to what appeared to be a huffington post article titled “ the fix is in : sanders supporters in new york see votes switched to hillary ,” which reported that persons casting ballots for bernie sanders in the new york state democratic primary election were seeing their votes recorded for rival candidate hillary clinton : <PARA> the hoax article appears to legitimately originate with the huffington post : <PARA> however , closer inspection showed that the article in question did not originate with the leigitmate huffington post web site ; rather , it was a hoax published by an impostor site that mimicked huffpo ’ s familiar look : <PARA> additionally , a tiny gray hyperlink titled “ disclaimer ” at the very bottom of article led to a page that acknowledged the site ’ s counterfeit nature and identified the site ’ s content as “ fiction ”: <PARA> this report was aggregated by the similarly unreliable web site united media publishing , which cited the counterfeit huffington post site as a source . <PARA> this hoaxc article popped up as new york ’ s primary was already riddled with confusion . a lawsuit was filed on behalf of voters claiming they were disenfranchised from participating in the election , and , according to reports , approximately 125 , 000 democratic <PARA> voters were “ purged ” in kings county alone .	
false	new york ’ s 2016 primary election was rife with rumors , due in part because new york ’ s primaries are closed , and also because an early change - of - party deadline had already created a good deal of confusion in an already complicated system . one claim that emerged from the rumors warned bernie sanders voters not to wear shirts or hats with his name on them to polling places : <PARA> it is true that new york state voting laws contain a provision concerning “ passive electioneering “, and rumors about voter suppression due to such laws circulated in 2008 as well . however , there is no reason that enforcement of it would affect only those who were casting ballots for any particular candidate . <PARA> at the same time , new york state ’ s board of elections was inundated with calls from worried voters about being turned away on a technicality . in a 2008 article , spokesman bob brehm was one of several parties who spoke to the huffington post about rumors concerning that law : <PARA> by law , no form of electioneering ( passive or otherwise ) can occur within 100 feet of a polling place : <PARA> we contacted the suffolk county board of elections to ask whether voters would be denied the right to participate in the state ’ s primary if they wore a shirt supporting any particular candidate . they told us that in a worst - case scenario , the voter would be asked to turn the shirt inside out , but would still be able to vote without interruption otherwise . <PARA> we asked about another rumor , specifically whether it was true that in some districts , polls would be opening at noon rather than 6 in the morning ( which would prevent many from casting ballots before work ). the board of elections worker said that the rumor was false for all of long island , and that all polling places in nassau and suffolk counties were opening at 6am . <PARA> it is true , however , that polling hours are shorter for primaries than general elections in some regions of the state : <PARA> despite rumors to the contrary , the shorter hours were not a new attempt at suppressing votes . this particular primary election clause has been in place in new york state for decades [ pdf ]: <PARA> according to that law , the noon provision was in effect as early as 1976 . a challenge to the law in 1982 was initially successful , but overturned on appeal . <PARA> there were grains of truth to the rumors circulating among voters ahead of new york ’ s primaries . voters were not allowed to engage in “ passive electioneering ” via shirts , hats , or buttons within 100 feet of a polling place on election day . however , no one would lose the right to vote , and the law was typically described as “ rarely enforced .” a voter might be asked to turn their shirt inside out or leave a hat in the car , but would not be denied at the voting booth . also , it was false that any counties had primary hours cut ; the law dictating a shorter voting window throughout the state of new york was in effect before 1982 , and had nothing to do with the 2016 primaries .	
false	on 16 april 2016 , the web site world news daily report published an article reporting that police in north carolina had tased and “ brutally ejected ” a woman from a ladies ’ restroom because they thought she was transgender : <PARA> despite its reference to a topical controversy , this item was nothing more than another fabrication from world news daily report ( wndr ), a clickbait web site that traffics in fake news stories . wndr ’ s disclaimer notes that all of the site ’ s articles are “ entirely fictional ” and that any resemblance to the truth in them is “ purely a miracle ”: <PARA> the image used by wndr for this article also did not depict a transgender woman arrested in april 2016 . the photograph was actually taken in 2012 and captures mary lee bradford and mary jamis as they were arrested at the country register of deeds office in winston - salem , north carolina , while protesting that state ’ s ban on same - sex marriage :

mixture	in april 2016 , a message circulated on facebook affirming that car seat headrests were deliberately designed to be detachable and sturdy so that they could be used to break car windows in emergencies : <PARA> this “ survival tip ” has been around for several years and has been featured in a number of survival blogs , but it gained widespread popularity in 2012 when it was featured on a japanese game show : <PARA> while it is possible to break a car window with a removable headrest , this is an incidental application of that object rather than a deliberate one . the primary intended function of the modern car headrest was to prevent whiplash in case of accident : when benjamin katz filed a patent for an automobile headrest in 1921 , he noted that the device could stabilize the head when it was subjected to the “ jolts and irregular movements ” inherent in driving an automobile . the car headrest has since gone through many changes , but these primarily focus on safety , comfort , and manufacturing , not emergency uses . <PARA> regulations from the national highway traffic safety administration regarding head restraints also focus on reducing or preventing whiplash , not breaking windows . a nhtsa and department of transportation ruling in 2004 revisited the standards , specifically addressing “ maximum gap allowance and removability “: <PARA> the ability to break windows in case of emergency was not mentioned anywhere in this discussion , and the major industry concerns appeared to be visibility and whiplash prevention . <PARA> federal motor vehicle safety standard 202 does not require automakers to manufacture head restraints specifically so that they can be used to break windows in emergencies . while some can potentially be used that way , they are not designed with that specific purpose in mind .	
mixture	the prohibition era lasted little more than a decade — from 1920 to 1933 — but its effects stretched far beyond those years . speakeasies and saloons are still lionized by historical fetishists , and slang from that era is still in american english today . <PARA> one popular story about prohibition is that the cocktail ( using both the general definition of a “ mixed drink ” and the specific one of spirits , bitters , and sugar ) emerged as a wholly american invention , straight from the alcohol ban . the popular mixed drinks , or so the story goes , were created to dilute or mask the pungent ( if not outright nasty ) taste of moonshine or bathtub brew : <PARA> this sounds plausible , bolstered by a mixology recipe book a bit later in the century , penned by a bartender named “ professor ” jerry thomas and advancing the claim that cocktails came straight from the states . <PARA> but human nature being what it is , how plausible is it that humanity has been consuming fermented drinks for thousands of years and only stumbled onto cocktails in the past few hundred ? as it turns out , not very . despite “ professor ” thomas ’ s valuable contributions to cocktail culture , not even the word is american : the first time the word can be found in print ( at least where the drinks are concerned ) is in 1798 — in a london newspaper . ( thomas worked in london before returning to the united states .) <PARA> so americans didn ’ t invent the cocktail , after all . but they did help popularize it — just not during prohibition . mixed drinks actually showed up long before the 1920s ; they were already well known in colonial times , an era in which alcohol was consumed routinely and enthusiastically . a 1991 article in the organization of american historians magazine of history has alcohol consumption in the late 1700s at about three and a half gallons per person a year , or double today ’ s rates : <PARA> that alcohol was often in the form of various mixed drinks , but they didn ’ t officially evolve into the cocktail ( officially , a mixture of “ aromatic bitters ” mixed into spirit with water and a dash of sugar ) until a bit later . bitters , which are highly concentrated plant extracts , were used medicinally for centuries , but became famous in the 1800s in venezuela ( home of angostura ) when they were used to treat simon bolivar ’ s army . as bitters were often taken with spirits and sugar to make them more palatable , they quickly went from medicinal to recreational use . <PARA> back in the united states , the rate of alcohol consumption was rising quickly . historian w . j . rorabaugh writes that by the 1830s , the average person drank around four gallons of alcoholic beverages per year : <PARA> according to cocktail historian david wondrich , bitters were an easy addition to the ferment , with the added bonus of being medicinal ( early advertising sold bitters as hangover cures ). it was an addition to which both europeans and americans took enthusiastically : <PARA> alcohol use continued to grow until prohibition cut it , but not by as much as temperance proponents thought it might . speakeasies quickly sprang up like mushrooms after a rain ; a thriving black market brought in beer , wine , and liquor ; and everyone knew someone with a still somewhere . <PARA> but speakeasies , where the threat of raids loomed every moment , weren ’ t a place to nurse your elegant and sophisticated mixed drink , no matter what you might have heard . they were instead a place to bolt down alcoholic drinks as quickly as possible , writes wondrich : <PARA> after prohibition ended , “ americans didn ’ t know a damn thing about drinking ,” esquire lamented . ( the magazine was launched in 1933 , the same year prohibition was repealed .) the elegant tastes of medicinal bitters and delicately mixed drinks were all but forgotten : <PARA> so clearly , cocktail culture had to be built up again from scratch . luckily , the old world had never even considered an alcohol ban and so the recipes were there , waiting to return to the united states , once prohibition was repealed . <PARA> and what of the word “ cocktail ?” how did a drink that began as a hangover cure and medicinal morning pick - me - up get its name ? its history is murky and its etymology difficult to pin down , but cocktail historian david wondrich says he thinks his theory is “ pretty solid ”:

false	on 5 april 2016 the web site news4ktla published an article reporting that a female rape victim had cut off a rapist ’ s genitals and then forced him to eat them : <PARA> the claim spread on social media for a number of reasons . one was that the fabricated story falls neatly into the always - popular category of “ justice porn ,” presenting a narrative involving a crime and a victim who manages to turn the tables on her attacker . the second was the appropriation of los angeles - area outlet ktla ‘ s call letters in the name of the site ( the two sites are not related ). <PARA> the photograph of the purported rapist was in actuality an old mugshot taken on or before 4 october 2014 , unrelated to any rape cases in april 2015 . <PARA> while news4ktla carries no disclaimer warning readers its content is fabricated ( its “ about ” page simply describes it as “ local news for southern louisiana and the surrounding area ”), the site appears to be one of many fly - by - night fake news purveyors using visual and call - letter elements to trick social media users into spreading misinformation .

false	on or around 5 march 2016 , a social media rumor began to circulate that bernie sanders was not on the “ chicago sample primary ballot ”: <PARA> on 7 march 2016 , a daily kos diarist published an entry (“ bernie sanders omitted from chicago democratic sample ballot ”) advancing the rumor that sanders was omitted from primary ballots in chicago . on 8 march 2016 , the facebook page “ the people for bernie sanders 2016 ” published a photo of a “ sample ballot ”: <PARA> commenters on that post were quick to point out that votes for sanders could and had been cast in that primary , calling the claim into question : <PARA> from that point , many other social media users inferred that the only way to cast a vote for sanders was through a write - in vote , assuming he was not listed on ballots . the claim reached a much larger audience when actor and comedian sarah silverman sent the following tweet on 10 march 2016 : <PARA> at that point , the claim was also receiving additional visibility on facebook : <PARA> many were confused by the use of the term “ sample ballot ,” believing that they were literal samples of the actual documents . further complicating matters was the fact that the chicago board of elections did make available sample ballots viewable by voters ahead of primary elections ; some people seemed to be confusing actual sample ballots with party - issued endorsements . <PARA> we spoke to an individual at chicago ’ s board of elections , who told he he was aware of the claims and explained that social media users were confusing campaign literature with actual state ballots . he confirmed that sanders was indeed a candidate for whom registered voters in chicago and the state of illinois could vote if they wished , and that “ sample ballots ” were not in any way to be considered legitimate examples of actual primary election ballots . <PARA> the chicago board of elections has an official web site where anyone can view an official sample ballot ( a valid address was a pre - requisite to view the ballot , and we used the cook county democrats n . lasalle street location ). sanders was indeed listed on that ballot : <PARA> the controversial campaign literature was also available on the cook county democratic party ’ s web site , both as a page and a downloadable pdf . both versions were labeled as indicative of the party ’ s endorsement of clinton , not sanders : <PARA> while it was true that the “ sample ballot ” existed , it announced 2016 endorsements made by cook county democrats and wasn ’ t a board of elections sample ballot . an 8 march 2016 tweet featured a screencap in which the former organization attempted to explain their endorsement : <PARA> since cook county democrats endorsed hillary clinton , their “ sample ballot ” simply advised voters of the group ’ s preferred voting slate . however , sanders was not omitted from any official ballots , nor did supporters in cook county need to write - in a primary ballot vote for sanders . whether or not voters in chicago and elsewhere approved of cook county democrats ’ endorsements , the sample ballot had no bearing on actual official ballots where sanders appeared alongside clinton as a candidate . localized political parties regularly can and do endorse their own preferred candidates , an activity that is both common and accepted in the course of elections .	
mixture	on 1 march 2016 , a number of american states held “ super tuesday ” primaries . the next day , google trends tweeted that searches originating from the united states about emigrating from the to canada reached an all - time high : <PARA> google offered no explanation for the spike , but on 2 march 2016 , the washington post published a piece that maintained that the real winner of super tuesday was “ canada ”: <PARA> the washington post included a tweet of a screenshot of the canadian immigration web site published late on 1 march 2015 : <PARA> however , it wasn ’ t immediately clear whether super tuesday ( or any other specific event ) spurred the search spike . u . s . news & world report dug into the data , and discovered that the searches were indeed highest in two states where trump won primaries on super tuesday ( massachusetts and virginia ). <PARA> but that outlet uncovered some other related search data that suggested the cause and effect wasn ’ t necessarily cut and dried . for example , democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders received equal attention in related searches , but no one seemed to be blaming the spike on him : <PARA> vox pointed out that while the spike following the re - election of george w . bush appeared smaller , that was also a period before smartphones and widespread use of social media . time reported that immigration did increase following that election , but no one is sure specifically what caused that uptick . ( confounding factors like a weak economy or increased internet relationships could have also been factors .) <PARA> shortly after the story made its rounds , psychology professor adam alter speculated that few truly would leave the united states : <PARA> a key aspect of the rumor hinged on the number of americans searching for ways to get out of the country on canada ’ s official immigration site , but when we visited that link on 9 march 2016 , a nearly identical error message appeared : <PARA> the exact impetus for the rise in searches for the phrase “ move to canada ” remains unclear . while americans on both sides of the aisle threaten to leave the country for political reasons during every election , studies suggest that only a handful follow through with such plans . also , reported error messages on the canadian immigration website on 1 march 2016 were still in place on 9 march 2016 , more than a week after the spike in searches abated .

false	in february 2016 , an old internet conspiracy theory was revived when several media outlets picked up a youtube video which asserted that jonbenét ramsey ( a six - year - old beauty pageant star who was killed in 1996 , and whose murder remains unsolved ) never actually died , and instead grew up to be singer katy perry : <PARA> the conspiracy theory is based on a variety of observations , but none of the claims are especially convincing . for example , one piece of “ evidence ” is that katy perry and jonbenét ramsey have similar eyebrows . another piece of incidental information cited as evidence is that the pop singer once mentioned ramsey during an interview . the full quote , which can be found in perry ’ s biography , reads : <PARA> it ’ s unclear how the above - displayed quote , in which katy perry says that she is not jonbenét ramsey , proves that she is jonbenét ramsey . <PARA> the creator of the conspiracy video , david johnson , has produced dozens of similar pieces , each offering up “ proof ” that one person is really another . in addition to katy perry as jonbenét , johnson also claims that donald trump is joe biden , jimmy hendrix is lionel ritchie , and prince charles is sir richard branson : <PARA> despite the video , johnson isn ’ t the first to subscribe to this particular theory . the idea was first floated on various internet forums after the pop singer shared a “ glamour shot ” of herself as a child in august 2010 : <PARA> while most comments more or less jokingly pointed out the young perry ’ s ( very slight ) resemblance to jonbenét , this photo provided the seed for a new conspiracy theory . <PARA> this isn ’ t even the first time that a pop singer has been accused of being an adult jonbenét . before katy perry , it was lady gaga , but unlike katy perry ’ s conspiracy theory , which centered on the singer ’ s eyebrows , the “ evidence ” for lady gaga focused on her ears : <PARA> there are many logical flaws with these theories . first , perry was born in 1984 , six years before jonbenét ( and lady gaga , née stefani germanotta , was born in 1986 ). second , perry ’ s childhood is well - documented , as is lady gaga ’ s : <PARA> finally , while the tragic case of jonbenét ramsey ’ s murder remains unsolved , that doesn ’ t mean that she is still alive . police discovered ramsey ’ s body in her family ’ s basement on 26 december 1996 , and an autopsy was performed not long afterward .

false	in the months leading up to the 2016 united states presidential election , stories abounded about the relationships between the clinton foundation and various foreign entities . <PARA> may 2015 saw the publication of a book called clinton cash : the untold story of how and why foreign governments and businesses helped make bill and hillary rich , an exposé of alleged clinton foundation corruption written by peter schweizer , a former hoover institution fellow and editor - at - large at the right - wing media company breitbart . <PARA> a chapter in the book suggests that the clinton family and russia each may have benefited from a “ pay - for - play ” scheme while hillary clinton was secretary of state , involving the transfer of u . s . uranium reserves to the new russian owners of an international mining operation in exchange for $ 145 million in donations to the clinton foundation . <PARA> the mining company , uranium one , was originally based in south africa , but merged in 2007 with canada - based urasia energy . shareholders there retained a controlling interest until 2010 , when russia ’ s nuclear agency , rosatom , completed purchase of a 51 % stake . hillary clinton played a part in the transaction insofar as it involved the transfer of ownership of a material deemed important to national security — uranium , amounting to one - fifth of u . s . reserves ( a fraction re - estimated by the u . s . nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) at closer to one - tenth of the united states ’ uranium production capacity in 2017 ) — thus requiring the approval of the committee on foreign investment in the united states ( cfius ), on which the u . s . secretary of state sits . <PARA> during the same time frame that the acquisition took place , the clinton foundation accepted contributions from nine individuals associated with uranium one totaling more than $ 100 million , schweizer claimed in clinton cash . among those who followed schweizer in citing the transaction as an instance of alleged clinton corruption was gop presidential nominee donald trump , who said during a june 2016 speech in new york city : <PARA> trump ’ s campaign repeated the allegation in a september 2016 press release , and again in an october 2016 television ad stating that clinton “ gave american uranium rights to the russians ”: <PARA> an image circulating via social media during the final months of the presidential campaign asked the question , “ so hillary , if russia is such a threat , why did you sell them 20 % of our uranium ? are you a liar , or a traitor , or both ?” <PARA> the uranium one deal was not clinton ’ s to veto or approve <PARA> <PARA> among the ways these accusations stray from the facts is in attributing a power of veto or approval to secretary clinton that she simply did not have . clinton was one of nine cabinet members and department heads that sit on the cfius , and the secretary of the treasury is its chairperson . cfius members are collectively charged with evaluating proposed foreign acquisitions for potential national security issues , then turning their findings over to the president . by law , the committee can ’ t veto a transaction ; only the president can . <PARA> all nine federal agencies were required to approve the uranium one transaction before it could go forward . according to the new york times , clinton may not have even directly participated in the decision . then - assistant secretary of state jose fernandez , whose job it was to represent the state dept . on cfius , said clinton “ never intervened ” in committee matters . clinton herself has said she wasn ’ t personally involved . <PARA> there is no evidence that uranium went to russia <PARA> that a change of company ownership occurred doesn ’ t mean that 10 to 20 percent of america ’ s uranium literally went to russia . neither uranium one nor armz ( rosatom ’ s mining subsidiary ) is licensed to export uranium from the u . s . to other countries . <PARA> some exports did occur , however . <PARA> a 2015 letter from nrc official mark satorius to a member of congress revealed that an unspecified amount of yellowcake ( semi - processed ) uranium was shipped from a uranium one facility in wyoming to canada between 2012 and 2014 for conversion ( additional processing to prepare it for enrichment ). a portion of that uranium was subsequently shipped to enrichment plants in europe . <PARA> the transfers to canada were legal despite uranium one ’ s not holding an export license because the nrc granted such a license to the company that transported it . the transfers to europe were legal because they were approved by another agency , the u . s . dept . of energy . satorius stressed that the transfers were subject to nrc oversight and all applicable safety and national security regulations : <PARA> additionally , a small amount of that exported uranium was , in fact , sold to other countries . according to a 2 november 2017 article in the hill , uranium one officials acknowledged that approximately 25 percent of the yellowcake exported for conversion was subsequently sold via “ book transfer ” to customers in western europe and asia ( yellowcake being a fungible commodity , that doesn ’ t necessarily translate to a physical transfer of the product , however ). <PARA> to date , there is no evidence that any of this uranium made its way to russia . an nrc spokesman cited by factcheck . org in october 2017 reaffirmed satorius ’ s assurances that “ the u . s . government has not authorized any country to re - transfer u . s . uranium to russia .” nrc officials also say they ’ re unaware of any uranium one exports from the u . s . to foreign countries since 2014 . <PARA> the timing of most of the clinton foundation donations does not match <PARA> <PARA> of the $ 145 million allegedly contributed to the clinton foundation by uranium one investors , the lion ’ s share — $ 131 . 3 million — came from a single donor , frank giustra , the company ’ s canadian founder . but giustra sold off his entire stake in the company in 2007 , three years before the russia deal and at least 18 months before clinton became secretary of state . <PARA> of the remaining individuals connected with uranium one who donated to the clinton foundation , only one was found to have contributed during the same time frame that the deal was taking place , according to the new york times — ian telfer ( also a canadian ), the company ’ s chairman : <PARA> in addition to the clinton foundation donations , the new york times also cited a $ 500 , 000 speaking fee paid to former president bill clinton by a russian investment bank in june 2010 , before the uranium one deal was approved : <PARA> the timing of telfer ’ s clinton foundation donations and bill clinton ’ s renaissance capital speaking fee might be questionable if there was reason to believe that hillary clinton was instrumental in the approval of the deal with russia , but all the evidence points to the contrary — that clinton did not play a pivotal role , and , in fact , may not have played any role at all . moreover , neither clinton nor her department possessed sole power of approval over said transaction . <PARA> foundation admits to disclosure mistakes <PARA> <PARA> one fault investigations into the clinton foundation ’ s practices did find was that not all of the donations were properly disclosed — specifically , those of uranium one chairman ian telfer between 2009 and 2012 . the foundation admitted this shortcoming and pledged to correct it , but as the guardian pointed out in its may 2015 discussion of clinton cash , the fact that it happened is reason enough to sound alarm bells : <PARA> an enormous volume of interest and speculation surrounds the workings of the clinton foundation , which is to be expected . given the enormous sums of money it controls and the fact that it is run by a former u . s . president who is married to a former u . s . secretary of state and presidential candidate , the foundation deserves all the scrutiny it gets , and more . <PARA> at the same time , for the sake of accuracy it ’ s crucial to differentiate between partisan accusations and what we actually know about it — however little that may be . <PARA> update <PARA> on 17 october 2017 , the hill reported obtaining evidence that vadim mikerin , a russian official who oversaw the american operations of the russian nuclear agency rosatom , was being investigated for corruption by multiple u . s . agencies while the uranium one deal was up for approval — information that apparently was not shared with u . s . officials involved in approving the transaction . the hill also reported receiving documents and eyewitness testimony “ indicating russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the u . s . designed to benefit former president bill clinton ’ s charitable foundation during the time secretary of state hillary clinton served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to moscow ,” although no specifics about who those russian nuclear officials were or how the money was allegedly routed to the clinton foundation were given . in any case , none of these revelations prove that secretary of state hillary clinton participated in a quid pro quo agreement to accept payment for approval of the uranium one deal . <PARA> on 24 october 2017 , the u . s . house intelligence and oversight committees announced the launch of a joint investigation into the circumstances surrounding the russian purchase of uranium one .	
false	on 15 february 2016 , an image appeared purportedly showing a tweet posted by senator ted cruz threatening to deport singer beyoncé over her performance at super bowl 50 : <PARA> while many people claimed that the above - displayed tweet was real , the message does not appear on cruz ’ s timeline , and we found no evidence proving that it ever did . in fact , there are several aspects about the above - displayed image that made us question its authenticity . <PARA> first , ted cruz is a verified twitter user , and as such his tweets appear with a blue “ verified ” mark next to his name , something that is absent from the image : <PARA> second , the above - displayed image claims that the message was retweeted by more than a thousand users . if this were true , there would be several links pointing back to cruz ’ original tweet . however , this is not the case . while the image of cruz ’ s purported tweet has been shared on social media , they are not accompanied by links pointing to a recently deleted tweet from the senator . <PARA> further , beyoncé performed at the super bowl on 7 february 2016 , and while cruz is undoubtedly busy , it would be strange for him to wait a week after the fact to comment on the singer ’ s performance . <PARA> it should also be noted that the above - displayed fake tweet was originally accompanied by the claim that anderson cooper had captured the screenshot from cruz ’ s twitter page : <PARA> the above - displayed message , however , does not appear on any of anderson cooper ’ s social media profiles , and is as suspect as the original . while one could reasonably assume cruz would want the tweet deleted ( if it were actually sent in the first place ), there is no reason for cooper to delete his message . <PARA> web sites such as “ let me tweet that for you ” have made it easy to create twitter forgeries . for instance , ted cruz never tweeted this :	
mixture	in may 2015 , a video featuring a woman reading an “ actual children ’ s book ” called do you want to play with my balls ? went viral on youtube . the book in that video resembles a typical children ’ s book , featuring pages of illustrations superimposed with simple sentences spoken by child characters : <PARA> however , all the sentences uttered by those child characters are repetitions of old suggestive jokes involving the duality of the word “ ball ” as something referring to both a spherical objects used in sports and games and a slang term for a portion of the male genitalia ( i . e ., the testicles ): <PARA> while the video left many viewers in hysterics , others were confused by the nature of the book . was this a real product ? could you buy it in stores ? was it really meant for children ? some publications even condemned the book , terming it the “ most disgusting and evilest children ’ s book ever created !” <PARA> however , do you want to play with my balls ? ( like the popular 2011 book go the f ** k to sleep ) is not a work targeted for young readers , but rather a parody of children ’ s books intended for a grown - up audience . do you want to play with my balls ? was written by the cifaldi brothers and originally had a very small production run of about 100 copies . when the book became a viral hit , bum bum books decided to put the book back into production and started a kickstarter campaign to fund the effort : <PARA> interested readers can purchase digital copies of the book from online retailers such as amazon and itunes . <PARA> as for the book ’ s intended audience , bum bum books wrote that do you want to play with my balls ? was the perfect gift for “ parents , fun loving adults , friends , and even young children ( though it ’ s probably best that they ’ re young enough to not understand the meaning of a pun ).”

unproven	on 4 february 2016 , the uk ’ s daily mail ran an article about short video posted to liveleak that purportedly paramedics wheeling away a gurney holding a chinese man who had died during sex , as well as a prostitute who was still “ attached ” to the deceased due to a case of penis captivus : <PARA> the literal truthfulness of this sketchy report is highly questionable . the video in question is only several seconds long and merely shows an unidentified man ( suffering from an unknown medical condition in an indeterminate location ) being wheeled away in a gurney , with everything but his head and feet covered by a blanket . it appears that someone ( or something ) could be atop the man underneath the blanket , but for all we know that person ( if it is indeed a person ) could be a grieving wife who refused to be separated from her husband after he suffered a stroke or heart attack ( unrelated to sexual activity ). it isn ’ t even clear that the man in the video is in fact dead ( in which case one would usually expect that the deceased ’ s head would be concealed by the blanket as well , but here it was left exposed as if the patient still needed to breathe ). <PARA> adding to the doubtfulness of the story is the largely legendary status of the so - called penis captivus medical phenomenon , and the daily mail ‘ s penchant for falling for fantastically fictional news stories from china , including false reports of a man whose body became riddled with tapeworms due to his consumption of sashimi , a man who sued his wife for bearing him ugly children , and female students eating roundworm eggs to ensure they looked thin for job interviews .	
false	on 2 january 2016 , an event known as the “ malheur occupation ” or “ oregon standoff ” began at the headquarters of the malheur national wildlife refuge in harney county , oregon . the armed militia that occupied the building on the reserve said they were doing so in order to protest overreach by the federal government after two ranchers were sentenced to prison for arson on public lands . the standoff mostly ended on 26 january 2016 , when one occupier was shot and killed by police at a traffic stop , and eleven more were arrested . <PARA> one of the discussions that ensued as a result of this was government ownership of land . social media users focused a number of posts and tweets at policies and practices relating to the bureau of land management , particularly a common assertion about the legality of federally - managed lands when considered in light of a portion of the u . s . constitution that supposedly states : <PARA> however , these words do not appear anywhere in the u . s . constitution , so an argument that the constitution specifically prohibits the federal government from “ owning title ” to “ grazing areas ” ( without the permission of the states in which those areas are located ) fails on that basis . <PARA> some online pundits have asserted that the specific wording at issue here is found in article i , section 8 of the constitution ( at “ clause 17 ,” although it is not numbered as such ), which reads : <PARA> some background is necessary to understand this clause in its proper context . since the legislative branch ( i . e ., congress ) was the only branch of federal government that existed at the time the constitution was written , that document ’ s framers expected it to be the most important branch of government and took care to list its powers in considerable detail right up front in article i . hence that article contains “ the laundry list of federal powers ,” including section 8 , which sets forth the enumerated powers of congress ( i . e ., powers that are specifically listed as belonging to the national government ). those enumerated powers include the power to tax , the power to spend revenues for the “ common defense and general welfare of the united states ,” to regulate commerce , to coin money , to establish post offices and roads , to declare war , to raise and support an army and navy . <PARA> the so - called “ clause 17 ” of article i , section 8 deals with the issue that the constitution ’ s framers had agreed that the new nation ’ s capital should be located in a district that was independent any particular state government and subject only to federal control . thus the plan was to create a federal district no more than ten miles square from land ceded by one or more states to house the u . s . national capital , which was accomplished when the compromise of 1790 ended with agreement to form the district of columbia from landed ceded by maryland and virginia . the national capital was temporarily relocated from new york to philadelphia while construction began on homes for the president and congress , and in 1800 the united states ’ capital was moved again ( for the final time ) to washington , d . c ., in december 1800 . <PARA> “ clause 17 ” merely allows congress to exercise exclusive control over that federal district , and over any structures constructed there deemed necessary for carrying on the business of the national government ( such as forts , arsenals , and post offices ). it does not preclude the federal government from purchasing or holding title to other land within the various states , or from using public land for purposes such as establishing and managing parks , forests , dams , waterways , and grazing areas without the consent of the states in which those facilities are located . <PARA> in fact , the following clause ( commonly known as the “ necessary and proper clause ” or the “ elastic clause ”) grants congress the authority to carry out its enumerated powers , and that clause has since been broadly interpreted to allow the national government management over areas designated as national parks , federal public works projects such as dams and waterways , and livestock grazing on public rangelands . <PARA> it ’ s possible that some advocates of the “ no title to any real property ” viewpoint might be confusing the actual u . s . constitution with language found in the so - called “ texas constitution 2000 ” ( which was not an actual piece of legislation , but rather an unofficial proposed revision of the existing texas state constitution ), which contained a clause stating that “ government shall never own title to any real property which is not specifically authorized by this constitution .”

mixture	on 3 february 2016 , facebook users were surprised by an unusual trending topic , which held that donald trump had been nominated for a nobel peace prize : <PARA> the claim ’ s appearance on facebook ’ s trending topic list and fairly definitive wording led many to believe the assertion was without ambiguity : somehow , donald trump was in the running for a nobel peace prize . however , such accounts were based on a very loose definition of “ nominated ,” one that relied upon a “ nobel watcher ’ s ” report of a single letter which put forth trump ’ s name ( and was quite possibly satirical in nature ): <PARA> as such accounts noted , harpviken maintained he ’ d seen a single letter nominating trump and was of the opinion that the potential nominee had no real chance of winning the nobel peace prize . nonetheless , many social media users indicated they believed that trump had been formally nominated for the prize and / or was seriously in the running to be awarded it . <PARA> in general , anyone ‘ s name can be suggested for a nobel peace prize , and more than 200 such submissions are made annually .

false	in january 2016 , a facebook trend most commonly referenced as “ be like bill ” swept the social network . during that time , users initially posted comics wherein a character named “ bill ” served as a reinforcer of social media etiquette , before “ be like bill ” generators enabled users to create personalized versions of the meme : <PARA> as is often the case with items like “ be like bill ” that appear seemingly from the ether and go facebook - wide , it wasn ’ t long before folks became suspicious of this bill character and his purpose on their news feeds . soon after bill became the meme of the day , a backlash against the meme was started : one that first simply decried the “ scolding ” nature of the trend , then followed up with rumors that the ubiquitous comic was a vector for malware , information theft , or other undesirable outcomes : <PARA> bill proved so popular and omnipresent that multiple local news outlets carried reports about the potential dangers of creating a “ be like bill ” meme . missouri tv station kfvs , kansas city station kctv ( clip below ), and washington , d . c ., station wttg ran some concern - generating coverage about the specific comic , typically lumping it into the general category of “ clickbait ” and associating it with the risk of all unvetted apps : <PARA> as the above - quoted material stated , facebook has indeed presented a handy way for bad actors to engage in all sorts of unpleasant activities using compelling content . however , the “ in some cases ” outcomes described apply to malicious apps in general and not specifically to any known vulnerabilities linked to the “ be like bill ” meme . <PARA> many articles cited extant better business bureau warnings about rogue apps that antedated “ be like bill ” and referenced “ clickbait ,” but the term was applied exceptionally broadly and not specifically to malware . in short , whether an item is clickbait itself has no bearing on its potential to cause harm to computers or accounts , and plenty of clickbait exists just to drive traffic to various web sites . <PARA> of additional interest ( in bold ) was a widely - reproduced excerpt from the terms of service of publisher blobla ’ s ( who offered a mechanism for customizing “ be like bob ” memes ) that purportedly stated end users agreed to “ allow [ blobla ] to use , edit your content with our service permanently , no limit and no recover .” we were unable to verify such language ever appeared in the agreement in question , and no such wording was in the their agreement as of 27 january 2016 . <PARA> on 27 january 2016 , chicago station wmaq published an article which reported that the better business bureau ( bbb ) didn ’ t suggest “ be like bill ” posed any specific threat at all to social media users and added that the president and ceo of the better business bureau of chicago and northern illinois steve bernas had confirmed only that the bbb was looking into the meme ( and keeping an eye out for impostors ). <PARA> according to the outlet , blobla clarified that the generator didn ’ t require facebook authorizations of the sort generally associated with malware or rogue apps : <PARA> blobla ’ s creators also explained that the now - elided , widely - cited verbiage (“ permanently , no limit and no recover ”) was poorly composed and pertained to unrelated functions which might have ended up on their web site : <PARA> on 29 january 2016 , bbb communications director katherine hutt clarified the bureau ’ s stance on “ be like bill ,” due to the multiple news reports conflating their earlier “ clickbait ” warnings with that particular meme and generator : <PARA> finally , outlets devoted to more detailed reporting on online security ( such as sophos ’ naked security blog ) haven ’ t issued any warnings about “ be like bill ” or the popular comic generator . no widespread reports of adverse outcomes have substantiated news affiliate speculation , and the bulk of “ be like bill ”- themed reports focused on the general ability for malware to spread through apps , not any reports definitively ( or anecdotally ) related to that meme specifically . while users might tire of seeing bill across their feeds , he doesn ’ t pose a threat to anything more than annoyance - free browsing .	
false	on 18 november 2015 , the entertainment web site real news right now published a fake news article claiming that a saudi billionaire had purchased buford , wyoming and was planning on building “ the mecca of the west ”: <PARA> the above - quoted story didn ’ t gain much traction when it was first published , but on 25 january 2016 , web sites such as liveleak and tapwires republished the dubious article with the addition of unrelated photos , managing to convince twitter users that the plans to build a “ mecca of the west ” were real . a video purportedly showing the construction site was also published to youtube . <PARA> these claims , however , are completely fabricated . the story about the saudi billionaire purchasing buford , wyoming originated on a fake news web site . while real news right now does not specifically label itself as a satire publication , its “ about ” section is full of lies and exaggerations about its ( likely completely fictional ) fictional founder , r . hobbus j . d . <PARA> the clearest nod to the site ’ s humorous intent is the claim that hobbus was awarded the “ prestigious stephen glass distinction in journalistic integrity ,” a non - existent award named after a journalist best known for completely making up news stories . <PARA> however , the reality does mirror the fake story to a certain degree . while buford , wyoming ( population : 1 ) will not be turned into the “ mecca of the west ,” the town actually was purchased by pham dinh nguyen in 2013 for $ 900 , 000 , and then renamed phindeli town buford .	
mixture	a photograph purportedly showing a man next to a utility pole that had seemingly been buried by “ 40 feet of snow ” began recirculating online in january 2016 after it was posted to the reddit community site . while the photograph is real , it is highly unlikely that the man seen in the picture is standing on top of “ 40 feet of snow .” <PARA> the photograph was taken in jamestown , north dakota , on 9 march 1966 by bill koch of the north dakota state highway department . the image can be found in the archives of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration ’ s ( noaa ) national weather service , but the photograph ’ s caption doesn ’ t provide any additional information about the blizzard : <PARA> in the state historical society of north dakota ’ s record of the 1966 blizzard , they wrote that the depth of the snowfall reached 35 inches in some places , but that most areas received 20 inches of snow or less . while some snowdrifts reached heights of 30 feet , there ’ s no record in extant reports of a large area being covered by 40 feet of snow : <PARA> it ’ s also impossible to determine the size of the utility pole in this photograph . while a 40 - foot high wooden utility pole isn ’ t a uncommon object , there ’ s no way to tell whether the pole featured in this picture is that tall . it should also be noted that at least one image from the state historical society of north dakota shows a much smaller utility pole next to the railroad :	
mixture	despite her current status as a democratic icon , former first lady , u . s . senator , secretary of state , and presidential candidate hillary clinton had some significant exposure to conservative politics in her youth . in her autobiography living history , clinton described her father as a “ rock - ribbed , up - by - your - bootstraps , conservative republican and proud of it ” and noted that she had been a young republican and a supporter of arizona senator barry goldwater , the most prominent conservative republican of his era , during goldwater ’ s ( failed ) 1964 presidential campaign against incumbent lyndon johnson : <PARA> hillary clinton didn ’ t last long on that side of the political spectrum , however , reporting that “ by the time i was a college junior , i had gone from being a goldwater girl to supporting the [ 1968 ] anti - war campaign of eugene mccarthy .” <PARA> the meme shown above ( circulated on social media in conjunction with the martin luther king day holiday ) plays on that brief period of ms . clinton ’ s early political interest , claiming that she both “ actively campaigned ” and “ voted ” for goldwater , a candidate who sought to “ overturn the civil rights act ” and “ re - segregate the nation .” those statements are highly exaggerated versions of what clinton and goldwater actually thought and did , however . <PARA> although hillary clinton may have been a goldwater supporter in 1964 , saying she “ actively campaigned ” for him implies a more substantive role than the one she actually played . she was a mere 16 - year - old who wasn ’ t a member of the goldwater campaign staff in any way , nor did she even meet the candidate — she related in living history that she had to persuade her father to drive her and a friend to hear goldwater speak when the gop nominee made a campaign swing by train through the chicago suburbs . and although hillary clinton might have wanted to vote for barry goldwater in 1964 , the fact is that she didn ’ t : she turned 17 just a few weeks before the election and thus wasn ’ t eligible to vote for anyone , as the minimum voting age at the time was 21 . <PARA> likewise , although barry goldwater famously voted against the civil rights act of 1964 in the senate ( one of six republicans to do so ), he was no opponent of civil rights who sought to “ re - segregate the nation .” goldwater had supported earlier attempts to pass civil rights legislation in 1957 and 1960 , as well as the 24th amendment ( which outlawed poll taxes that disenfranchised southern black voters ), and his stated opposition to the civil rights act of 1964 ( which he otherwise favored ) was based on his belief that two portions of the bill regulating the behavior of private enterprise were unconstitutional , would be unenforceable without a federal police force , and would lead to the creation of racial quotas and affirmative action : <PARA> although goldwater voted against the civil rights act of 1964 as a senator , we found no record of his having vowed to overturn it as a presidential candidate .

unproven	in late 2015 , chipotle outlets in multiple states were affected by an outbreak of foodborne illness , and as a result , the chain closed stores in several states while the issue was investigated .

true	in december 2015 , a meme titled “ meet rachel hoffman ” became popular on social media : <PARA> social media interest in hoffman was piqued when the facebook page free talk live shared the meme on 7 december 2015 : <PARA> the meme was spread as part of a debate over whether drug law enforcement was more detrimental to society as a whole than drug use . although most commenters were horrified to hear of hoffman ’ s fate , at least one was less than sympathetic , holding that hoffman was not simply a recreational drug user caught up in a nightmare scenario with drug dealers but a drug dealer herself : <PARA> as many viewers surmised , hoffman ’ s story was far too complex to be accurately summarized by an image meme . the basic assertions of the meme were accurate , though significant details were obscured by its brief verbiage . <PARA> on 22 february 2007 , florida state university graduate rachel hoffman was found to be in possession of a relatively small amount of marijuana ( 25 grams ) during a routine traffic stop . contemporaneous news reports about hoffman tended to begin with her tragic death and work backwards , so details of her involvement with police after that traffic stop were revealed slowly and sometimes only after initial , less accurate information was reported . <PARA> according to a local news report , on 17 april 2008 , while hoffman was under drug court supervision stemming the february 2007 traffic stop , tallahassee police searched her apartment and turned up cannabis and a small quantity of ecstasy : <PARA> a 13 may 2008 abc news article ( published on the same day hoffman was buried ) offered initial information about how that traffic stop eventually led to hoffman ’ s bullet - ridden body being found in a ditch in april 2008 : <PARA> questions frequently up in discussions of hoffman ’ s death involved the amounts of various drugs she purportedly possessed and whether she was herself selling marijuana and other substances . a september 2013 post written by hoffman ’ s friend elizabeth patty - lugo and titled “ my best friend rachel hoffman was murdered at 23 - years - old ” said that police estimates of hoffman ’ s involvement in the drug trade were wildly implausible : <PARA> patty - lugo ’ s lengthy account described the circumstances under which hoffman ’ s home was raided , as well as the choice hoffman faced following the raid ( emphasizing hoffman ’ s request that patty - lugo covertly film the buy - bust , and hoffman ’ s fears that the police would deny her “ credit ” for the risky undertaking .) by patty - lugo ’ s account , police convinced rachel that she would be “ covered ” at all times during the operation , and that the worst possible outcome would be a “ fake arrest ”: <PARA> patty - lugo maintained that she and hoffman continued contact throughout the botched buy - bust , claiming that hoffman was incorrectly wired and that she inaccurately believed law enforcement officers were tailing her . at the end of a detailed minute - by - minute account , patty - lugo wrote : <PARA> the placement of the wire in hoffman ’ s purse emerged as one of the key disputed procedures examined after her death . in september 2012 , npr interviewed new yorker writer sarah stillman about an article she had written concerning hoffman ’ s case . in that npr segment , stillman said : <PARA> stillman ’ s september 2012 new yorker piece examined the largely unmonitored involvement of individuals like hoffman in drug enforcement operations . focusing on the “ recruitment of young informants often involves risks that are incommensurate with the charges that they are facing ,” stillman painted hoffman as out of her depth and without recourse : <PARA> among the details uncovered in the years following hoffman ’ s death was that the “ raid ” could never have succeeded as planned . hoffman , pressured to participate in a narcotics transaction far out of her league , was pegged as a mark by her assailants : <PARA> another element stillman focused on in her piece was the initial statements made by police when news of hoffman ’ s death broke . on the morning hoffman ’ s body was found , the tallahassee police department ( tpd ) told the press hoffman had brought about her own death not following protocol . hoffman ’ s parents later described that moment as the start of “ the smearing ” of their daughter : <PARA> rachel ’ s body was found on 9 may 2008 , and a local news article published that day included the following passage , suggesting her involvement with the buy - bust was voluntary and that she had ignored precautions set up for her in the preparations for the buy - bust : <PARA> according to stillman ’ s piece ( and several other articles ), hoffman ’ s parents were ultimately awarded $ 2 . 6 million in a wrongful death suit against the city of tallahassee and provided a formal apology . hoffman ’ s parents also founded an organization devoted to warning young people about the risks of becoming confidential informants . <PARA> on 1 july 2009 a bill known as “ rachel ’ s law ” was adopted in florida , aimed at providing greater protection to individuals find themselves in situations such as rachel hoffman ’ s . <PARA> andrea green and deneilo bradshaw were sentenced to life in prison for the murder of hoffman . <PARA> ultimately , the basic facts of the meme were correct . rachel hoffman was caught at a traffic stop in possession of a small amount of marijuana ; a raid conducted while she was under subsequent drug court supervision turned up a handful of pills and a few ounces of marijuana . under threat of prosecution , hoffman agreed to act as a confidential informant but lacked criminal connections to fulfill police requests . in an effort to avoid prosecution , she engaged in a police - supervised transaction with known criminals under orders to purchase massive quantities of drugs and a firearm . the men with whom she transacted intended to rip her off and sell her aspirin ; upon discovering a wire improperly placed in her purse , they murdered her . by all accounts , hoffman was a regular user of marijuana who sold small quantities to friends , and not a career drug dealer .

unproven	on 26 november 2015 , youtube user blackfriday fight uploaded a video (“ lady steals from kid ! black friday 2015 ”) and comments as shown below : <PARA> according to the uploader ( who conveniently wished to remain anonymous ) the footage was captured at an unnamed retail location in saginaw , michigan on black friday . the video was uploaded on 26 november 2015 ( one day prior to black friday , which fell on 27 november 2015 ), but could conceivably have depicted a midnight “ doorbuster ” sale scenario . <PARA> the clip depicts a crowd of shoppers descending upon a stack of what appear to be vegetable steamers , which ( while possibly attractively priced ) weren ’ t on par with cabbage patch kids or furbys in the genre of “ christmas crazes .” we searched for major chain store deals on vegetable steamers in 2015 , but were unable to locate any incredible deals matching vegetable steaming gadgets in any big box stores . <PARA> as commenters immediately pointed out , the short clip itself featured a number of indicators it was staged . in addition to plausibility ( even most vegans have not nearly that much interest in acquiring a vegetable steamer ) the “ victims ” in the clip were first spotted in a frame away from the fracas , walking into the area of the frenzy carrying identical boxes . <PARA> the clip opened with a rush of shoppers , all of whom appeared to fall to the ground in a dramatic and entirely unnecessary fashion : <PARA> the woman whose child was targeted by the box - snatcher didn ’ t appear to enter with other customers , instead appearing far off in a visible aisle already carrying the boxes : <PARA> finally , the purported altercation in which the woman swiped a vegetable steamer box from the hands of a small child occurred while several boxes remained unclaimed nearby . both shoppers were just inches from the uncontested vegetable steamers , providing no reason for a heartless shopper to target a small child . <PARA> the circumstances under which the clip was shot have yet to be disclosed , but its early appearance and implausible events suggest the video was staged for attention or a larger prank . ( users across social media commenting on the video widely suspected late - night host jimmy kimmel , but no evidence suggested the clip was his work .)	
unproven	origins : on 27 august 2015 a facebook user shared the above - reproduced image , claiming that the mother of president dwight d . eisenhower was an “ orphaned mulatto woman named ida stover .” although the claim was novel to many social media users , questions about eisenhower ’ s racial background were not : for example , an 8 january 2004 new york times article titled “ surprises in the family tree ” examined why the topic of race and ancestry is sometimes complicated across american history : <PARA> the article only briefly mentioned eisenhower and stover , in a manner that referenced the rumor without providing conclusive detail : <PARA> according to that article , there were merely “ questions ” about stover ’ s racial ancestry ( which had lingered for “ decades ,” seemingly without answer ). wikipedia also addresses the rumor on a page titled “ african - american heritage of united states presidents ,” where eisenhower is listed under presidents with unverified claims of african ancestry , alongside thomas jefferson , andrew jackson , abraham lincoln , warren g . harding , and calvin coolidge . the page is prefaced with a note that the claims originated primarily with “ amateur historians ,” were not “ verified by reliable sources in peer - reviewed publications ,” and that “[ m ] ainline historians do not support these claims ”: <PARA> the times ‘ 2004 article was published well before the candidacy of barack obama , but rumors of eisenhower ’ s purported african roots predictably surfaced alongside obama ’ s then - burgeoning campaign . a 5 february 2008 pittsburgh - post gazette article emphasized that such claims were not considered credible by historians and geneologists : <PARA> another portion of that 2008 article noted that the claims should be simple to resolve , given recent advances in genetic mapping technology : <PARA> the set of larger rumors ( mentioning but not focusing on eisenhower ) were addressed again by npr in a june 2008 segment titled “ has america already had a black president ?” which primarily explored the reasons behind ( and not the credibility of ) such rumors . the election of president obama predictably reinvigorated the rumors , and a 5 november 2008 emporia gazette article described the claims as comprising mostly visual evidence ( i . e ., photographs of ida stover ) and gaps in her family tree : <PARA> elsewhere on the internet , an undated page on the web site frenchcreoles . com presented the same shallow reasoning : that ida stover visually appeared to be biracial , and her ancestry was not well - documented . moreover , the site asserted that one family name ( link , which is not an uncommon surname ) was common among both white and black families : <PARA> a site called rasta livewire made similar , rumor - based assertions about ida stover ’ s racial ancestry : <PARA> while rumors about president eisenhower ’ s purportedly mixed - race maternal lineage became more popular during and after the election of president obama , the claims remain unsupported and unsubtantiated . the primary sources for the claim were a 50 - year - old self - published book and many decades of repetition , while substantive evidence for the assertion hinged largely on ida stover ’ s 1885 wedding photograph ( which many viewers believed hinted at a mixed racial lineage ) as well as the concurrent existence of black and white families with the surname link in her hometown during her youth . <PARA> neither source was a convincing evidentiary finding , and in the time since the rumors began , the advancement of dna research has made it fairly easy to resolve such questions . to date , no one has conclusively proved president eisenhower wasn ’ t part black , but neither has anyone presented any clear evidence affirming he was . <PARA> originally published : 25 november 2015

unproven	examples : [ collected via e - mail , november 2015 ] <PARA> origins : on 13 november 2015 , more than 130 people were killed during a series of coordinated attacks by isis militants in paris . in response to the tragedy , facebook introduced a profile photo overlay of the french flag so their users across the world could convey support for and solidarity with france . <PARA> on 16 november 2015 , a facebook user published the above - reproduced warning to the group “ military mama network .” according to the individual who shared it , “ a landlocked marine / naval installation ” was briefed on 16 november 2015 regarding facebook profile photo filters presenting a security threat , and they were warned to remove the french flag from profile images lest isis track the families of military members to their homes and harm them . ( how the use of a french flag in a profile photo facilitated that chain of events was unclear , nor was any explanation offered to demonstrate whether isis really could carry out such cunning ruse based solely on french flag - free avatars .) <PARA> the poster admitted that the claim made little sense and asserted that french flag avatars in no way further compromised the security of military families . in fact , she did a handy job of debunking the implausible assertion herself in one of several replies to ( sometimes skeptical ) group members : <PARA> as the individual posting the rumor correctly observed , military families were no more likely than non - military ones to express solidarity with paris via the profile filter , rendering it useless as a “ tracking tool ” by isis . moreover , she added that the trend was equally prolific worldwide , further limiting its already questionable potential for use by islamic state militants to locate military families specifically . the rumor appeared to be a possible variation on an earlier , baseless social media claim isis was using social media postings to target military families . <PARA> had any security threat been posed ( or even suggested by higher ups ) to military families , it ’ s likely the message would have been received or disseminated outside a single facebook group by a civilian . we were unable to locate any credible versions of the claim , nor determine any plausible means by which isis operatives could employ a globally - active french flag profile filter primarily used by civilians to target and harm military families . and if isis truly sought to locate the families of american servicemen on facebook , it seemed more reasonable to assume an open group called “ military mama network ” was a better starting point than a photo filter used by everyone , everywhere in the world . <PARA> finally , warnings such as the french flag profile filter rumor are only useful if they ’ re disseminated and widely adopted . chances were fairly strong that if any threat ( even remote ) was posed by the use of a facebook photo filter , those potentially in harm ’ s way would be properly warned not to use the function . <PARA> originally published : 16 november 2015

mixture	thanks in part to a long - discredited ( but deeply entrenched ) assertion that the mmr ( measles , mumps , and rubella ) vaccine has been linked to increased rates of autism , fear of vaccination has been rife on blogs and social media groups devoted to the discussion of alternative medicine . a common , uniting element of such rumors is their longevity , due in part to the oft - present claim that the purported “ vaccine truth ” has been covered up or buried by large interests , in particular , the u . s . centers for disease control ( cdc ). <PARA> in october 2015 , many alternative health sites published some variation of a claim the cdc had “ admitted ” that 98 million americans had over the years been injected with a cancer - causing virus along with their polio vaccine . then in keeping with the template of the rumor , the cdc supposedly endeavored to immediately eradicate that information from any form of record . why they “ admitted ” such a thing on the internet in the first place rather than concealing it entirely is not addressed by the rumors : the cdc of conspiracy theory imagination is always clever enough to do retroactive clean - up in an attempt to cover their tracks but never smart enough to avoid publishing damaging information in the first place . but fortunately a few eagle - eyed folks managed to bust the vast conspiracy via the magic of google cache : <PARA> on 25 october 2015 , viral alternative news published an article titled “ cdc admits 98 million americans were given a cancer causing virus via the polio shot ,” which followed on the heels of a september 2015 article from the web site vaccines . news headlined “ cdc admits 98 million americans were given cancer virus via the polio shot ” ( credited to a reporter by the name of “ evilnews ”), the latter of which cited investmentwatch ‘ s august 2015 piece titled “ cdc admits 98 million americans received polio vaccine in an 8 - year span when it was contaminated with cancer virus ”: <PARA> first of all , the cdc never “ admitted ” that anyone ever contracted cancer from a polio vaccination . what the cdc actually said was : <PARA> o sometime around 1960 , simian virus 40 ( sv40 ) was discovered in the injected form of the polio vaccine ( ipv ). <PARA> o the sv40 virus has been found in certain types of cancer in humans . <PARA> o between 1955 and 1963 , when some portion of the ipv was contaminated with sv40 , roughly 98 million americans received at least one dose of polio vaccine . <PARA> clearly 98 million americans were not “ given [ a ] cancer virus via the polio shot ,” because not every single polio vaccination undertaken between the years of 1955 and 1963 involved vaccine contaminated with sv40 : the cdc estimated that somewhere between 10 and 30 million americans might have received sv40 - contaminated vaccine during that period . moreover , sv40 is not a “ cancer virus ,” and there is no definitive evidence that either sv40 itself or sv40 - contaminated polio vaccine causes ( or has caused ) cancer . <PARA> but even if the claim about the cdc ’ s hiding evidence of a link between polio vaccine and cancer held water , the short lead - in paragraph quoted above contains a number of credibility - related red flags regarding the cdc ’ s supposedly assuming its role as the perpetual villain of the anti - vaccine movement . america is not the world , and there ’ s no plausible reason to believe that the rest of the planet would be fleeced by one country ’ s public health authorities engaging in a conspiracy to deceive its people about vaccines . <PARA> moreover , the claim that the cdc had “ quickly ,” “ quietly ,” or “ recently ” redacted the information about a vaccine - cancer linkage was not new in october 2015 , as iterations of it had appeared as early as july 2013 . at that time health impact news published an article headlined “ cdc ‘ disappears ’ page linking polio vaccines to cancer - causing viruses ,” and infowars ‘ similar “ cdc sends fact sheet linking polio vaccine to cancer down the memory hole ” story reported : <PARA> that instance of the rumor claimed the pages had recently been deleted from google ’ s cache , but the site linked to archived version of the pages in question here and here . <PARA> the first link was titled “ cancer , simian virus 40 ( sv40 ), and polio vaccine fact sheet ” and was dated 22 october 2007 . if it was ( ostensibly ) deleted “ quickly ” and “ quietly ” by the cdc as some sort of a cover - up in 2013 , that would mean it still sat openly available for viewing by all and sundry online for roughly six years . the second link was titled “ frequently asked questions about cancer , simian virus 40 ( sv40 ), and polio vaccine ” and contained such clearly damning “ admissions ” as : <PARA> it should be noted that the study of sv40 with respect to cancer and polio vaccines is neither novel nor has in any way been suppressed : as the quoted portion above explained , the concern was identified and addressed prior to 1963 . a 2001 study indicated that “ large epidemiologic studies have not identified an elevated cancer risk in persons who received sv40 - contaminated vaccines [ administered before 1963 ]” and found “ no deaths due to tumors of the types putatively associated with sv40 .” the findings were described in that research as “ consistent with other negative epidemiologic investigations of risks from sv40 - contaminated vaccines ,” although further research was recommended . research published in 2004 echoed those findings : <PARA> nonetheless , anti - vaccine blogs and sites continually assert that the cdc has “ admitted ” or covered up information in a manner that relies on a relative lack of context on the part of the reader to spread . in this case , the rumor relied on the reader not knowing that sv40 concerns were well documented in medical literature and long considered resolved . by the same token , redaction conspiracies are primed to circulate in perpetuity each time the cdc is accused of newly “ burying ” information in a manner not immediately verifiable by site visitors ( i . e ., it ’ s difficult to corroborate information that has purportedly been deleted ). but concern over sv40 and vaccines was addressed and dealt with by 1963 , 50 years prior to the 2013 outbreak of the rumor . it was hardly an assertion revealed only by alternative health sites ’ crafty usage of google caching , and a multitude of studies combed through subsequent cancer rates to identify subsequent elevated risk . none was found , a fact which also was no secret and was long - documented . <PARA> moreover , the web documents the cdc was breathlessly accused of deleting were clearly marked “ last updated : 22 october 2007 ,” while cover - up accusations dated to july 2013 . far likelier than a conspiracy was the fact that the pages were last relevant and useful in october 2007 , and they ’ ve since been replaced with updated information hosted on separate pages at cdc . gov . in fact , a search for sv40 , polio , and cancer on the cdc web site returns a number of related links to cdc pages , inconsistent with claims the cdc has “ disappeared ” such information ( rather than replaced it with more current data ). the cached pages linked above still lead to dated information on cdc . gov , but none of it meaningfully conflicts with more up - to - date information about long - retired vaccine strains .

unproven	probably false <PARA> origins : in june 2015 , a screenshot of a facebook post began circulating on social media , featuring an image that appeared to depict a young black man named jammal longmire posing with two guns and issuing the above - quoted threat to police officers . <PARA> the appearance of the jammal longmire rumor coincided with a then - ongoing controversy over police treatment of a young black girl at a pool party in mckinney , texas , and most likely the image was created and / or garnered more attention due to what was at the time an ongoing race - related national debate . <PARA> purported screen captures of the post were shared to multiple social networks , with the original appearing to bear a date stamp of 8 june 2015 . a version published to facebook on 10 june 2015 was shared hundreds of thousands of times , and an 11 june 2015 tweet held that “ jammal longmire ” was an “ outspoken black lives matter activist ” ( a claim that apparently did not bear out , as we were unable to find a person of that name or likeness affiliated with the movement ): <PARA> the image certainly agitated social media users in a time of racial disharmony , and in subsequent months it continued to spread . yet apparently no trace of any jammal longmire existed on the internet before the rumor became popular : if longmire was an actual young man ( and prominent black lives matter activist ) living in america , he maintained a highly atypical non - existent profile on social media and the internet at large . some folks speculated that longmire concealed his accounts from view after the post went viral , but those subsequent actions couldn ’ t have retroactively eradicated all traces he would have left prior to 8 june 2015 . <PARA> a search for jammal longmire restricted to items appearing before 8 june 2015 turns up only misdated references posted after the emergence of the rumor , and we were unable to locate any other evidence pertaining to the existence of a person by that name prior to then . not only did longmire seem to spring into existence with a controversial claim on 8 june 2015 , but the words “ jammal ” and “ longmire ” didn ’ t appear consecutively at all on the internet before that time . <PARA> it ’ s possible ( though rather implausible ) longmire simply created a social media presence to post the image and make the threat and then disappeared back into the ether . however , national law enforcement agencies and daytona beach police treated reports about the post very seriously yet failed to to locate anyone remotely matching the name or photograph seen in the viral post . ( it should be noted that orlando television station wftv described the post as belonging to jammal longmire but clearly did not verify whether such an individual existed .) <PARA> none of the listed agencies turned up a jammal longmire in daytona beach or anywhere else . a longmire family was located in michigan but was deemed to be unrelated to the man in the controversial photographs . similarly , the educational institution whose name appeared on the shirt worn by the man in the photographs ( north carolina a & t state university ) was unable to find him : <PARA> some viewers observed that the firearms seen in the photograph were clearly corded as something being handled in a retail environment , some speculated they were attached to a video game , and others said they were secured in a fashion typically seen in gun stores . regardless , the guns visible in the photograph clearly didn ’ t belong to the individual holding them and may not even have been operational . <PARA> so while jammal longmire has remained a focus of social media outrage since june 2015 , neither local police , the fbi , nor the atf ( bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firearms and explosives ) were able to locate him or his corded guns . the longmire rumor or hoax was virtually identical to a similar racial controversy - based prank concerning a fictitious mcdonald ’ s employee named bubba conroy who purportedly spat in white customer ’ s meals . that claim also generated significant measures of outrage on social media sites but did not hold up under scrutiny . <PARA> originally published : 2 september 2015

false	origins : in april 2012 ( and again in august 2012 and december 2012 ) a photograph was widely circulated on the internet showing a dogfighting match taking place in a forum festooned with banners advertising heineken brand beer . many viewers assumed the photograph was evidence that heineken had officially sponsored the barbaric dogfighting event , leading to calls for <PARA> boycotts against the amsterdam - based company . <PARA> however , further investigation revealed that the photo had been taken back in 2010 at a nightclub in mongolia , and heineken had neither been aware of the dogfighting activity nor had it sponsored it . the club ’ s owner confirmed the heineken banners had been put up for a promotional event held at the club the night before and had not been removed by the time the dogfight took place the following day . <PARA> in response to the controversy , heineken announced that it had terminated its relationship with the club in question , removing all of its promotional materials and beverages from its premises , thereby “ ensuring our brands will not be available in the club again ”: <PARA> since this matter was brought to our attention via facebook we have conducted an investigation and now know that : <PARA> based on this we have taken the following immediate actions : <PARA> we want to thank our consumers on - line for bringing this issue to our attention . we are shocked and disappointed by these images . we fully understand the level of negative feeling amongst consumers based on what they have seen . we appreciate that the vast majority have asked for our point of view before making a judgment . we encourage our consumers to continue to use social media channels to alert us to any situation where they feel our brands are being misrepresented , so that we can take the appropriate actions . <PARA> heineken was the subject of a somewhat similar ( but smaller ) controversy in 2011 over objections to a television commercial that showed a heineken - drinking man attending a snake fight dressed in a snakeskin jacket :	
false	amid a then - current national debate over the confederate flag ( and its historical significance ) the web sites conservative post ( cp ) and joe for america published articles , both titled “ peanut butter and jelly deemed racist .” ( the former was published on 24 june 2015 , the latter on 25 june 2015 .) <PARA> examples : <PARA> in the context of a debate regarding the reclassification of common items as potentially racially offensive , the notion that something as harmless and american as peanut butter and jelly sandwiches could be next had a ring of truth to some unsettled americans . but extraordinary claims such as this require extraordinary substance to be considered credible , and this one had some glaring weaknesses . <PARA> conservativepost ‘ s article ( shared hundreds of thousands of times on facebook ) claimed : <PARA> the sole source for cp ‘ s claim was a piece published on a site called mr . conservative , which was itself sourced from an article published in 2013 . in fact , it wasn ’ t sourced so much as taken verbatim , as all three articles opened with identical admonishments that oprah ( long since retired from her network platform ) would be “ proud ” of the purported ban of pb & j . <PARA> as it turns out , the original source for the “ peanut butter sandwich ban ” was a portland tribune article published on 6 september 2012 . the entire rumor was predicated on the opening lines of that lengthy article , in which portland elementary school principal verenice gutierrez referenced the notion that students from different cultures don ’ t necessarily share the same frames of reference ( even in matters that might seem universally common and ordinary , such as sandwiches ), and educators should be aware of those kinds of issues : <PARA> unfortunately , since the article ’ s author ( not principal gutierrez ) used the word “ racism ” in the article ’ s opening line , this brief opening passage was taken out of context and spun into a claim that portland schools were seeking to “ ban ” peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for being “ racist .” <PARA> the claim really gained traction through an < a “ href =” <URL> target = bb > article published to the web site breitbart on 16 september 2012 . that article made the incredible leap of logic that since many portland school leaders had taken part in a “ week - long seminar on race ” conducted by the pacific educational group ( peg ), at a total cost of $ 526 , 901 , “ portland schools spent $ 500k to deem pb & j sandwiches racist ” — even though there was no tangible connection between the peg training and principal gutierrez ’ s remark to the portland tribune about peanut butter and jelly sandwiches , nor had gutierrez ( or anyone else in the portland school system ) actually referred to such sandwiches as “ racist .” <PARA> breitbart ‘ s version stripped away the context of the original portland tribune article and transmuted it into a sweeping , hyperbolic declaration that peanut butter and jelly sandwiches were about to be classified as a “ hate food ”: <PARA> from there , the grossly exaggerated repositioning made the short leap from “ portland schools classify peanut butter and jelly sandwiches as racist ” to the even more far - fetched “ portland schools ban peanut butter and jelly sandwiches because they ’ re racist .” <PARA> as noted , the portland tribune reporter who penned the original article ( not gutierrez ) was responsible for the turn of phrase “ the subtle language of racism .” gutierrez ’ s quoted remarks simply observed that children of different cultures might not eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches commonly , at home , and therefore might be more accustomed to different foods . not only was this brief remark made nearly three years prior to its circulation in 2015 , but it was broadly misconstrued as “ portland schools ban peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for being racist ” even though the remark in question in no way hinted at such a course of action .	
mixture	middle east today , middle america tomorrow . <PARA> origins : this item about home depot employees supposedly being forced to undergo ‘ muslim sensitivity training ’ due to demands by cair ( the council on american - islamic relations ) began as an article published on disreputable web sites in september 2014 . what it refers to is a press release issued by the michigan chapter of cair in march 2014 announcing that organization had recently provided cultural awareness training to employees at a home depot store in dearborn , michigan : <PARA> cair - mi executive director dawud walid and cair - mi safe spaces coordinator warda kalim discussed issues relating to customer interactions and modesty in islam and highlighted religious accommodations concerns of muslim employees . <PARA> cair - mi has provided similar trainings in the past to other home depot locations in southeastern michigan . <PARA> “ we welcome such opportunities to engage home depot and other business establishments to better serve their muslim customers and accommodate the cultural competency of their muslim employees ,” said cair - mi executive director dawud walid . <PARA> cair has helped resolve a number of similar cases involving prayer in the workplace and offers a booklet , called “ an employer ’ s guide to islamic religious practices ,” to help corporate managers gain a better understanding of islam and muslims . <PARA> contrary to the tenor of the item reproduced above , a representative from cair - mi told us that cair had not “ demanded ” that “ home depot ’ s employees be subjected to forced ‘ muslim cultural awareness sensitivity training '”; rather , cair provided basic cultural awareness training to some employees at a single home depot store in dearborn upon the request of that store ’ s management , and the request was not triggered by any complaint or incident occurring at that store . <PARA> dearborn has been referred to as “ america ’ s muslim capital ” and is home to a large arab - american population as well as the site of the largest mosque in the u . s . a third of dearborn ’ s population of 97 , 000 identifies as having arab heritage , a third of arab - americans in michigan are foreign born , and the arabic - speaking population in the state grew by 26 % from 2000 to 2010 , according to the arab american institute ( aai ). thus familiarity with the preferences and customs of the employee and customers bases in that area are an essential aspect of business operations : <PARA> the material used in that cultural awareness training , cair ’ s employer ’ s guide to islamic religious practices , is pretty basic stuff : a short guide to religiously - mandated practices of muslim employees that provides brief overviews of muslim holidays and the ramadan fast , the timing and observation of daily prayers ( and their effect on scheduling considerations for muslim employees ), muslim dietary and dress requirements , and a few other religiously related employment considerations ( e . g ., muslim employees should not be asked to serve or sell alcohol ).	
mixture	origins : on 15 july 2014 , the cincinnati television station wcpo ’ s news department conducted a melting test on several brands of ice cream ( a cup of haagen dazs , a klondike bar ice cream sandwich , and a walmart great value ice cream sandwich ) after receiving a tip that ice cream treats sold by walmart did not melt when left in the sun on a hot summer day : <PARA> “ i noticed that my son had left his ice cream sandwich outside ,” she said , “ and i was wondering ‘ why is there still ice cream in there ’?” <PARA> the walmart great value sandwich had barely melted 12 hours later ... even though it was an 80 degree morning . <PARA> “ i thought that ’ s quite weird ,” she said . “ so i looked at the box , and it doesn ’ t say artificial ice cream . it says ice cream .” <PARA> wcpo ’ s experiment , which has been reconstructed in countless youtube videos , found that walmart ’ s great value brand ice cream sandwich really did melt much much slower than its competitors ’ offerings : <PARA> when asked for comment about the seemingly never - melting ice cream sandwich , a walmart representative responded by noting that the melting rate of great value ice cream sandwiches is affected by the amount of cream they contain : <PARA> ( think of it this way : you can leave butter out for many days at room temperature , but it won ’ t melt into a puddle of liquid because it ’ s a dairy product containing a good deal of cream .) <PARA> virginia tech food chemist sean o ’ keefe confirmed <PARA> that fat can affect the rate at which an ice cream product will melt : the less fat ( and the more water ) in ice cream , the slower it melts . however , consumer reports found another reason to explain why walmart brand great value ice cream doesn ’ t melt so quickly as some others — stabilizers such as calcium sulfate and guar gum : <PARA> the fact that walmart great value brand ice cream seemingly doesn ’ t melt may unnerve some people , but all of the product ’ s ingredients have been deemed safe for consumption by the fda . and great value is not the only brand of ice cream product that contains such stabilizers .

mixture	partly true <PARA> origins : on the evening of 17 june 2015 , a mass shooting occurred at the emanuel african methodist episcopal church in downtown charleston , south carolina . nine of those in attendance were killed , including south carolina state senator rev . clementa c . pinckney . suspect dylann roof was arrested soon after the incident and charged with multiple counts of murder . <PARA> the tragedy prompted an outpouring of grief and debate on social media , and in its wake the image meme seen above and its backstory soon began to circulate widely online . according to the meme , a woman named jeanne assam was in attendance during a similar armed attack on a church but was able to shoot and wound the assailant , halting the attack . <PARA> the attack ultimately stopped by assam occurred in two phases in colorado on 9 december 2007 , starting at the youth with a mission ( ywam ) training center in arvada . at that location , shooter matthew murray killed two churchgoers and wounded two more before fleeing to the new life church in colorado springs . <PARA> at the second location , murray killed two more victims and wounded three others before jeanne assam , who was present at the church service taking place there , fired at murray and struck him several times , ending his assault . <PARA> however , jeanne assam wasn ’ t quite a random churchgoer who just happened to show up at the service fortuitously carrying a weapon that day , as implied by many online accounts of this incident . she was a former police officer and a volunteer church security guard who was aware of the earlier attack at the youth with a mission training center and had suggested that the new life church add extra security that day for that very reason : <PARA> jeanne assam herself to us that : <PARA> nonetheless , the official coroner ’ s ruling was that although assam had hit and wounded murray , the gunman ’ s fatal wound was a self - inflicted one : <PARA> shortly after the incident , assam was quoted as saying : <PARA> while assam was initially hailed as a hero for minimizing loss of life during the shooting at great personal risk , she later said she was asked to leave new life church because of her sexuality ( although the church disputed the claim ). <PARA> draper , electa . “ former minneapolis cop says ‘ god was with me ’ when she shot gunman in colorado church hallway .” denver post . 11 december 2007 . <PARA> hendrick , thomas . “ security guard : ‘ god guided me and protected me .'” denver post . 10 december 2007 . <PARA> noreen , barry . “ new life ’ s hero comes out — heroically .” colorado springs gazette . 24 february 2011 . <PARA> riccardi , nicholas and deedee correll . “ guard saved untold lives , officials say .” los angeles times . 11 december 2007 .

false	false <PARA> origins : a rumor has long been circulated on social media sites about a generous policy purportedly in place at all locations of the wendy ’ s fast food restaurant chain . according to that rumor , some form of corporate policy enables customers to obtain free food from any wendy ’ s outlet simply by informing an employee ( or the manager on duty ) that they ’ re from out of town and lack money . <PARA> iterations of this rumor have circulated since at least mid - 2012 ( seen in a facebook post and in the tweets embedded below ); but prior to that , the rumor apparently didn ’ t have much traction on the internet other than a yahoo ! answers entry posted sometime in 2009 : <PARA> <URL> although the origin of this belief is not precisely clear , it bears a strong resemblance to an older ( false ) legend that colonel sanders put a policy in place requiring all kentucky fried chicken outlets to provide a free meal to any broke and homeless person who entered one of his restaurants ( a requirement the post - sanders kentucky fried chicken company supposedly got out of by changing their name to kfc ). <PARA> a video uploaded to youtube on 25 january 2011 depicted a young man attempting ( and failing ) to obtain free food at wendy ’ s in the manner described . the individual who narrated the video cited a friend on xbox live as inspiration for the idea ; but he didn ’ t say whether he and his pal simply brainstormed to concoct ways to scam free food from restaurants or if they were acting on an already widespread belief that wendy ’ s in particular had a policy in place to feed stranded visitors : <PARA> this video was not youtube ’ s only evidence of a user attempting to hustle wendy ’ s for comped frosties . another young man tried his hand at the ruse in may 2013 , claiming success in the brief clip seen below . however , it should be noted that the wendy ’ s employee on the other end of the drive - thru speaker simply instructed him to drive up to the window and did not definitively state that any free food was on offer : <PARA> the claim has somewhat of a secret - handshake feel to it , perhaps in part because it ’ s an inherently unsustainable policy for any large chain to implement . should word get out that wendy ’ s staffers are obliged by the rules to feed all and sundry for free simply because they claim indigence , those in the know would soon outnumber paying customers . <PARA> ultimately , dreams of free food at wendy ’ s for all self - identified broke and disoriented travelers were officially dashed on 4 september 2013 : <PARA> <URL> it ’ s certainly possible that individual managers at wendy ’ s ( or any fast food restaurant ) have , on occasion , exercised discretion and supplied customers claiming to be broke and / or lost with food at no charge . however , that situation could easily occur spontaneously and irregularly at any establishment whose inventory and food cost accounting allowed for the occasional charitable freebie .

true	the 887 monolithic human figures carved from rock on easter island ( known as moai ) are familiar to many people through iconic images that show the statues to be either just heads or a combination of heads and shoulders only : <PARA> however , such pictures represent only a subset of the different forms in which the human figures on easter island appear . a combination of the popularity of the “ giant head ” images , the fact that the heads on the statues are disproportionately large in comparison to their bodies , and the circumstance that the bottoms of some of the statues are set deep into the ground where they are obscured from view has produced a widespread misconception that all of the easter island statues are nothing more than giant heads . many viewers are surprised , therefore , to learn the moai actually do have bodies : <PARA> additionally , the revelation that the statues have bodies is not a recent discovery , as suggested by the above example : many of the moai ( as shown above ) are situated fully above ground and displayed in their entirety , and some of the statues even sport arms and what appear to be red hats ( actually depictions of hair ): <PARA> in recent years the easter island statue project ( eisp ) has undertaken efforts to excavate and study some of the moai , thereby revealing previously hidden portions of the statues .

false	warnings about a new ambient threat targeting unwitting victims in day - to - day settings emerged in june 2015 , one popular version of which was published to twitter by the account <USER> this warning held that summer job interview ads for receptionists were actually a front for a human trafficking abduction scheme : <PARA> where <USER> sourced the message from was unclear , and neither the sender nor the recipient of the depicted text message was identified . that twitter account is quite popular ( with more than 1 . 3 million followers ), however , and is identified in its description as a “ parody account .” while some followers may have mistaken the tweet for a first - person tale , it was not : all the content on that particular timeline was aggregated from other sources . <PARA> the account ’ s owner likely received an impressive response to the human trafficking warning tweet above , as roughly an hour after posting it he tweeted a similar ( false ) warning about a shopper ’ s purported encounter with human traffickers in an oklahoma hobby lobby store . <PARA> so who is <USER> and why was he or she posting so many warnings about human trafficking ? a buzzfeed article published on 6 november 2014 (“ meet the network of guys making thousands of dollars tweeting as ‘ common white girls '”) identified him as cameron asa , a 21 - year - old college student from tennessee and revealed the purpose of asa ’ s mix of content : <PARA> in a ( somewhat amusing ) side - note , buzzfeed paraphrased a fellow twitter parody account operator who noted that “ targeting young girls with an account is a great market to try to tap into .” it seems targeting them to scare them about being targeted by criminals is a lucrative business , too . <PARA> to wit , asa shares content that is likely to be re - shared by his audience on twitter , and urban legends about human trafficking are clearly a big hit . so big , in fact , that his posted warning was almost immediately widely repeated as fact across twitter that same evening . by 2 june 2014 , the claim and attendant form letter arrived on facebook . a user in fresno , california , published a status update warning parents that that it was in actuality a front for human trafficking : <PARA> similar facebook posts targeted vector , a company that typically enlists teenagers to sell fancy knives door - to - door , as a human trafficking front : <PARA> as with the earlier text - in - a - tweet , users indeed shared these warnings . and as with several other similar viral claims , a number of factors converged to advance them quickly . <PARA> the first factor was the influx of college students to their hometowns seeking temporary summer employments as well as the notoriously aggressive recruiting methods of some door - to - door sales companies ( who ramp up their efforts to hire college students during summer break ). as a result , numerous college kids across the united states received unsolicited job or interview offers at the time of the circulating warning . many of them ( or their parents ) arrived at the intuitive conclusion : this is part of the human trafficking scheme we just read about on facebook ! <PARA> it seemed the breadth of social media couldn ’ t quite agree upon which opportunities were the riskiest . many on twitter believed cutco cutlery ( operating under the vector name ) was to blame , while others circulated a message implicating book sales company southwestern advantage in the kidnapping front ring warning . ( radio station kpsr in nixa , missouri , profiled the latter rumor on 4 june 2014 and found it to be without merit .) door - to - door sales jobs certainly generate a number of online complaints from disgruntled candidates , but those grievances generally comprise bait - and - switch job descriptions and high - pressure interview tactics . <PARA> a second aggravating factor concerned a persistent misconception about the risk factors involved in human trafficking . statistics clarifying the frequency with which adults are simply abducted against their will are notoriously hard to pin down ; enumerating particular cases correctly defined as “ human trafficking ” are even harder . however , a lack of corresponding news stories proportional to the rumors is telling : when any adult disappears under suspicious circumstances , the event is typically newsworthy and often widely reported . that ’ s not to say that individuals ( women in particular ) are never abducted and trafficked ; rather , that the avenues to activities commonly described as human trafficking are far less likely to be ( solicited or invitation - based ) job interviews than other means associated with the issue . <PARA> according to the non - governmental anti - trafficking organization the polaris project , human trafficking ( or sex trafficking ) in the united states is often a function of sex work . sex workers , teen runaways , and immigrants are most likely to be subject to the risk due in part to inherent expectations of intermittent absence or off - the - grid periods for those groups : <PARA> door - to - door sales warranted a mention by the polaris project on a separate page devoted to labor trafficking . however , that context did not involve a drugged bottle of water or one - time job interview , but instead encompassed a range of behaviors associated with longer - term coercive employment practices : <PARA> ( given that cutco / vector , the company identified in this warning , screens , hires , and trains contractors in groups , it ’ s unlikely that people could be abducted or made to disappear during the process without other prospective hires noticing that something unusual appeared to being on .) <PARA> finally , a 4 october 2013 article published by your houston news referenced humble , texas , in a story about human trafficking . that incident did not involve an interview for a door - to - door sales ( or any other job ), and it pertained to undocumented immigrants : <PARA> so while claims of human trafficking fronts were rampant as teens lined up for summer work in june 2015 , no substantive ( or even flimsy ) evidence supported such rumors . <PARA> it ’ s true that door - to - door sales jobs have generated online complaints ( and even , in rare instances , been linked with labor trafficking ), but the bulk of those comments pertained to the nature of the work . we were unable to locate any corresponding reports of drugged beverages supplied to job candidates , nor any disappearances that matched up with sales of knives or books by college kids . <PARA> although a single account involving human trafficking was reported in humble , texas , in 2013 , that incident appeared to have involved migrant workers and not college kids recruited for sales jobs .	
unproven	this story of a first meeting between two pen pals was widely circulated on the internet as a “ true story ” ( typically entitled “ the rose ”) beginning in 1996 . <PARA> it is , however , a work of fiction which was penned by s . i . kishor , originally published in a 1943 issue of collier ‘ s magazine under the title “ appointment with love .” ( the same story also appeared without attribution and with the characters ’ names slightly altered in the 1992 max lucado book and the angels were silent , and with appropriate credit in the 1996 collections a 3rd serving of chicken soup for the soul and stories for the heart .) <PARA> the tale ’ s huge cyberspatial appeal wasn ’ t difficult to comprehend : online friendships are formed sight unseen , and this process gives rise to quite understandable anxieties about the other person . questions of physical appeal aside , we ’ re left wondering whether the people we ’ re corresponding with are every bit as wonderful in real life , or whether they ’ re putting on a clever act and taking us in . this uncertainty leaves us with the uneasy feeling that although we think we know the other person , we ’ re never sure . a legend about this anxiety ’ s being faced and the situation ’ s working out in fairy tale fashion therefore falls upon many very receptive ears . <PARA> this is a touching tale , one that tries to convey an admirable moral about personality and character outshining physical beauty , but many readers find it a bitterly ironic piece that actually delivers the opposite message . note the man ’ s reaction upon his deciding to approach the woman he presumed to be hollis : “ this would not be love , but it would be something precious , something perhaps even better than love , a friendship for which he had been and must ever be grateful .” on the strength of their correspondence , this man had fantasized a budding romance ; upon catching sight of his pen pal , he promptly discarded any such notion . his decision was made purely on the basis of the woman ’ s physical appearance : he wrote her off as a romantic partner without so much as first speaking to her . <PARA> society places a premium on attractiveness , and as much as we decry the unfairness of this valuation , we often ( unwittingly or otherwise ) reinforce it . many readers take in this story as a touching romantic tale , one whose denoument feels right in that the soldier who greeted the older woman instead of running away was rewarded with the pretty girl he ’ d ached for . but if we truly believed the love of a good woman was its own best reward and that looks didn ’ t matter , we should be rooting for the hero to walk past the comely blonde almost without seeing her in his haste to reach the woman he ’ d lost his heart to . were love the important thing , we ’ d have been quite happy to have the 40 - ish , frumpy woman turn out to be the real hollis and for the story to end with the two lovers walking away arm in arm . instead , the soldier has to fight a moral battle within himself , and readers are touched by his ending up with not just love but beauty , too . <PARA> what ’ s wrong with the unintended message of this short story is perhaps best expressed through a rewrite of it penned by james a . whitney . in that version , we see into the heart of the woman who waits . ( if you thought the original was touching , you ’ ll find tears in your eyes by the time you finish this one .) <PARA> in the autumn of 1998 , an updated version of this tale appeared in the little - known “ true life stories ” magazine for me . in that modern retelling , gwen and brian meet in an internet chat room for writers , and the denouement takes place at the airport in sydney , australia . thought the story has been moved forward fifty years , there ’ s the same refusal to swap photos , same yellow rose , same old lady to direct the hero to where his beautiful lady love awaits him . <PARA> the fable of a young man who is paired by circumstance with an unattractive woman , who shows her kindness nonetheless , and who is rewarded for his gallantry by ending up with a beautiful young woman is far from a new one . one of the arthurian legends ( mid - 15th century ) has king arthur tricked by an evil knight into having to solve an impossible riddle : what do women most want ? an old hag finally offers the one true answer ( what she wants is her own way ), but her price is one of arthur ’ s knights as a husband . sir gawain and the hag are duly churched , and this flower of knighthood treats the old woman well despite her huge floppy ears , wrinkled skin , and bleary eyes . <PARA> on their wedding night the crone transforms into a beautiful maiden only to pose this question : would sir gawain prefer she be beautiful by day or by night ? unwilling to dictate the fate of another , he tells her such an important decision has to be her choice , thereby demonstrating that he has learned the value of treating women as people , not property . the lovely maiden announces that this was the last test and that he ’ d passed . now , she would be beautiful all the time , forever and ever . gawain ’ s gallantry and understanding are rewarded in classic fashion . <PARA> early expressions of the “ loathly hag ” theme ( as this motif is known ) are found in chaucer ’ s canterbury tales ( in the “ wife of bath ’ s tale ”) and john gower ’ s 1386 tale of florent .	
mixture	on 15 january 2015 , msn republished a parent society article entitled “ finally ! the fda admits that nearly over 70 % of u . s . chickens contain cancer - causing arsenic .” this article circulated widely following its republication on a well - trafficked , popular website and caused widespread concern on social media sites about the current safety of commercially produced chicken products . <PARA> according to the article , the u . s . food and drug administration had recently announced “ nearly over 70 %” [ sic ] of chicken sold for human consumption in the united states contained a known carcinogen , arsenic : <PARA> the first paragraph of that article stated an fda announcement regarding arsenic in chicken had been reported in the news “ a few days ago ,” but in fact that news had been reported several years earlier ( as related in an 8 june 2011 wall street journal piece , “ pfizer to stop sale of animal drug ,” linked from that article ). what was reported at the time was that a single study of 100 chickens had found chickens who ate feed containing roxarsone ( an arsenic - containing additive used to kill parasites and promote growth ) did not eliminate as much inorganic arsenic through waste as previously thought and therefore had higher levels of inorganic arsenic in their livers than chickens who had not been fed roxarsone . <PARA> although the fda stressed “ the amount [ of arsenic ] is too tiny to be dangerous to people who eat it ,” pfizer , the manufacturer of roxarsone , announced it would discontinue sales of that feed additive : <PARA> the fda clarified its decision at length on their web site back in 2011 , long prior to the january 2015 circulation of the rumor :	
false	if it ’ s real it ’ s dynamite ! she ’ s a life member of the nra yet is at a pool where guns and alcohol are mixed . american legion / vfw frown on garments made from us flag . <PARA> origins : it ’ s <PARA> an unfortunate aspect of modern life that just about any woman who enters the public sphere at a national level <PARA> is presumed to have posed for risqué photographs ( anything from cheesecake shots to nude pictures ) at some point in her past , and that ( whether she has or not ) examples of such photos will inevitably be fabricated and put on public display . <PARA> alaska governor sarah palin quickly became the object of such attention when senator john mccain selected her as his running mate for the 2008 presidential election . the image displayed above , of a bikini - wearing , rifle - toting sarah palin , began circulating on the internet within days of the announcement that she had been tapped for the vice - presidential spot on the 2008 republican ticket . it ’ s purely a digital manipulation , however , created by pasting an image of her head onto this original photo ( of a bikini - clad woman holding a bb gun , not a rifle ): <PARA> another widely circulated photograph was this putative pose of sarah palin in a short skirt and high heels ( which was also fashioned as a playboy magazine cover ): <PARA> it , too , was a fake , one similarly created by clipping the head of sarah palin from the photograph below and pasting it onto someone else ’ s body shot : <PARA> likewise , much attention was paid to a supposed nude shot of a much younger sarah palin , seen at the bottom center of this chinese newspaper article : <PARA> this picture was a double fake . it ’ s not a photograph of sarah palin ; it ’ s an image that has long been circulated as a picture of seinfeld actress julia <PARA> louis - dreyfuss . even that attribution is wrong , <PARA> however , as the picture was fabricated by pasting the actress ’ face onto someone else ’ s body .	
false	shortly after ireland became the first nation to legalize gay marriage by popular vote , new yorker humorist andy borowitz posted a satirical story to his facebook page positing that louisiana governor bobby jindal had broken off trade relations with the lgbt - friendly country : <PARA> while many people know andy borowitz as a humor writer for the new yorker , the above - displayed article did not appear in the popular journal ; instead , it was posted to the writer ’ s facebook page . this may have made it more difficult for some readers to determine whether or not it was real . <PARA> regardless of where it first appeared , there is no truth to this story . in addition to the fact that no legitimate news outlets have covered governor bobby jindal ’ s alleged decision to cut off trade relations with ireland , the nature of mr . borowitz ’ s articles can be determined by looking at subjects he has previously essayed , which include fact - resistant humans , china ’ s buying texas , and tom brady ’ s mandatory season with the new york jets .	
false	false <PARA> origins : on 27 may 2015 , the unreliable , clickbaiting political aggregation site american news published an article titled “ breaking : obama admits to forging birth certificate after this old photo leaks to the public ,” which included a purported quote from president obama about his true ( i . e ., non - u . s .) place of origin : <PARA> it didn ’ t take much digging to locate the source of american news ‘ s report , which was a 26 september 2014 article published by empire news , one of five of the most egregious fake news sites on the internet . american news , as is their style , simply excerpted portions of empire news ‘ fake article , slapped a clickbaiting headline on it , and attached a completely unrelated photograph ( a picture of barack obama ’ s kindergarten class at noelani elementary school in hawaii ) to it . <PARA> the item was not even the first “ barack obama birth certificate forgery ” fake news article that american news stole from another site . they previously ran a wholly fictitious birther yarn from another fake news site , world news daily report . <PARA> originally published : 27 may 2015	
mixture	is this true ? <PARA> origins : recents months have seen efforts by lawmakers in several states to limit what recipients of food stamps and other forms of public assistance may purchase with those benefits . for example , a member of the missouri legislature introduced a bill that would bar recipients of supplemental nutrition assistance programs ( snap ) from using their benefits to purchase cookies , chips , energy drinks , seafood or steak . and kansas passed a law prohibiting recipients of temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) funds from spending those monies on a variety of goods and services : <PARA> no tanf cash assistance shall be used to purchase alcohol , cigarettes , tobacco products , lottery tickets , concert tickets , professional or collegiate sporting event tickets or tickets for other entertainment events intended for the general public or sexually oriented adult materials . no tanf cash assistance shall be used in any retail liquor store , casino , gaming establishment , jewelry store , tattoo parlor , massage parlor , body piercing parlor , spa , nail salon , lingerie shop , tobacco paraphernalia store , vapor cigarette store , psychic or fortune telling business , bail bond company , video arcade , movie theater , swimming pool , cruise ship , theme park , dog or horse racing facility , parimutuel facility , or sexually oriented business or any retail establishment which provides adult - oriented entertainment in which performers disrobe or perform in an unclothed state for entertainment , or in any business or retail establishment where minors under age 18 are not permitted . <PARA> similarly , in may 2015 , the wisconsin state assembly passed a bill ( assembly bill 177 ) that would require those who receive food stamps to spend at least two - thirds of their benefits on foodstuffs designated by the state as nutritional items . the list of allowed nutritional items includes meat , fish , fresh produce , and white potatoes , but specifically excludes food stamps from being used for purchases of crab , lobster , shrimp , or any other shellfish : <PARA> under this bill , dhs must require that not less than 67 percent of the snap benefits used by a recipient in a month be used to purchase any of the following foods : foods that are on the list of foods authorized for the federal special supplemental nutrition program for women , infants , and children ( wic foods ); beef ; pork ; chicken ; fish ; fresh produce ; and fresh , frozen , and canned white potatoes . in addition , dhs must prohibit using snap benefits for the purchase of crab , lobster , shrimp , or any other shellfish . <PARA> the larger list of allowed foodstuffs excludes such items as white potatoes , nuts , cranberry sauce , popsicles , spaghetti sauce , soup , ketchup , pickles , baked beans , flavored peanut butter , flavored milk , and brown eggs . <PARA> contrary to various inaccurate headlines , however , the proposed law ( if fully passed and enacted as law ) would not “ ban ” food stamp recipients from purchasing these food items ; rather , it would restrict them from spending more than one - third of their snap benefits on such foodstuffs . it ’ s also unlikely the bill will be codified as law , as it would require a federal waiver that no state has ever received : <PARA> because food stamp benefits are funded by the federal government , the state would need to obtain a federal waiver in order to impose restrictions on food purchases . <PARA> no state has received such a waiver , but rep . brooks said he believes his bill is less restrictive than some proposed in other states and has a better chance of being implemented . <PARA> no state has received such a waiver , but rep . brooks said he believes his bill is less restrictive than some proposed in other states and has a better chance of being implemented . <PARA> proponents of the bill argue that it would promote healthier eating habits which would benefit both food stamp recipients and taxpayers : <PARA> republican lawmakers who have pushed the proposal during the current legislative session and in the past say they aren ’ t trying to “ stigmatize ” or “ shame ” the about 856 , 000 people who participate in wisconsin ’ s food stamp program , which is called foodshare . <PARA> they argue that limiting the purchase of junk food promotes healthy eating , reduces unspecified “ abuses ” and benefits society in the long run . <PARA> “ there is a direct financial benefit not just to the individual , which of course is obvious to have better health , but also to state taxpayers and society as a whole ,” said assembly speaker robin vos . <PARA> they argue that limiting the purchase of junk food promotes healthy eating , reduces unspecified “ abuses ” and benefits society in the long run . <PARA> “ there is a direct financial benefit not just to the individual , which of course is obvious to have better health , but also to state taxpayers and society as a whole ,” said assembly speaker robin vos . <PARA> oppoents , however , contend that the bill would neither promote healthier eating nor reduce fraud : <PARA> but democrats say the bill would [ stigmatize and shame ] and that current perceptions about abuse of the system are based on nothing but anecdotal evidence . <PARA> “ it ’ s a restriction that ’ s designed just to make the lives of those that are already struggling that much harder ,” said rep . lisa subeck . “ and instead , we should be focusing not on the foods people buy but on putting people to work by creating jobs that get people off of foodshare .” <PARA> to illustrate democrats ’ opposition , rep . evan goyke held a platter of four wisconsin cheeses . <PARA> all four were cheddar . one was shredded and three were in block form . three displayed flags that said “ gop prohibited .” one flag said “ gop approved .” <PARA> the approved cheese was a block of mild cheddar . two sharp cheddars — one shredded and one block — were not approved . one mild cheddar was not approved because it was too large , goyke said . <PARA> “ the stated goals of this bill are nutrition and fraud ,” said rep . mark spreitzer . “ when you look at something like this cheese plate , there ’ s no evidence of sharp cheddar fraud . people are not buying sharp cheddar in order to defraud foodshare , and there ’ s no nutritional difference . so if those are the stated goals , the bill is not accomplishing either .” <PARA> “ it ’ s a restriction that ’ s designed just to make the lives of those that are already struggling that much harder ,” said rep . lisa subeck . “ and instead , we should be focusing not on the foods people buy but on putting people to work by creating jobs that get people off of foodshare .” <PARA> to illustrate democrats ’ opposition , rep . evan goyke held a platter of four wisconsin cheeses . <PARA> all four were cheddar . one was shredded and three were in block form . three displayed flags that said “ gop prohibited .” one flag said “ gop approved .” <PARA> the approved cheese was a block of mild cheddar . two sharp cheddars — one shredded and one block — were not approved . one mild cheddar was not approved because it was too large , goyke said . <PARA> “ the stated goals of this bill are nutrition and fraud ,” said rep . mark spreitzer . “ when you look at something like this cheese plate , there ’ s no evidence of sharp cheddar fraud . people are not buying sharp cheddar in order to defraud foodshare , and there ’ s no nutritional difference . so if those are the stated goals , the bill is not accomplishing either .”

false	this guy was told by his homeowners association that he couldn ’ t fly the american flag in his yard ... <PARA> origins : recent years have seen a number of “ viral ” news stories about homeowners ( often military personnel or veterans ) who have run afoul of local ordinances or homeowners association ( hoa ) rules that <PARA> prevented them from displaying u . s . flags on their property , such as the 2009 case of van t . barfoot and the 2013 case of brandon weir . usually such problems arise not because of a general prohibition on the flying of u . s . flags , but because some facet of a particular flag ’ s display violates an existing rule : the flag is too large , the flagpole from which it is flown is too high , or the flag is attached to a portion of a home ( such as a balcony or stairway ) which is required to be kept free from adornment . <PARA> in may 2013 a photograph ( displayed above ) of a home with its exterior painted in the pattern of an american flag ( white stars amidst a blue field adjacent to red and white horizontal striping ) was circulated on the internet , with accompanying text identifying the paint scheme as one the homeowner resorted to after being told by his hoa “ that he couldn ’ t fly the american flag in his yard .” although the picture is real and the unusual paint job it depicts was something undertaken as a form of protest , the true backstory had nothing to do with a homeowner ’ s being barred from displaying a u . s . flag in his yard . <PARA> the american flag house pictured above is located in cambridge , maryland , and its owner , branden spear , gave it that distinctive paint job after being angered that his restored victorian property was declared by building inspectors to be non - compliant with historical code : <PARA> homeowners who choose to paint their houses with non - traditional colors risk running afoul of their neighbors and local politicians , but owner and contractor branden spear never set out to paint his restored victorian properties with colors that were out of the norm . but when local building inspectors told him that the windows he chose to restore the home weren ’ t up to historical code , he got angry . “ it would have cost one - third of the restoration budget just to install those windows ,” says spear . then he realized the building code said nothing about what colors the old victorians should be painted . so as a show of his anger , and as a protest against what he says are unfair regulations , he painted one home all black , and the adjacent home with an american flag theme . they ’ ve become something of a tourist attraction since , and even though spear is still at odds with local government officials , he has proven one point — that paint and color can also be used as protest . <PARA> in june 2014 , florida news outlets reported a case of a resident of bradenton who had also painted his house in the style of a u . s . flag as a protest over the city ’ s code compliance enforcement : <PARA> a prestigious road in bradenton is now home to a very patriotic house . <PARA> brent greer , who lives on riverview boulevard , recently painted the outside of his house red , white and blue . greer said he decided to turn his home into the american flag to send a message . <PARA> greer grew up in the 100 -

mixture	the challenge was to design a vertical structure on the island of cotonduba that in addition to serving as an observation tower would become a symbol of welcome to newcomers in rio either by sea or by air once it has been host city of 2016 olympic games . <PARA> designed by rafa firm headquartered in zurich , switzerland , it is called “ solar city tower ”, this structure was chosen in response to the initial proposal and it has the potential to generate enough energy not only for the olympic city , but also for part of the city of rio . <PARA> its design makes it store solar energy during the day , while the surplus energy produced is piped to pump sea water within the tower giving the effect of a waterfall outside . this water is reused simultaneously by turbines which are designed to produce energy during the night <PARA> these characteristics give it the epithet tower generator which is intended as a continuation of some of the resolutions taken during the earth summit united nations in 1992 that took place in rio and also promotes the use of natural resources in energy among these people . <PARA> at the top of the tower , it will be possible to appreciate the scenery around the island where it will be erected and its waterfall will become a benchmark for 2016 and the city of rio de janeiro . <PARA> origins : the text accompanying the images displayed above describes them as picturing a vertical structure to be built on cotonduba island , which would offer the aesthetic function of providing a striking welcoming signal to guests arriving in rio de janeiro for the 2016 summer olympics , as well as the practical functions of serving as an observation tower and storing solar energy ( the latter to be used in part to pump water used to create the waterfall effect on the structure ’ s exterior ). <PARA> however , these pictures are just conceptual images ; what they depict hasn ’ t yet been built , may never be built , and hasn ’ t yet been demonstrated to be technically feasible . they come from the web site of rafaa , a zurich - based architecture and design studio , which submitted them in 2009 as its proposal for a design competition . rafaa described the concept behind its “ solar city tower ” design thusly : <PARA> the aim of this project is to ask how the classic concept of a landmark can be reconsidered . it is less about an expressive , iconic architectural form ; rather , it is a return to content and actual , real challenges for the imminent post - oil - era . this project represents a message of a society facing the future ; thus , it is the representation of an inner attitude . our project , standing in the tradition of “ a building / city as a machine ,” shall provide energy both to the city of rio de janeiro and its citizens while using natural resources . we hope to attain an international olympic message with a political appeal . after hosting the united nation ’ s earth summit in 1992 , rio de janeiro will once again be the starting point for a global green movement and for a sustainable development of urban structures . it will perhaps even become a symbol for the first zero carbon footprint olympic games . <PARA> the project consists of a solar power plant that by day produces energy for the city respectively the olympic village . excessive energy will be pumped as seawater <PARA> into a tower . by night , the water can be released again ;

true	origins : on 12 april 2015 , a 25 - year - old man named freddie gray sustained grave injuries ( from which he subsequently died ) while in police custody in baltimore . although details about gray ’ s arrest , custody , and death are still unclear , some aspects of the case have come to light . <PARA> on 27 april 2015 , the web site heavy published an article that included gray ’ s arrest record , as follows : <PARA> although many other publications have presented the above - displayed arrest record as revelatory information , freddie gray ’ s rap sheet has in fact been frequently discussed by the mainstream media . <PARA> for example , cnn obtained court documents showing more than 20 criminal court cases in maryland against gray ; the baltimore sun combed through gray ’ s arrest record and determined that most of his arrests were for possession of or intent to sell drugs other than marijuana ; and the associated press concluded that gray had been “ in and out of prison for several drug convictions in baltimore ” since 2008 : <PARA> he also faced drug charges that were scheduled for trial in april and may . he has been found guilty of drug charges in the past ; his sentences were unclear from court records . <PARA> freddie gray ’ s rap sheet is also a matter of public record and is available via the maryland department of justice web site . <PARA> it should also be noted that the above - displayed list shows freddie gray ’ s arrest record and not his conviction record : <PARA> court records show not - guilty verdicts , cases dropped , closed or put on the inactive docket . there ’ s one “ probation after conviction ” for a drug charge last august . those are pretty typical outcomes for someone police frequently suspect of being a street - level drug dealer . <PARA> freddie gray ’ s arrest record included charges of second - degree assault , distribution of marijuana , and illegal gambling . while many of the charges levied against gray have already seen their day in court , the final item on gray ’ s record , a possession charge from march 2015 , was “ abated by death .”	
false	what is actor michael j . fox ’ s middle name ? is it justin ? jackson ? how about jazzhands ? the answer to the question of exactly what that initial stands for has proved elusive to many of his fans , allowing for the rise of a strange rumor : michael fox ’ s parents allowed him to choose his own middle name , so when he was six years old he opted to honor his favorite dessert and become michael jello fox : <PARA> the exact origins of this rumor are unclear ( it ’ s probably an escapee from one of the plethora of fake “ did you know ?” factoid lists that have long circulated online ), but the unusual claim has been posted to multiple internet forums over the years . <PARA> although the details of the story change depending upon the source , the basic premise of the rumor was provided during a 2008 “ off - topic ” discussion on the rotten tomatoes film site about middle names : <PARA> curiously , expressions of this rumor have also made their way into some online sales listings for the back to the future dvd : <PARA> ( this note is also wrong in stating that back to the future had its theatrical release in 1990 . the second sequel , back to the future iii , opened in 1990 , but the original movie first hit theaters in 1985 ). <PARA> okay , so what is michael j . fox ’ s real middle name ? the correct answer is ... wait for it ... “ andrew .” <PARA> huh ? how is that possible ? <PARA> according to a brief biography from the michael j . fox foundation , the actor was born michael andrew fox in 1961 to parents william and phyllis fox in edmonton , alberta . the actor explained in his autobiography lucky man : a memoir that it wasn ’ t until he had to register for the screen actors guild ( sag ) that he decided to use a different middle initial for his professional name , due to industry requirements for unique stage identifiers : <PARA> in terms of birth names , michael j . fox ’ s middle name is therefore andrew . in terms of stage names , his middle name is , like that of president harry s . truman , simply an initial that stands for nothing in particular .

false	origins : on 30 march 2014 , wyoming ’ s yellowstone park was struck by a 4 . 8 magnitude quake , the most powerful earthquake to hit that area since 1980 . in conjunction with that earthquake ( and again in april 2015 , after reports of the discovery of a giant magma reservoir under yellowstone hit the news ), videos were posted online showing animals such as buffalo seemingly “ running for their lives ” to leave the park : <PARA> this phenomenon of apparently fleeing animals has been claimed by many observers as a sign foretelling the imminent eruption of yellowstone ’ s “ supervolcano ”: <PARA> yellowstone national park , wyoming : could the supervolcano which has been dormant for the past 650 , 000 years be ready to erupt again ? <PARA> if you listen to some animal experts , that answer is a definitive “ yes ”. <PARA> recall , if you will , the tsunami in late 2006 . do you remember reports that animals were escaping and running for higher ground hours before the waves hit ?

in nature ’ s can animals predict disaster ?, for instance , one geologist <PARA> says he sees an increasing number of missing pets documented in the local classified ads just before an earthquake strikes in california . he , in fact , predicted the famous san francisco earthquake of 1989 . the theory is that the animals are fleeing the impending quake . <PARA> again , other scientists doubt this . usgs scientists , for instance , say even simple science fair projects will show little statistical association . <PARA> similarly , scientists are skeptical that any special “ sixth sense ” helped animals survive the great tsunami that swept the indian ocean in 2004 . after the wave , people reported seeing animals fleeing to forests on high ground and finding few bodies of dead animals . but scientists note that little hard data exists , and that many animals may have survived simply because they are strong swimmers or able to scamper up trees . <PARA> we should be careful not to give animals super - powers , says whit gibbons , an ecologist at the university of georgia . “ i always like stories of animals outsmarting humans , [ but ] i really don ’ t think animals have any special powers beyond those that help them in their daily lives ,” writes gibbons . “ i do not doubt that many animals detect certain natural signals , such as the early tremblings of an earthquake , long before humans . this means they have opportunity to react before we can . but to think they are reacting any differently from someone who runs for an exit at a shout of ‘ fire ’ is to give wildlife more credit than is deserved .” <PARA> what about other animal trends ?

false	origins : diet soft drinks are another household product so ubiquitous that few of us recall a time when they were not a firmly - established item of consumer culture . nonetheless , they ’ re older than most of us probably think , having originated in the 1950s , an era in which americans were noted far more for enjoying the affluence and prosperity of post - war life than for being particularly health - conscious . <PARA> royal crown cola ( formerly nehi ) takes credit for the invention of the first diet soft drink with its development of diet - rite cola in 1958 , but back then , when diet sodas comprised less than 1 % of soft drink sales , diet - rite was marketed only on a limited basis as a special dietary product . as the 1950s waned <PARA> into the 1960s , however , “ the bulging waistline and middle - age spread ” took on “ the proportion of a national disaster ,” consumers ( particularly women ) became more calorie - conscious , and a prominent survey indicated that 28 % of the population was watching its weight . when royal crown began to promote diet - rite cola nationally as a soft drink ( rather than as a dietary product ) in 1961 , the race was on . <PARA> major soft drink companies had initially eschewed diet sodas for fear of injuring their existing business in sugary drinks , but by the early 1960s the diet drink market had grown sufficiently large that they could no longer ignore it . in 1962 , coca - cola launched a crash program code - named “ project alpha ” to develop a competing diet cola and bring it to market in less than a year . the goal was to produce a low - calorie cola drink using saccharin and cyclamates instead of sugar while avoiding the typically unpleasant aftertaste that plagued other diet sodas . coca - cola met its goal with the introduction of tab in may 1963 , a diet cola advertised with the slogan “ how can one calorie taste so good ?” and notable for its stylized logo , the unusual capitalization of its name (“ tab ” rather than “ tab ” or “ tab ”), and its distinctively textured bottled . ( tab was not technically a coca - cola product : it was marketed through coca - cola ’ s subsidiary fanta beverage company .) <PARA> but why “ tab ”? the name doesn ’ t conjure up images of something delicious and refreshing to drink ( one couldn ’ t even guess from the name that this product was something to drink ), nor does it suggest something that would appeal to health - conscious , calorie - counting consumers . if anything , what the word “ tab ” was likely to bring to the minds of american audiences in the early 1960s was a key on a typewriter , or possibly actor tab hunter . given the seeming lack of relevance of the name , and the fact that tab was a cola drink developed from scratch in a matter of months ( rather than one based on a formula that had evolved over many decades , as coca - cola and pepsi - cola were ), one might find plausible the claim that “ tab ” ( capitalization notwithstanding ) was an acronym for “ totally artificial beverage .” as usual , though , the real story is rather more mundane . <PARA> when tab was introduced , coca - cola was not about to dilute the tremendous value of its brand name by identifying as “ coke ” something that was distinctively not coca - cola , so suggestions that the new drink be called diet coke were dismissed as “ heresy ” by <PARA> coca - cola president j . paul austin . ( an ad man at mccann - erickson , coca - cola ’ s advertising agency , supposedly quipped that “ if god had wanted coca - cola to have saccharin in it , he would have made it that way in the first place .”) <PARA> agreeing that the name of their new diet soda should be short and easy to remember , coca - cola had their ibm 1401 mainframe programmed to spit out a list of about 2300 , 000 names using four - letter combinations . after winnowing out names considered unsuitable for one reason or another ( such as unpronounceability or similarity to existing product names or trademarks ), coca - cola narrowed down the list to about 600 choices ; further refinement produced a set of about two dozen prospective names which were put before the public in marketing tests . “ tab ” emerged as the eventual winner , supposedly because that named appealed to consumers as suggestive they were “ keeping tab ” on their weight problems . <PARA> packaging designer robert sidney dickens inc . gave the beverage name its familiar capitalization pattern (“ tab ”) in the logo they designed for the drink . the initial idea was to render the name tab in all uppercase block letters , but dickens felt that exaggerating the top arm of the “ t ” would make the name more memorable , so the “ a ” was reduced to lower case to allow more horizontal room but was heavily swirled to still grab viewer attention . <PARA> tab has changed a bit since the early 1960s : a small amount of sugar was added in 1969 after cyclamates were banned in the united states , caffeine - free tab was introduced in 1983 , a saccharin - aspartame version of the tab formula was produced in 1984 , and coca - cola even tried to neutralize competing crystal pepsi with tab clear in the 1990s . <PARA> tab was largely supplanted by diet coke in the 1980s and became increasingly difficult to find . ( indeed , one has to do a fair bit of searching to locate any information about the original tab beverage on coca - cola ’ s web site these days .) however , in 2006 coca - cola brought the brand name back to prominence by introducing tab energy , a product touted as a “ low - cal energy drink ,” and <PARA> if tab fans can ’ t find the original soda at their local stores , they can always order it through online vendors .	
false	origins : in april 2015 , an image urging viewers to share a photograph of a baby born with his heart outside his body in order raise funds for his medical care was circulated widely via facebook . but neither the image nor its claim was new ; the tandem was simply a reiteration of a hoax that had circulated more than a year earlier involving the same photograph and plea . <PARA> this “ raise money for a child ’ s medical care by sharing this photo on facebook ” format of hoax is common : previous variations include a child purportedly shot by a family member , a toddler who needed <PARA> a heart transplant , and a little girl from poland in desperate need of money for burn treatment . <PARA> as is often the case with these popular social media hoaxes , the image used was one of a real child suffering a real medical condition , and that image was deliberately selected with the intent of tugging at the heartstrings of facebook users for purposes unconnected to the depicted child ’ s recovery or well being . <PARA> the photograph used in this case is one that was widely reproduced in conjunction with 2012 news coverage about the case of hayes davis , who was born with omphalocele , a birth defect in which the fetus ’ intestines and other abdominal organs stick out from the belly button : <PARA> after a pregnancy with seemingly endless appointments and ultrasounds , [ kelly ] davis gave birth to hayes march 25 , 2011 , via cesarean section at children ’ s memorial hermann hospital in houston , tx . <PARA> “ i was so excited to meet him , but the anxiety was almost overwhelming ,” the new mom said . “ i didn ’ t know if he would breathe on his own or eat on his own or whether the omphalocele would stay intact .” <PARA> “ i was so excited to meet him , but the anxiety was almost overwhelming ,” the new mom said . “ i didn ’ t know if he would breathe on his own or eat on his own or whether the omphalocele would stay intact .” <PARA> in january 2012 , doctors successfully corrected davis ’ condition : <PARA> after his mom spent months treating the condition and even documenting her world on her blog , “ o baby ,” hayes underwent surgery to correct the organs . <PARA> “ the surgery went perfectly ,” davis said . “ both surgeons were incredibly pleased . we ’ re looking forward to a simpler way of life .” <PARA> “ the surgery went perfectly ,” davis said . “ both surgeons were incredibly pleased . we ’ re looking forward to a simpler way of life .” <PARA> images such as the one of the “ baby born with his heart outside his body ” are carefully selected by facebook scammers preying on the sympathies of social media users . <PARA> many folks believe that sharing the image is harmless : if the claim is true , the baby is helped ; and if it ’ s false , only a small amount of their time was wasted . but these types of hoaxes are typically lures for the distribution of malware as well as clickjacking , clickbaiting , and like - farming activities , made all the more reprehensible for their dishonest and unauthorized use of such photographs . <PARA> in any case , facebook does not directly donate money based upon likes or shares generated for any purpose . facebook ’ s advice for charitable giving on the social network can be found here .

unproven	origins : one of the ( admittedly minor ) issues that has vexed the american media and government alike is how to refer to the infamous jihadist / extremist group most commonly known as isis ( for islamic state of iraq and syria ) or isil ( islamic state of iraq and the levant ): <PARA> naming the islamic state has proved a problem for many organizations since the sunni islamist extremist group gained traction in iraq this year . at first , many referred to it as the islamic state of iraq and syria or the acronym isis . however , due to differences over how the name should be translated from its arabic original , the u . s . government and some others referred to them as isil . <PARA> the group later announced that it should simply be called the “ islamic state ” — a reference to the idea that the group was breaking down state borders to form a new caliphate — and many media organizations began to refer to them this way . that in turn led to some complications : islamic clerics around the world expressed anger at the extremist group being used to portray all of islam , and requested that it be called by another name ( a group of british imams suggested calling it the “ un - islamic state ,” arguing that it was “ neither islamic , nor is it a state ”). <PARA> the group later announced that it should simply be called the “ islamic state ” — a reference to the idea that the group was breaking down state borders to form a new caliphate — and many media organizations began to refer to them this way . that in turn led to some complications : islamic clerics around the world expressed anger at the extremist group being used to portray all of islam , and requested that it be called by another name ( a group of british imams suggested calling it the “ un - islamic state ,” arguing that it was “ neither islamic , nor is it a state ”). <PARA> that issue ties in with why it ’ s exceedingly unlikely that real isis militants are recruiting children in the heartland of brownsburg , indiana ( or anywhere else ), to join their organization and referring to themselves by their “ new preferred name of daesh ”: because the real isis group reportedly detests that name . <PARA> isis has been referred to in other parts of the world as elsewhere as daesh ( or da ’ ish , daesh , daiish , daash , daiish , and daish ), an acronym formed from the transliterated arabic phrase al - dawla al - islamiya fi al - iraq wa al - sham ( which has roughly the same meaning as isis ). as the washington post reported , however , isis itself considers that name to be derogatory : <PARA> in most arabic nations the group is generally referred to as daesh . some non - arab countries , including france , have begun using the name , too . “ i do not recommend using the term islamic state because it blurs the lines between islam , muslims and islamists ,” foreign minister laurent fabius told reporters . “ the arabs call it ‘ daesh ’ and i will be calling them the ‘ daesh cutthroats .'” <PARA> swapping one acronym for another may not seem like too big a deal . but there ’ s an interesting detail here : according to multiple reports , the islamic state loathes the name . there have been reports of the islamic state threatening to cut out the tongues of anyone who used the phrase publicly , perhaps due to the word ’ s similarity to another arabic word , das , which means to trample down or crush . the word “ daeshi ” is used as an insult by anti - islamic state groups . <PARA> swapping one acronym for another may not seem like too big a deal . but there ’ s an interesting detail here : according to multiple reports , the islamic state loathes the name . there have been reports of the islamic state threatening to cut out the tongues of anyone who used the phrase publicly , perhaps due to the word ’ s similarity to another arabic word , das , which means to trample down or crush . the word “ daeshi ” is used as an insult by anti - islamic state groups . <PARA> is isis really recruiting pre - teens in indiana to join a “ fun group ” called “ daesh ”? almost certainly not ( especially given that , as referenced above , local police have heard nothing about any such activity ). perhaps some pranksters are going around town telling kids they ’ re from isis as a lark , but we likely need not fear that 11 - year - old hoosiers are being cajoled into taking up arms to fight on the side of islamic militants .	
mixture	the new maine governor , paul lepage is making new jersey ’ s chris christie <PARA> look like an enabler . he isn ’ t afraid to say what he thinks . judging by <PARA> the comments , every time he opens his mouth , his popularity goes up . <PARA> he brought down the house at his inauguration when he shook his fist <PARA> toward the media box and said , “ you ’ re on notice ! i ’ ve inherited a <PARA> financially troubled state to run . observe ... cover what we do ... but don ’ t <PARA> whine if i don ’ t waste time responding to your every whim just for your <PARA> amusement .” <PARA> during his campaign for governor , he was talking to commercial fishermen <PARA> who are struggling because of federal fisheries rules . they complained <PARA> that 0bama brought his family to bar harbor and acadia national park for a <PARA> long labor day holiday and found time to meet with union leaders , but <PARA> wouldn ’ t talk to the fishermen . lepage replied , “ i ’ d tell him to go to <PARA> hell and get out of my state .” the lame stream media crucified lepage , but <PARA> he jumped 6 points in the pre - election poll . <PARA> the martin luther king incident was a political sandbag , which brought him <PARA> national exposure . the ‘ lame stream ’ media crucified him , but word on the <PARA> street is very positive . the naacp specifically asked lepage to spend mlk <PARA> day visiting black inmates at the maine state prison . he told them that he <PARA> would meet with all inmates , regardless of race , if he were to visit the <PARA> prison . the naacp balked and then put out a news release claiming falsely <PARA> that he refused to participate in any mlk events . he read it in the paper <PARA> for the 1st time the next morning while being driven to an event and went <PARA> ballistic because none of the reporters had called him for comment before <PARA> running the naacp release . <PARA> he arrived at that event & said in front of a tv camera , “ if they want to <PARA> play the race card on me they can kiss my ass ”, and he reminded them that <PARA> he has an adopted black son from jamaica and that he attended the local <PARA> mlk breakfast every year that he was mayor of waterville .

( each time the state closes for snow , it costs <PARA> the taxpayers about $ 1 million in wages for no work in return .) <PARA> lepage was ceo of the marden ’ s chain of discount family bargain retail <PARA> stores before election as governor . he noted that state employees getting <PARA> off work early could still find lots of retail stores open to shop . so , he <PARA> put the state employees on notice by announcing : “ if marden ’ s is open , <PARA> maine is open !” <PARA> he told state employees : “ we live in maine in the winter , for heaven ’ s <PARA> sake , and should know how to drive in it . otherwise , apply for a state job <PARA> in florida !” <PARA> governor lepage symbolizes what america needs ; refreshing politicians who <PARA> aren ’ t self - serving and who exhibit common sense . <PARA> origins : paul lepage is the republican governor of maine who was elected to that office in 2010 after serving eight years as the mayor of waterville . prior to his stint as waterville ’ s mayor , lepage was general manager of marden ’ s surplus and salvage , a discount chain with 14 stores throughout the state of maine . shortly after lepage took office as governor in january 2011 the laudatory piece about him reproduced above began circulating on the internet ; we found its salient points to be a mixture of varying degrees of truthfulness as described below : <PARA> although this inaugural statement attributed to governor lepage is widely quoted on internet sites , it doesn ’ t appear in either the transcript or the video recording of his inaugural address . perhaps he said it some other point during his inaugural day ceremonies , but we haven ’ t yet been able to find a source documenting that he did . <PARA> while on the campaign trail in september 2010 , lepage did make a comment to a group of fishermen about how he would “ tell obama to go to hell ,” although an associated press account of the incident gives it a somewhat different context : <PARA> republican gubernatorial candidate paul lepage told a group of fishermen at a gop forum that he won ’ t be afraid to tell president barack obama to “ go to hell .” <PARA> lepage [ said ] that he regretted the words he chose in the small coastal town of brooksville but that he wasn ’ t backing down in his criticism of the administration for what he describes as free - spending , antibusiness policies . <PARA> lepage was responding to a question when he made the remark about obama , which was captured by a democratic party aide who was videotaping the event . <PARA> “ as your governor , you ’ re going to be seeing a lot of me on the front page , saying ‘ governor lepage tells obama to go to hell ,'” lepage said to applause . <PARA> lepage ’ s remark was part of a longer discussion of issues at the fishermen ’ s forum . dennis blodgett , the town ’ s gop committee chairman , said much of the discussion focused on “ too many federal regulations being crammed down our throats .” <PARA> lepage [ said ] that he regretted the words he chose in the small coastal town of brooksville but that he wasn ’ t backing down in his criticism of the administration for what he describes as free - spending , antibusiness policies . <PARA> lepage was responding to a question when he made the remark about obama , which was captured by a democratic party aide who was videotaping the event . <PARA> “ as your governor , you ’ re going to be seeing a lot of me on the front page , saying ‘ governor lepage tells obama to go to hell ,'” lepage said to applause . <PARA> lepage ’ s remark was part of a longer discussion of issues at the fishermen ’ s forum . dennis blodgett , the town ’ s gop committee chairman , said much of the discussion focused on “ too many federal regulations being crammed down our throats .” <PARA> in january 2011 , some news accounts reported that governor lepage had declined an naacp invitation to attend an naacp - sponsored martin luther king day event which included a meeting with black inmates at the maine state prison , with the governor stating that he would meet with all prisoners or none at all , and telling the organization to “ kiss my butt ” when they responded that his proposal was unacceptable : <PARA> maine governor paul lepage declined an naacp invitation to attend martin luther king day events . he ’ ll be attending a funeral of a state trooper . <PARA> naacp didn ’ t like that , and questioned his support for them . lepage responded ... uhm ... pretty clearly . <PARA> “ they are a special interest . end of story ... and i ’ m not going to be held hostage by special interests . and if they want , they can look at my family picture . my son happens to be black , so they can do whatever they ’ d like about it . the fact of the matter is there ’ s only so many hours in a day , so many hours in a week , and so much that you can do .” <PARA> he ’ s turned down naacp invitations before . <PARA> “ they invited me to go to the state prison to meet black prisoners . i told them i would go , i ’ d be more than happy to go , but i would meet all prisoners , and that wasn ’ t acceptable to them . so tough luck .” <PARA> to the suggestion that he had a pattern of slighting the n . a . a . c . p ., he replied , <PARA> “ tell them to kiss my butt ,” adding , “ if they want to play the race card , come to dinner ;

unproven	having reviewed the many rejection letters i have received in the last few weeks , it is with great regret that i must inform you i am unable to accept your rejection at this time . <PARA> this year , after applying to a great many colleges and universities , i received an especially fine crop of rejection letters . unfortunately , the number of rejections that i can accept is limited . <PARA> each of my rejections was reviewed carefully and on an individual basis . many factors were taken into account – the size of the institution , student - faculty ratio , location , reputation , costs and social atmosphere . <PARA> i am certain that most colleges i applied to are more than qualified to reject me . i am also sure that some mistakes were made in turning away some of these rejections . i can only hope they were few in number . <PARA> i am aware of the keen disappointment my decision may bring . throughout my deliberations , i have kept in mind the time and effort it may have taken for you to reach your decision to reject me . <PARA> keep in mind that at times it was necessary for me to reject even those letters of rejection that would normally have met my traditionally high standards . <PARA> i appreciate your having enough interest in me to reject my application . let me take the opportunity to wish you well in what i am sure will be a successful academic year . <PARA> see you in the fall ! <PARA> sincerely , <PARA> paul devlin <PARA> applicant at large <PARA> origins : a pair of television commercials for cingular ’ s “ go phone ” service ( viewable here and here ) employ an interesting gimmick . although the scenario depicted in both commercials is very familiar to viewers — a parent and a child <PARA> engaging in an argument over something the child wants but the parent is declining to provide — the dialogue between the characters subverts that familiarity by stating just the opposite : the parent is in fact trying to provide something desired by the child , but the latter is declining to accept it . we ’ re so used to the speech cadences and body language of the original scenarios , however , that it ’ s easy to miss what the characters are actually saying in these commercials by assuming that it fits the expected pattern . <PARA> the same sort of technique is employed in the example of correspondence reproduced above . superficially , it looks like a standard rejection letter ; upon closer examination , however , one discerns that it is a response from a spurned applicant who is using the same language and format as the original notice to “ decline ” his rejection ( i . e ., “ i am unable to accept your rejection at this time .”). <PARA> this particular form of the “ anti - rejection letter ” dates back at least as far as 1981 , when , as paul devlin later explained , he was inspired to send it to harvard after noticing that their rejection letter to him had contained a grammatical error : <PARA> when i was a senior in high school , i noticed that the rejection letter i received from harvard had a grammatical error . so , i wrote a letter back , rejecting their rejection letter . then i sent a version to all the colleges that had rejected me . <PARA> my mother , nancy devlin , sent a copy of this letter to the new york times and it was published in the new jersey section in 1981 . then in the mid -’ 90s or so , there was a cover story in the new york times magazine about the trauma students were experiencing getting rejected from colleges . as an education writer , my mom knows all too well that educational issues are cyclical . so she re - submitted the letter . <PARA> this time it was published in the op - ed section of the sunday new york times , a very prestigious , high - profile space . it turns out the letter had already become popular and was reprinted in newspapers , books etc .

false	fisher price is offering a refund for these dolls , but has no intention of taking them all of the shelves . i will no longer buy any fisher price toys , which is very unfortunate because they have great toys . <PARA> i will visit every wal - mart in the texas panhandle to make sure that these dolls are taken off of the shelves . <PARA> this is absolutely unacceptable ! <PARA> if you ’ re near a wal - mart , target or toys r us , demand that they take these dolls off of the shelves ! if a doll said , “ jesus loves me ” without stating so on the packaging , they would be off the shelves in a second . <PARA> here ’ s a link to the doll : <PARA> <URL> <PARA> origins : in october 2008 some parents of children who owned “ little mommy real loving baby cuddle ‘ n coo ” dolls reported odd utterances made by those talking toys . they heard statements such as “ islam is the light ” <PARA> and “ satan is king ” emanate from them , vocalizations regarded as sneaky attempts at indoctrination of impressionable children into belief systems not favored by their families . <PARA> what they heard wasn ’ t what the dolls were saying . <PARA> “ little mommy real loving baby cuddle ‘ n coo ” was one of a line of “ little mommy real loving baby ” dolls manufactured by fisher - price , a subsidiary of toy giant mattel , inc . the doll ’ s verbalizations set it apart from other offerings in that toy line : “ cuddle ‘ n coo ” was advertised as producing cooing , giggling , and babbling sounds rather than words , thereby imitating the pre - language vocalizations made by babies . according to the manufacturer , the only actual word the doll said was “ mama ”; all else was but imagination , the simulated nonsensical babblings of infants mistaken for english - language words . contrary to what up - in - arms parents were hearing , the dolls were not saying anything about islam or satan ; they were merely making the sorts of noises a cooing infant would make . <PARA> mattel said in a press statement about the controversial doll that : <PARA> the little mommy cuddle ‘ n coo dolls feature realistic baby sounds including cooing , giggling , and baby babble with no real sentence structure . the only scripted word the doll says is “ mama .” there is a sound that may resemble something close to the word “ night , right , or light .” <PARA> because the original sound track is compressed into a file that can be played through an inexpensive toy speaker , actual sounds may be imprecise or distorted . <PARA> because the original sound track is compressed into a file that can be played through an inexpensive toy speaker , actual sounds may be imprecise or distorted . <PARA> the gastonia gazette found that when they had four people unfamiliar with the little mommy cuddle ‘ n coo controversy listen to the sounds the doll produces , none of them identified anything sounding like english in the babbling save for the word “ light ” or “ life ”: <PARA> the gazette bought one of the disputed dolls for $ 19 . 99 at the gastonia target . four people were selected at random and asked to describe the noises it made , and while two distinctly heard the word “ light ” or “ life ,” no one picked out the supposed muslim message . <PARA> other toys that speak have been the focus of similar misunderstandings . the 2006 talking book potty time with elmo had some folks hearing its “ uh - oh ! who has to go ?” phrase as “ uh - oh ! who wants to die ?” — a negative toilet - training message if there ever was one . <PARA> in 1982 similar problems plagued “ baby darling ,” a doll manufactured in hong kong . american consumers mistook its spanish “ quiero a mami ” ( meaning “ i want mommy ” or “ i love mommy ”) as “ kill <PARA> mommy .” <PARA> as to why we misperceive sounds that are nonsensical or words uttered in foreign languages , we humans are pattern - seeking critters . because we ’ re not geared to handle blasts of random input on the basis of what they are , we instinctively shoehorn the chaos we encounter into forms that are familiar to us . that leads us to see rabbits and sailing ships in clouds and hear supernatural whisperings in the sounds made by waterfalls and strong winds . it also leads to our picking up disquieting or even frightening messages from audio files embedded into children ’ s toys and played through tinny speakers . haphazard babblings are “ heard ” as strings of actual words , and sentences spoken in other tongues are “ heard ” as phonetic approximations in our own . <PARA> we “ hear ” what we expect to hear , which is words spoken in our mother language honed into meaningful sentences . such instinctive behavior leads to perfectly innocuous talking dolls being regarded as imparting satanic messages , especially when we ’ ve already been exposed to suggestive rumors telling us what we ’ re supposed to be hearing . <PARA> however , that there isn ’ t anything actually amiss with the “ little mommy real loving baby cuddle and coo ” doll doesn ’ t mean it ’ s going to win over the public . the bottom line regarding such misunderstood toys is that it doesn ’ t really matter what they are actually saying or why we mishear their verbalizations as something completely different than what ’ s been programmed into them ; it ’ s what we perceive them to be saying . few parents will happily keep a doll in the house that it hears as voicing “ kill mommy ” or “ satan is king .” <PARA> barbara “ baby talk ” mikkelson	
false	examples : <PARA> there is a request going around in our area asking for plastic bottle caps of any kind — water bottles , soda , laundry detergent , etc . supposedly , if you save 1 , 500 of these caps , someone is entitled to a free chemo treatment . <PARA> [ collected via e - mail , september 2008 ] <PARA> i have heard about collecting bottle caps for cancer patients . apparently , for every 1 , 000 caps collected , a patient can receive a chemotherapy treatment . <PARA> [ collected via e - mail , october 2008 ] <PARA> i have been asked to collect used bottle caps from plastic bottles ( pepsi and coke ). i was told that these caps are given to chemo patients who are uninsured for chemo treatment . they are supposed to receive one minute of free chemo for one bottle cap . <PARA> [ collected via e - mail , april 2015 ] <PARA> hi , i saw that you have an article on collecting plastic bottle <PARA> caps to redeem for wheelchairs , chemo , etc . you list this as a false <PARA> story . <PARA> apparently this woman has gotten a contract with recyclers in various <PARA> places to buy these caps and the money goes to those needing wheelchairs , <PARA> etc . <PARA> maybe this was once a false story but has now become true ? <PARA> origins : it is difficult to turn one ’ s back on an appeal for help , especially one made on behalf of a gravely ill child . people want to help ; their hearts do go out to others , no matter what their own circumstances might be . <PARA> that one simple inescapable fact worked to fuel a “ something for nothing ” hoax in and around west virginia through the summer and fall of 2008 . <PARA> somehow people came to believe that a child in need of chemotherapy could be benefited through the collection of plastic caps from milk jugs , soda bottles , and water bottles ; that for every so many of those items collected , that ailing tot would be given a chemo session free of charge . no one knew the identity of the child ( although some who repeated the rumor specified he was a 5 - year - old boy ), and the details about how many caps would earn a free session ( some said 1 , 000 , some said 1 , 500 , some said one minute for each plastic top ) shifted from telling to telling . as to who would be providing those cost - free cancer treatments , that too was up in the air : over time , various hospitals were named as the putative parties that would trade chemo for caps , as was the american cancer society . the method by which such a swap was to occur ( e . g ., boxloads of caps handed over in exchange for chemo sessions ; recycling of the caps for cash , then using of the money so garnered to pay for the treatments ) also varied depending on the person passing along the rumor . <PARA> the collection effort was all in the name of aiding a sick kid . never mind that no one knew the child ’ s name or where he lived , or what to do with the caps , or who was behind the supposed “ caps for chemo ” program — somewhere an unnamed youngster was languishing for lack of the medical help the plastic tops of bottles could bring . your plastic bottles . it was heady stuff . <PARA> heady enough to keep people from looking too hard at the hoax in front of them and risking their seeing it for what it was . <PARA> plastic bottle caps have no inherent monetary value . unlike aluminum cans ( and the metal tabs attached to them ), they aren ’ t worth anything as raw material because such caps are the wrong form of plastic to be recycled . there is therefore virtually no market for used plastic bottle <PARA> tops . but even though the collected bottle caps weren ’ t worth anything in and of themselves , and no large corporation was trumpeting its involvement in the rumored “ save a kid by saving your bottle caps ” program , people ’ s desire to help blinded them to those realities . <PARA> little worked to stop the spread of the hoax once it was underway . while it ’ s hard to pinpoint precisely when and where the “ save a cancer - stricken child by saving your bottle caps ” belief first surfaced , the manager of one concern in beckley , west virginia , says her store began collecting lids in june 2008 after her minister announced he had heard by phone of a lad who would receive one chemotherapy treatment for 1 , 500 lids . parishioners were entreated to save their caps to aid this child , and to pass on this request to their co - workers and other contacts . said lids were to be taken to raleigh general hospital , a medical facility in that city . ( according to the hospital ’ s marketing director , kevin mcgraw , that facility is not and never has been involved in such a program . one of its employees , however , was collecting the caps by the vanload in the belief these otherwise discardables would help cancer patients , which is perhaps where the link between the caps collection and raleigh general began .) <PARA> other churches in the area were similarly involved in the harvesting of bottle caps for the unnamed child . they too asked their churchgoers to save these bottle caps and to ask their friends , neighbors , and employers to do so . from there the rumor spread : in august 2008 , associated press reported that “ churches , restaurants and businesses from wheeling to bluefield have been collecting plastic bottle caps , fueled by fliers that claim the caps can be redeemed for money to pay for cancer treatment .” <PARA> many people were taken in by the hoax . girl scouts troop 650 of ellerslie , maryland , collected plastic bottle caps and turned them in to ruby memorial hospital in morgantown , west virginia , believing their efforts would give a cancer patient one free chemotherapy treatment . collection bins at area stores and businesses in beckley , west virginia , were stocked with thousands of bottle caps by folks who thought they were helping some poor unfortunate child gain the chemo treatments he or she so desperately needed . <PARA> yet there never was such a child or such a program on his or her behalf . all efforts to locate the ailing tot failed , as did those to work out who to turn the caps over to or how to turn them into chemo treatments for anyone . <PARA> the american cancer society has this to say about the hoax : <PARA> after extensive research , the american cancer society has concluded that the plastic bottle caps for chemo program is a hoax . the origin of the hoax remains unclear , but it is similar to other “ cash for trash ” hoaxes that have circulated worldwide for years . <PARA> thousands upon thousands of lovingly - collected caps were unceremoniously dumped in the trash once the hoax was revealed . collection bins were taken down , and new donations of caps were turned away . <PARA> it is true that occasionally a large company will “ redeem ” up to a certain number of lids or labels from its products for a cash amount to be directed to a particular charity or cause ( e . g ., yoplait ‘ s annual commitment to donate 10 ¢ per lid from its products to breast cancer research via its “ friends in the fight ” program , up to a maximum donation of $ 1 . 6 million ). however , such beneficences are specific product promotions meant to encourage purchase of the items bearing those labels or lids and to position the host company favorably in the shopper ’ s mind as a warm , caring corporation committed to aiding mankind . such promotions don ’ t encompass every lid or label from all manner of consumer goods ( including those of competitors ), and the name of the business entity sponsoring the largesse is prominently featured in everything having to do with the promotion . <PARA> in august 2010 another version of the bottle cap hoax appeared at bagram airfield , a u . s . air force base in afghanistan . motivated by a rumor that came from no one knew where , personnel at that base began collecting caps from empty water bottles in the belief that those items would be recycled into prosthetic limbs for disabled servicemembers . bins to collect these caps sprang up around the base , and thousands ( likely hundreds of thousands ) of caps were tossed into them . <PARA> missing in all of this charitable activity was any notion of who was responsible for assembling the large collection of caps and transporting it , or where the shipment was to be sent for processing into artificial limbs . the local judge advocate general ( jag ) office investigated the rumor and attempted to pin down the main point of contact ( poc ) for the cap drive , but while drop - off locations for the plastic tops were easily found , the trails dead - ended at them . lt . col . thomas rodrigues , the jag officer running the investigation , said : “ not surprisingly , with every interview at each collection site , no one had an overall poc , knew who the actual beneficiary was , or what to do with the collected caps .” <PARA> contact with hanger prosthetics and orthotics , inc ., the largest prosthetic limb manufacturer , confirmed that the rumor had indeed been a snipe hunt . the prosthetic company ’ s public relations representative said that military members in need of artificial limbs receive new , top - of - the - line prosthetics , and recycled bottle caps would never be used in such products . <PARA> barbara “ recap ” mikkelson

partum period ). <PARA> it ’ s true lawsuits have been over hair loss supposedly caused by wen brand hair care products , but no substantive evidence has yet been produced demonstrating that the wen line of hair products is any more damaging than other similar products . moreover , the manner in which wen hair care products purportedly caused the damage in question has not been explained . <PARA> update : in november 2015 , a group of 200 women across the us joined a class - action lawsuit against wen , claiming it caused severe , perhaps irreversible damage to their hair .	
unproven	during a local wedding , one of the bridesmaids got the spike heel of her shoe caught in a ventilation grate in the aisle . the next usher coming down the aisle tried to pick up the shoe ; the entire grate came up , so he just took it with him . <PARA> then the bride came down the aisle and fell in the hole . <PARA> origins : this legend about a <PARA> mortifying wedding mishap in which a bridesmaid ’ s spiked heel pulls off a grate cover set into the floor and sends the bride tumbling into the void has been kicking around for over half a century now . it ’ s also a prime example of how real - life events can be transmuted through changes of detail and setting into much more memorable legendary forms that spread far and wide . <PARA> this legend was originally popularized through an anecdote published in the january 1958 edition of the venerable reader ’ s digest : <PARA> it started at the end of a sunday morning service in an ontario church . the choir began the recessional , singing as they marched in perfect unison up the center aisle to the back of the church . the last young lady in the women ’ s section was wearing a new pair of shoes with needle heels — heels that are so slender they slip through any grating . and in the aisle was a grating that covered the hot - air register . <PARA> without a thought for her fancy heels , the young woman sang and marched . and the heel of one shoe sank right through a hole in the register grate . instantly she realized her predicament . she knew she couldn ’ t hold up the whole recessional while she back - stepped to pull out her heel . she did the next best thing in the emergency . without missing a step , she slipped her foot out of her shoe and continued up the aisle . there wasn ’ t a break in the recessional . everything moved like clockwork . <PARA> the first man following that young woman noted the situation and , without losing a beat , reached down and picked up her shoe . <PARA> the entire grate came along with it . startled but still singing , the man continued up the aisle bearing in his hand one grate attached to one shoe . <PARA> never a break in the recessional . everybody singing . everything moving like clockwork . and then in tune and in time to the beat the next man stepped into the open register . <PARA> without a thought for her fancy heels , the young woman sang and marched . and the heel of one shoe sank right through a hole in the register grate . instantly she realized her predicament . she knew she couldn ’ t hold up the whole recessional while she back - stepped to pull out her heel . she did the next best thing in the emergency . without missing a step , she slipped her foot out of her shoe and continued up the aisle . there wasn ’ t a break in the recessional . everything moved like clockwork . <PARA> the first man following that young woman noted the situation and , without losing a beat , reached down and picked up her shoe . <PARA> the entire grate came along with it . startled but still singing , the man continued up the aisle bearing in his hand one grate attached to one shoe . <PARA> never a break in the recessional . everybody singing . everything moving like clockwork . and then in tune and in time to the beat the next man stepped into the open register . <PARA> as tracked by folklorist jan harold brunvand , the 1958 reader ’ s digest version quoted above was attributed to the canadian newspaper the kitchener - waterloo record , which in turn quoted another publication called the lutheran . where it presumably originated as a report on a real occurrence . it turned out that these account were all based on something that did indeed transpire in real life , but it didn ’ t occur in canada , or in a lutheran church , or during a wedding . the underlying event had taken place more than a decade earlier at the hanover presbyterian church in hanover , indiana , at the end of a regular church service : <PARA> several readers in dayton , ohio , said that they knew of the story from their local paper , the dayton journal - herald , which had mentioned specific names . i also got a letter from woodfin (“ woody ”) jones , <PARA> who was a witness to the incident and had been the source of the first printed version [ published on 15 august 1957 ]. <PARA> according to woody jones , he and two beta theta pi fraternity brothers , jim stuckey and ed steiner , were involved in the event , which took place in spring 1949 . <PARA> according to jones , stuckey was the one who picked up the woman ’ s shoe along with the grate ; another student behind him stepped over the hole ; and ed steiner , a baritone , fell into it . <PARA> i also checked with woody ’ s former college classmates . james a . stuckey backed his two fraternity brothers with this elegant testimonial he sent me : “ i , james albert stuckey , was a member of the hanover college choir in the spring of 1949 who , during the recessional , spied the shoe caught in the grate of the hot air register in the center of the aisle . being the kind of courteous , thoughtful freshman so highly prized in those days , i stopped to retrieve the shoe ... and the grate ... tucked both under my copy of the hymnal and continued down the aisle .'” <PARA> edwin c . steiner , hanover class of 1950 , also confirmed the story : “ yes , it was certainly i who fell into that hot air duct . i hit the hole cleanly ;

false	despite the claims made in online versions , a question supposedly revealing of psychopaths was not authored by a “ famous american psychologist ,” nor does it come from “ a genuine psychological test ”: <PARA> do not believe everything everything that turns up in on the internet , especially items so sorely vague about their bona fides . <PARA> let ’ s talk about why this isn ’ t real . as the tire nut legend so eloquently illustrates , just because someone is crazy doesn ’ t mean he ’ s also stupid . psychopaths ( also known as sociopaths ) possess the same problem - solving skills that the rest of us do , and some of them have been found to be remarkably brilliant ( ted bundy , for example ). the assumption that all sociopaths approach problems with a “ whom can i kill to solve this ?” mentality ( and that sociopaths believe everyone else thinks this way as well ) is an erroneous assumption based upon a false stereotype . most sociopaths would find this question as illogical as the rest of us and ponder a whole range of other possibilities ( e . g ., why didn ’ t the girl strike up a conversation with the man at the funeral , examine the condolence book afterwards , or ask her sister about him ?), and rather than just blurting out the purported “ typical ” response , many of them would provide answers just as mainstream as those offered by us “ normal ” folks ( e . g ., one sister thought the other was involved with the mystery man and killed her sibling over an imagined romantic rivalry ). <PARA> in other words , this isn ’ t a question where all the psychopaths would go one way and everybody else would go another . as a quick and easy way to separate the sheep from the murderous goats , it wouldn ’ t work . besides , no one hypothetical is ever going to reveal the state of any person ’ s mental condition : whole batteries of multi - item tests are needed for that . entirely healthy folks can answer one isolated question in such a way as to indicate the possible presence of mental illness , just as the severely ill can answer the same question in a healthy manner . <PARA> the appeal of this one - question pop psych quiz lies in its implicit promise that by using it , you can locate the psychopaths lurking in your circle of acquaintance and thereby protect yourself from them , or perhaps in the process of your answering it you ’ ll uncover some deep , dark secret you ’ ve been keeping from yourself . we like our world simplified whenever possible , and therefore anything that appears to be an easy - to - use tool will be quickly seized upon , even if it ’ s flawed . <PARA> would that it were that simple . psychopaths are intermingled with the general population and are not that easily identified . they are best characterized as persons devoid of remorse and empathy . what sets them apart is not that these two characteristics are depressed or reduced in them , but that they are entirely missing . psychopaths are held in check only by their fear of being caught and punished ; the potential impact of their actions upon others is without relevance to them , and guilt is just a word in the dictionary to them , not something they themselves experience . <PARA> not all psychopaths are rampaging killers , constantly on the hunt for their next victims . many live law - abiding lives and outwardly appear quite normal . they lack a sense of right versus wrong , and they do not care about the people in their lives , not even their spouses or children ; the risk to their own well - being is what keeps them , for the most part , on the straight and narrow . these are not healthy individuals to become involved with , but on the other hand , they are not necessarily mere heartbeats away from taking up the nearest hatchet and laying waste to the steno pool just because it ’ s tuesday . <PARA> a psychopath might think to murder her sister after their mother ’ s death , but the motivation would more likely be one of inheritance . “ why settle for half an estate when only one person stands between me and all of it ?” would be a more prevalent line of thought .	
unproven	the photograph displayed above , purportedly showing “ the eyes that saw a nuke ,” is frequently shared on social media sites . although the image is a real photograph , the title commonly applied to it may be misleading . <PARA> the photograph was taken by scandinavian photographer christer strömholm in hiroshima in 1963 , about 18 years after a nuclear bomb was detonated over the japanese city . while it is not possible to verify the age of the woman shown in the photo , it appears that she is too young to have witnessed the nuclear blast first hand : <PARA> furthermore , when the auction house bukowskis collected images from strömholm ’ s hiroshima suite , that collection included several photographs of children . while legendary photo notes that strömholm traveled to japan in the 1960s to take photos of the victims of hiroshima , it appears that the photographer also snapped several shots of the children of survivors : <PARA> while we cannot definitively say that this image depicts “ eyes that saw a nuke ,” it is clear that christer strömholm ’ s photograph at least captured a woman living in hiroshima in the aftermath of a nuclear detonation .	
unproven	origins : on 14 march 2015 , facebook user sami kae posted a video which purportedly showed pieces of glass found inside a container of dippin ’ stix brand fruit and vegetable slices and dip snacks . <PARA> while the video ( which has since been removed ) only showed one individual package of dippin ’ stix , kae claimed that she found glass in several recently purchased packages . she also maintained that she discovered dead ants inside the dippin ’ stix containers . <PARA> on 17 march 2015 , dippin ’ stix issued a response to kae ’ s post . while the company promised its customers that it was taking the claim seriously , they also expressed some skepticism about it for a few reasons : they said there is no glass in their manufacturing facilities , that the small specks shown in the video were likely part of an apple seed and not a bunch of dead ants , that this is the first time they had ever received such a complaint , and that the packages in question had been discarded by the consumer and thus were unavailable for examination : <PARA> we ’ ve been made aware of a video concerning our product that was posted this weekend . we are taking this product safety concern very seriously ! food safety has always been a number one priority for reichel foods ; we eat our products too ! the possibility of glass shards finding their way in to our products is very puzzling because we do not have any glass in our manufacturing facility . likewise , we have never experienced any similar situation or product complaints of this nature . we have not found any ants in our facility ( it is winter here ) and we believe the specks seen on the apples were likely part of an apple seed , apple skin , etc . if we could have gotten the product back , we would be able to examine it more closely . the lot code information from the package is critical for a thorough investigation and unfortunately , the object and all product purchased was thrown away . without this information and the object , it is very difficult for us to pinpoint a source . hopefully the consumer that posted this video will cooperate with us in providing as much information as possible so we can complete our investigation . <PARA> while the authenticity of this video is still being investigated , it appears that this is an isolated incident . dippin ’ stix has not issued a recall and sami kae is apparently the only person who has claimed to have found glass and dead ants in one of the company ’ s products .	
true	as folklorist jan harold brunvand wrote back in 1988 , rumors of mice found in soda bottles and cans have a long history in urban folklore . and as explained in one of our own articles , the supposed remarkable dissolving power of modern sodas is another familiar aspect of urban folklore . both of those elements came into play in january 2012 , when public attention was directed to a february 2011 article from the madison / st . clair record which referenced a lawsuit filed against pepsico by a man named ronald ball , alleging that after he purchased a can of mountain dew soda from a vending machine at work , he found a dead mouse inside of it . <PARA> readers of that article focused on a pair of sentences near the end of the story : <PARA> ronald ball did indeed have a pending lawsuit against pepsico , as the record reported back in may 2009 : <PARA> in response to ball ’ s claims , pepsico filed with the court an 8 april 2010 affidavit from lawrence mcgill , a licensed veterinarian with a speciality in veterinary pathology . in his affidavit , dr . mcgill stated that after a mouse had been submerged in a fluid such as mountain dew for 30 days or more , the mouse would “ have been transformed into a ‘ jelly - like ’ substance ”: <PARA> likewise , dr . yan - fang ren of the university of rochester school of medicine and dentistry averred that a soft drink such as mountain dew could dissolve a mouse that was immersed in it , leaving behind only some soft tissue : <PARA> however , after examining the rodent provided by the plaintiff to pepsico , dr . mcgill also ventured his opinion that it could not possibly have been found in the can of mountain dew as claimed , because it wasn ’ t even born until several weeks after the can had been filled and sealed :

( his first prominent role , after all , was the recurring character of a minister on the wholesome television drama the waltons .) nonetheless , one of mr . ritter ’ s performances briefly became something of a cause celebre in march 2001 , when a viewer supposedly alerted nickelodeon ( a cable station which was re - running old episodes of three ’ s company ) that jack tripper ’ s testicles could be glimpsed in a 17 - year - old episode of the sitcom ! <PARA> according to a report by msnbc gossip columnist jeanette walls , a sharp - eyed viewer phoned nickelodeon to call the briefly risqué scene to their attention : <PARA> jack was dressed in blue boxers and plopped down on the bed [ and ] exposed some things that probably shouldn ’ t be seen on television . <PARA> they were shocked and said , ‘ gosh , you were right .’ they were taken off - guard because this has probably aired hundreds of times since the ’ 80s . <PARA> they were shocked and said , ‘ gosh , you were right .’ they were taken off - guard because this has probably aired hundreds of times since the ’ 80s . <PARA> although nickelodeon would not identify the specific episode involved , other accounts pegged the scene as part of a final - season episode , “ the charming stranger ,” originally broadcast on 20 december 1983 . ( unbeknownst to jack and his roommates , a ventriloquist moves into an adjacent apartment . the trio overhears him rehearsing his act and , unaware of the context , believes him to be a jewel thief and a murderer . hijinks ensue .) a representative for <PARA> nickelodeon was quoted as confirming “ yes , his scrotum falls out of his shorts ,” and marveled that the episode had been run so many times without anyone ’ s noticing the blooper . nickelodeon also said it would snip the offending bit from future repeats . <PARA> still , this isn ’ t something we ’ d document as true until we ’ d seen it for ourselves . ( what one viewer thinks is a brief glimpse of testicles might look like something else to another viewer , and you can never be too sure what an entertainment company might be promulgating as a publicity stunt .) unfortunately , if the episode truly has been edited , watching it now won ’ t yield a definitive answer ; we ’ d have to obtain a tape of a pre - 2001 airing . ( a purportedly unedited version of the clip in question is embedded above .) <PARA> for what it ’ s worth , john ritter explained why this bit went unnoticed for so long during an appearance on conan o ’ brien ’ s late night talk show : <PARA> it was a brief shot , and only lasted a second . no one back then noticed it , and when it went out over the air , there were no vhs recorders or dvd players around that could catch it . then , very recently , some guy with a freeze frame caught the image when pausing the recording . so he called nick at nite . <PARA> the folks at fremantlemedia , who distributed three ’ s company ( among other programs ), confirmed for us that whatever there was to be seen of the normally - covered parts of jack tripper were scarcely noticeable under ordinary viewing conditions : <PARA> we have viewed the episode in question in search of the aforementioned ‘ fall - out ’, and are disappointed to say that having viewed the scene in question , there is very little to write home about . there is a nano - second where certain flesh is flashed , but not so much that you would really notice , unless you were looking out for it specifically . <PARA> for what it ’ s worth , screen captures of the scene in question taken from syndicated airings of the series at the time the rumor emerged showed little for viewers to be shocked about : <PARA> the most famous quip about this issue was uttered by john ritter , who told the new york observer when they asked him about the controversy : “ i ’ ve requested that [ nickelodeon ] air both versions , edited and unedited , because sometimes you feel like a nut , and sometimes you don ’ t .”	
false	the ever - increasing popularity of text messaging , e - mail , and social media ushered in some sweeping changes to patterns in human communication . among them was an upswing in use of abbreviations for common phrases , such as “ ty ” for “ thank you ,” “ btw ” for “ by the way , and “ lol ” for “ laughing out loud .” ( the latter term eventually evolved to serve as something of a linguistic filler , similar to terms like “ um ” or “ like ” and often used to denote receipt of communication .) <PARA> among internet slang abbreviations , lol is one of the most ( if not the most ) commonly used and oldest exemplars , officially added to the oxford english dictionary in 2011 . prior to that , rumors circulated involving less technologically savvy individuals ( generally a mother or grandmother ) taking the letters to mean “ lots of love ” and appending them to a text or e - mail notification of a death in the family . (“ your grandmother died . lol .”) <PARA> in november 2012 , a facebook page claimed that the abbreviation lol had a hidden occult meaning linked with satanism . according to rumor , the term was deliberately introduced to the vernacular for one of three commonly - cited reasons : to dupe the unwitting into pledging their allegiance to satan , as a cipher used by satanists to identify one another , or to end satanic prayers : <PARA> in actuality , lol isn ’ t all that new to the vernacular . researchers at oxford discovered its use ( in lieu of “ laughing out loud ”) dating to the 1980s : <PARA> by contrast , the claim lol abbreviated “ lucifer our lord ” appeared out of the ether in november 2012 . no mention of such a connotation predated the rumor ’ s first appearance , and documentation of the term ’ s generally accepted meaning of “ laughing out loud ” is extensive both on the internet and among linguists who have studied the usage of internet slang . had the “ lucifer ” variation legitimate been an ( even partial or marginal ) root , it would have shown up in the extensive research done on the etymology of lol prior to 2011 .	
false	in 1997 , a longtime sufferer of alopecia areata founded the now popular charity locks of love to provide children who suffer from hair loss due to medical conditions with high - quality wigs and hairpieces . and since at least 2005 , internet - based rumors have circulated claiming that the vast majority of hair donated to locks of love is resold to make commercially - vended wigs , that the charity provides very few free hairpieces relative to the volume of hair donated each year , and that most of those wigs aren ’ t made actually available to children with cancer . many critics have claimed that children lucky enough to receive wigs were charged exorbitant prices and made to endure a rigorous screening process : <PARA> before examining such rumors , we have to consider the scope of a charity like locks of love . hair donation charities have a primary function of raising money and providing hairpieces to people who suffer from chronic hair loss , but their secondary purpose is rather unique : while contributing to most other charities requires available cash , locks of love enables anyone who can grow healthy hair to contribute . because of the relatively low barrier to participation , locks of love and similar charitable entities remain popular among children and youth groups seeking to engage in good works . while hair donation is a particularly accessible form of charitable service , the ease of contributing has triggered skepticism and the fear that well - intentioned kids are being hooked and crooked for their good deeds . <PARA> in the march 2015 facebook post quoted above , the author claimed that locks of love only used a third of donated hair to craft wigs and sold the remaining two thirds to commercial hairpiece makers . locks of love themselves say that as much as 80 % of donated hair isn ’ t used to make hairpieces directly , but according to that organization and the wigmaker with whom they work , most donated hair cannot be used because it does not meet the necessary criteria for making hairpieces : <PARA> the interview quoted above ( which took place in 2007 ) made mention of the sale of hair to keep the charity running . however , such an admission is not necessarily suspect . as explained earlier , the charity functions in part to convert a resource nearly all can provide ( hair ) into a usable product for children in need . if that need is aided by selling some donated hair to fund manufacturing costs and the charity ’ s organizational needs , the charity ’ s primary goal ( acquiring and providing hairpieces to children ) is still being served . <PARA> locks of love ’ s web site addresses the matter of wig costs to recipients , noting that hairpieces are provided free to families who lack the means to purchase them . for others , the hairpieces are available on a sliding scale of prices depending upon their ability to pay : “ we provide hairpieces and repairs free of charge or on a sliding scale based on the financial need of those responsible for the children .” <PARA> also at issue is the matter of who the primary recipients of wigs are . one aspect of rumor states that children with cancer were not primary candidates for locks of love , another thing the charity itself has frequently explained : <PARA> while those looking to donate hair may prefer their donations help cancer sufferers , locks of love was founded by and operates primarily for sufferers of alopecia . this focus of the group does not constitute any subterfuge or lie by omission , as some rumors insinuated . the locks of love faq also addresses the sale of hair : <PARA> earlier rumors about locks of love claimed that the organization failed to account for a vast quantity of donated hair : <PARA> however , a number of factors were elided in that report . the value of donated hair when applied to actual hairpieces provided to children relied on a projection , not actual processing and manufacturing costs . also , locks of love must account for their incoming and outgoing expenses each year in tax filings . if the group truly trafficked heavily in black market hair , significant discrepancies would arise in their accounting books . despite the organization ’ s admitted lack of record - keeping in respect to hair received ( for which there is no clear monetary value ), any significant revenues from the sale of hair would have appeared on their ledgers as income . <PARA> the charity auditing page charity navigator rates locks of love favorably , with a total score of 92 . 7 points out of 100 . on the aspect of accountability locks of love scored 92 out of 100 , with more than 92 % of the charity ’ s expenses allocated to program costs . less than 7 % of expenses went to administrative costs and salaries , and ceo linda borum ’ s most recently listed salary ( for fiscal year 2015 ) was a modest $ 64 , 866 .	
false	in early 2015 , a photograph alleged to be that of a cute , odd - looking monkey from madagascar began circulating via social media . the image was frequently shared with the claim that the pictured creature was a “ madagascar southeast african monkey :” <PARA> this photograph , however , does not capture an unusual primate from madagascar . instead , it depicts a doll from the “ inari foxes ” collection produced by the santani workshop in russia . the group ’ s deviant art page features several related images , including the one displayed above , of mythical creatures made of “ different types of doll plastic like fimo , cernit , sculpey , sonet :”	
mixture	in early march 2015 , an article titled “ fake olive oil : what you need to know [ now ]” began circulating via social media , focusing on the health benefits of olive oil and making the claim that 69 % of store - bought olive oils are “ probably fake .” <PARA> predictably the claim was well - circulated among health buffs , as olive oil is prized for its status as a heart - healthy food . the prospect of counterfeit olive oil caused many diners to wonder what might be lurking in their bottles of bertolli and whether there was cause for concern over adulterants and impurities . <PARA> given the wording of that article , it was difficult to determine how a study might identify a specific proportion ( not “ about 70 %”, but precisely 69 %) of store - bought olive oil , yet only arrive at the partial conclusion that the referenced percentage of oils was “ probably fake ”: <PARA> embedded links in the article pointed back to the university of california davis olive center , which operates under the university ’ s college of agricultural and environmental sciences , so the article was referencing a document released by the center in april 2011 under the title “ report : evaluation of extra - virgin olive oil sold in california .” that paper was not a research study , but it did provide some context for the claim that 69 % of store - bought olive oil was “ fake .” <PARA> the olive center ’ s testing took place between 2008 and 2010 . researchers did not examine whether olive oil was “ fake ” as such ( i . e ., something other than olive oil misleadingly labeled as such ), but rather whether oils identified as “ extra virgin ” actually met the strict criteria required for that designation : <PARA> in the same passage , the center explained that the 69 % figure dated to 2010 tests of the sensory standards criteria for extra virgin olive oil and that the substandard olive oils were not unique to the united states : <PARA> while tests carried out on olive oil between 2008 and 2010 revealed that many store - vended oils did not meet the criteria set by regulatory agencies for the “ extra virgin ” label , the testing did not determine that the oils were “ fake ” in the sense of not being made from olives . the tested samples did not always meet the stringent extra - virgin standards for taste , aroma , and color , and the flavor profiles of some olive oils were likely overstated , but the samples were not oils produced from another source masquerading as olive oil , nor did the study raise concerns about purity , adulteration , safety , or substitution of various brands of olive oils .	
unproven	“ i had a miscarriage on palm sunday last year . we think he was a boy and named him david raphael . my only prayer when the doctor told me at 11 weeks that my baby had died a month earlier ( at 7 weeks gestation ), was that i would have something to bury . the doctor said he would either be too small to find or that his fragile body would be crushed in the miscarriage process and there wouldn ’ t be anything left . on palm sunday afternoon he came out . the entire sac was in tact and there he was still floating in the amniotic water . i took a picture so i wouldn ’ t forget that moment and how god answered my prayer . i think it would be an amazing photo to show people contemplating abortion . even though he was only 7 weeks when he died , you can see his little arms and legs forming . my 4 year old was looking through my phone when i wasn ’ t looking one day and found the picture . he came up to me with it and asked me whose baby it was . even a child can tell that at 7 weeks , the fetus is a little person .” <PARA> origins : on 27 february 2015 , the facebook page “ abby johnson : prowoman , prochild , prolife ” posted the above - quoted claim along with a <PARA> photograph that purportedly depicts a fetus miscarried at the 11 - week mark . according to the post , the pictured fetus ceased to develop past the seven - week mark , but its expulsion was delayed for an additional four weeks . <PARA> one aspect of the story that should be noted is that it was originally made anonymously and then picked up and shared on the referenced facebook page , so neither the photograph nor the accompanying description constituted a first - person account . <PARA> the claim itself is not unbelievably extraordinary . while miscarriage ( defined as a pregnancy that ends before the 20 - week mark ) is often a private tragedy whose mechanics are little understood by those who haven ’ t experienced it , passing an intact gestational sac is neither rare nor remarkable . first person tales of such experiences abound , particularly on the internet where they can be shared in relative anonymity among others who have also endured them . anecdotal online accounts of similar experiences are legion : <PARA> if your body is threatening to have a miscarriage now , i am letting you know this so that you will know what you want to do if this happens to you . if you pass the gestational sac you do not need to feel morbid , guilty or strange to want to open it and see your baby . these are completely normal and natural feelings for a mother to have , and seeing your little one may actually help you to gain some closure . if your pregnancy loss has occurred very early , you may not be able to find your baby in the sac as it may be too small for you to see . this is normal , and does not mean that you lost your baby and did not find it . it is just too small . if you were further along , you may see an actual tiny baby in the sac at the stage of development they had reached when they died . it is ok to hold them , and to look at them , and to wonder at the miracle your tiny little baby is . although it is taboo to talk of such things in our society , it is a normal and natural feeling to want to see them , hold them , and touch them . <PARA> although miscarriage is common ( roughly half of all pregnancies end in miscarriage ), discussion of its aftermath is rare . however , minor debates have erupted over whether parents should bury fetal remains following a miscarriage : <PARA> david walkinson , a spokesman for the national funeral directors association , of brookfield , wisc ., says he also is working with an increasing number of parents requesting burial or cremation for miscarriage remains . <PARA> “ twenty years ago there would be quiet graveside ceremonies for older stillborns ,” walkinson says . “ now people have grown more attached to their babies earlier . some people experience an enormous amount of sadness when they lose the pregnancy and want a cemetery service of some kind .” many funeral homes offer their services to such families without charge , he says . <PARA> it is unknown how many hospitals across the country provide counseling and the option of burial or cremation after miscarriage . anecdotally , experts say not enough hospitals do . <PARA> “ twenty years ago there would be quiet graveside ceremonies for older stillborns ,” walkinson says . “ now people have grown more attached to their babies earlier . some people experience an enormous amount of sadness when they lose the pregnancy and want a cemetery service of some kind .” many funeral homes offer their services to such families without charge , he says . <PARA> it is unknown how many hospitals across the country provide counseling and the option of burial or cremation after miscarriage . anecdotally , experts say not enough hospitals do . <PARA> development at the gestational age of seven weeks matches that shown in the photograph shared above : <PARA> by seven weeks , the embryo has grown to about 10mm long from head to bottom . this measurement is called the “ crown - rump length ”. the brain is growing rapidly and this results in the the head growing faster than the rest of the body . <PARA> the embryo has a large forehead , and the eyes and ears continue to develop . the inner ear starts to develop , but the outer ear on the side of the head won ’ t appear for a couple more weeks . <PARA> the limb buds start to form cartilage , which will develop into the bones of the legs and arms . the arm buds get longer and the ends flatten out — these will become the hands . <PARA> the embryo has a large forehead , and the eyes and ears continue to develop . the inner ear starts to develop , but the outer ear on the side of the head won ’ t appear for a couple more weeks . <PARA> the limb buds start to form cartilage , which will develop into the bones of the legs and arms . the arm buds get longer and the ends flatten out — these will become the hands . <PARA> so while the claim listed above cannot be solidly verified , it does not describe an experience out of line with some early miscarriages : <PARA> many early miscarriages simply look like heavy menstrual periods , sometimes with tiny blood clots in the discharge . if the miscarriage happened with development beyond four or five weeks gestational age , it is possible that there may be a small , transparent gestational sac with the rudimentary beginnings of a placenta on its edge . if your miscarriage happened beyond six weeks , you may pass an identifiable embryo or fetus in the early stages of development , which may be as small as a pea or larger than an orange depending on how far along you were when the baby stopped growing . ( remember that it is a good idea to see a doctor if you are miscarrying , especially if you are in the later part of the first trimester or beyond ). sometimes even in a later first - trimester miscarriage there may not be recognizable tissue , as sometimes the baby stops growing and begins to deteriorate before the onset of the miscarriage bleeding . <PARA> the assertion that fetal tissue is normally “ crushed ” by the expulsion process is inaccurate : rather , early miscarriages generally do not produce a quantity of tissue sufficient to identify as a fetus : <PARA> if you miscarry naturally or with medication , you will probably complete the miscarriage at home . the process may be over quickly or may take several days . if you are less than eight weeks pregnant when the miscarriage occurs , the expelled tissue will look no different from heavy menstrual bleeding . the further along you are in pregnancy , the heavier the bleeding and more severe the cramps . you may see the fetus and placenta .

false	a friend of mine , who was a vietnam vet , came into the house , just as i was screaming , and asked me if i had some plain old flour ... i <PARA> pulled out a bag and he stuck my hand in it . he said to keep my hand in the flour for 10 minutes . which i did . he said that in vietnam , this guy was on fire and in their panic , they threw a bag of flour all over him to put the fire out ... well , it not only put the fire out , but he never even had a blister !!!! <PARA> soooo , long story short , i put my hand in the bag of flour for 10 minutes , pulled it out and had not even a red mark or a blister and absolutely no pain . now , i keep a bag of flour in the fridge and every time i burn myself , i use the flour and never once have i ever had a red spot , a burn or a blister ! * cold flour feels even better than room temperature flour . <PARA> miracle , if you ask me . keep a bag of white flour in your fridge and you will be happy you did . i even burnt my tongue and put the flour on it for about 10 minutes . and the pain was gone and no burn . try it ! btw , don ’ t run your burn area under cold water first , just put it right into the flour for 10 minutes and experience a miracle ! <PARA> origins : this seemingly helpful heads up began making the rounds on the internet in march 2011 . the advice it provides runs contrary to all accepted knowledge about how to treat burns and thus should not be heeded . <PARA> first degree burns ( which are the least severe of the three classes of this type of injury ) can be treated at home without summoning additional medical assistance . effective first aid begins with stopping the burning process ; otherwise , the affected flesh continues to cook , further damaging the injured area . for this reason , the recommended action is to immediately immerse the burned area in cool water or under gently running cool water for a minimum of five minutes . doing so halts the burning process , numbs the pain , and prevents or reduces swelling . if the injury cannot be immersed or positioned under a faucet , cool water is to be poured over it for the same amount of time . never use ice on burns . <PARA> only after the wound has been effectively cooled should the injured area be dried off , then dressed with a clean bandage . ( bandaging can be omitted when the injury is small and there is no break in the skin .) neither butter nor oil <PARA> should ever be applied to any burn , although once the wound has been properly cooled and dried , antibiotic ointments or aloe vera gel could be applied before dressing the area . <PARA> because cooling the wound is of paramount importance , sticking a burned hand into a sack of flour would be a mistake , whether the flour has been refrigerated or not . the highest priority is to get the temperature of the injured area back down to normal , and this is not accomplished by cocooning the wound within a substance that will effectively hold the heat in place . ( similarly , salves and ointments are not applied to burns until the wounded area has fully cooled , because otherwise that which is intended to heal will instead trap the heat within the flesh , thereby allowing further damage to take place .) <PARA> interestingly , an article that appeared in a 1848 medical journal seems to offer support to the “ flour as preventative for scarring ” aspect of the e - mail ’ s story . in it , a physician recounted his experience in treating a maid servant who had had a pot of boiling water fall upon her , scalding her neck , bust and arms . said unfortunate woman was “ immediately dredged with flour , and folded up in finely carded cotton wool ,” given doses of calomel and opium , then over the next few days further dosed with sulphate of magnesia ( presumably as a laxative ). the dressing was left on for eight days , after which it was removed , taking with it “ the whole of the cuticle ” but “ leaving not the slightest abrasion or ulceration of the cutis .” <PARA> it needs be noted , however , that same article advocates the treatment of even more severely burnt patients with internal doses of “ laudanum , ammonia , and brandy ” while extolling that “ hot spirits of turpentine on flannel bandages , or poultices of spirits of turpentine and oatmeal , will form the best external application .” in other words , the advice seemingly to be gleaned from ancient medical journals should be regarded with an appropriately jaundiced eye . <PARA> as for the e - mail ’ s backstory about the way a vietnam vet happened upon this supposed miracle cure ( he and his buddies threw the contents of a bag of flour onto a guy who was on fire ), if it were true , it ’ s a wonder the fellow so doused survived . while wheat flour has no explosive properties when it ’ s sitting innocuously in a cup or dumped in a heap onto a counter , if enough of it is flung airborne , it has the potential to create a dangerous , even life - ending , blast . <PARA> the risk of dust explosions has to be carefully guarded against in places such as coal mines , grain elevators and mills , lest any more of them be left as piles of rubble , as was the washburn mill in 1878 when a blast of that sort leveled the building and took the lives of 18 people . lest anyone think the matter is a problem only of the past , said robert w . schoeff of kansas state university in 2004 , in the u . s . alone dust explosions took the lives of 16 people and injured a further 137 others between 1994 and 2003 . more recently , a 7 february 2008 explosion at the imperial sugar company refinery in georgia left 13 people dead and 42 people injured , with most of the plant destroyed . <PARA> as to what causes this sort of explosion , dust ( which is what flour becomes when it ’ s flung into the air ) has a large surface - to - mass area , and it is the surface area of materials that burns when items come into contact with an ignition source ( such as a g . i . on fire ). said bill stevenson of cv technology , a dust explosion consulting company , the “ explosive pentagon ” that works to create the phenomenon has five key components : 1 ) dust , 2 ) suspended in a cloud , 3 ) within a confined space , 4 ) enough air , 5 ) some type of ignition . <PARA> if there ’ s a bottom line to be had in all this , if you absolutely can ’ t resist trying out medical advice gained from an unsourced anonymous e - mail and must play about with flour in the wake of burning your hand , do so only after you ’ ve first fully brought the temperature of the injured area back down to normal with cool water , then dried the injured area . and never , ever toss flour onto a burning person . <PARA> barbara “ unbreaded ” mikkelson	
false	back in march 2013 , a twitter user posted an image of magic johnson ( who is hiv positive ) having blood drawn alongside the worrisome claim that johnson was “ donating blood for charity ,” a rumor which later evolved to indicate the blood was to be used for leukemia and lymphoma patients : <PARA> at the time the initial tweet began to circulate , the image was traced back to its original source , which proved to be a documentary titled endgame : aids in black america . the rumor died down until a fake news site rediscovered the picture and false attribution and ran with them , adding the embellishment about leukemia and lymphoma patients . that article stated : <PARA> the inaccurate attribution of the image of magic johnson ’ s donating blood for leukemia patients “ tipped ” on social media once again when posted to the official page of comedian d . l . hughley . while the image itself is unaltered , it shows johnson undergoing medical tests / treatment associated with his hiv - positive status , not donating blood for transfusions or organizing a blood drive in which he himself participated .	
true	origins : on 12 november 2014 , miami ( ohio ) university ’ s student newspaper , the miami student , published an article about a local walmart ’ s decision to add a halal meat section to their grocery aisles : <PARA> “ i appreciated the students bringing this interest to our attention ,” woodard said . “ i am pleased to announce that we have set a halal meat section in the store .” <PARA> visiting assistant professor tareq hasan khan and the muslim student association ( msa ) had petitioned all local grocers to carry halal meat . so far , the local walmart is the only store to have obliged to the request : <PARA> “ for halal meat , we needed to drive from oxford to cincinnati , around 40 miles one way , almost every week ,” khan said . “ this long drive is very tiresome and takes about two hours only to go to cincinnati and return back .” <PARA> this case is not the first instance of a walmart store ’ s choosing to carry halal meat : similar products have been sold at dozens of walmart stores around the u . s . since at least 2010 . still , the announcement that the oxford location had added a halal meat section stirred up anger on social media sites : <PARA> while some people viewed walmart ’ s decision to sell halal meat as proof the company was “ bowing down ” to sharia law , the associated press noted demand for halal products has been on the rise throughout the world : <PARA> although walmart has opted to offer halal meat in their oxford store , it appears it is making such decisions on a case - by - case basis rather than instituting a country - wide policy to that effect .	
true	origins : on 13 september 2013 , a video was posted to the avs forum which claimed that tbs was speeding up episodes of seinfeld in order to fit in more commercials : <PARA> my computer has a tuner card . i used this tuner card to digitally record seinfeld from fox chicago roughly 10 years ago ( i archived the entire series ). then i found which episode was on tbs tonight . in the upper - right window is a live feed from the tuner card . the source is tbs ’ s sd feed via dish network . the lower - right is video playback from the digital recording , also recorded from dish network in 2003 . i fed the audio from both the live feed and the video clip as well as the video from the s - video out on my video card to an external dvd recorder , then uploaded the final result to youtube . after 202 seconds of playback , the tbs live feed had advanced a full 15 seconds over the recording . this amounts to nearly 2 minutes over the course of a full episode . <PARA> i lined up the windows as closely as possible so you can also see cropping . between that and the extreme speed increase , tbs is butchering a classic . <PARA> while the video displayed above specifically mentions the american cable channel tbs , speeding up shows in syndication is actually a widespread practice in the television industry . <PARA> i lined up the windows as closely as possible so you can also see cropping . between that and the extreme speed increase , tbs is butchering a classic . <PARA> a may 2014 article published by the la times notes that cable networks have been giving advertisements more screen time for several years . in 2013 , for instance , networks showed 15 minutes and 38 seconds of commercials per hour of programming . this is up from 14 minutes and 27 seconds of advertising per hour in 2009 . <PARA> while this increased demand for advertising only affects current shows in terms of length , syndicated programs such as seinfeld have to be cut , edited or sped up in order to fit these new time constraints . tech times notes that the change is especially noticeable in shows from the seinfeld era which originally aired with an average runtime of around 25 minutes . in contrast , modern sitcoms such as the big bang theory can be as short as 19 minutes . <PARA> tbs has not confirmed that it sped up episodes of seinfeld in order to fit in more commercials , but the network does display an “ edited for time ” warning before some programs . <PARA> it should also be noted that while tbs may have sped up some episodes of seinfeld , it does not appear that the network does this for every syndicated show . some episodes may air as originally intended , while others may have scenes added or deleted in order to fit time constraints .

said . <PARA> “ the risks that the leader of a rogue state can use biological or chemical weapons on us or our allies is the greatest security risk we face ,” albright said . 3 <PARA> he repeatedly challenged albright on whether clinton policy is consistent or fair — attacking saddam while acting favorably to american allies charged with atrocities against their own people , such as indonesia and turkey . <PARA> albright said the united states had expressed its concerns in all of the occasions strange mentioned . “ what we ought to be thinking about is how to deal with saddam hussein ,” she added . <PARA> “ you ’ re not answering my question , madam albright !” strange shouted , causing the secretary to momentarily back from the lectern . <PARA> at that point , woodruff followed his question by asking why iraq was branded an outlaw nation for manufacturing chemical and biological weapons that other nations also possess . <PARA> “ it is a question of whether there is a proclivity to use them ,” albright said . “ saddam hussein is a repeat offender .” <PARA> many who attended yesterday ’ s town meeting , while supportive of the nation ’ s position on iraq , said they are uncertain whether a military attack is the proper response . <PARA> before the forum , rob aiken , a north side resident and student at ohio state , said he wanted to know what other options had been considered . <PARA> “ i don ’ t think killing a lot of folks will change a regime ,” he said . <PARA> leandra kennedy , a political science major from philadelphia , said her biggest concern is that an attack has not received congressional approval . <PARA> “ saddam needs to comply ,” she said . “ but i ’ m not sure about the way we ’ re going about it , not taking into consideration how it will affect the international community in the long run .” <PARA> calling saddam a bully who has terrorized his middle east neighbors and tortured his own people , the officials said the administration ’ s

the leader of a rogue state can use biological or chemical weapons on us or our allies is the greatest security risk we face ,” albright said . 3 <PARA> during that same meeting national security adviser sandy berger also spoke about how to make saddam hussein comply with united nations weapons inspectors : <PARA> berger won strong applause when he insisted washington is still hoping for a peaceful way to persuade saddam to give united nations inspectors free access to suspected weapons sites . but berger re - used a warning delivered tuesday by president bill clinton : “ the only answer to aggression and outlaw behaviour is firmness . . . he ( saddam ) will rebuild his arsenal of weapons of mass destruction and some day , some way , i am certain he will use that arsenal again , as he has 10 times since 1983 .“ 4 <PARA> on 6 october 1998 , senator carl levin of michigan , a member of the senate armed services committee , addressed that committee at a hearing on the subject of worldwide threats facing the u . s . his comments on iraq included mention of a letter to president clinton which he and other senators were circulating : <PARA> as the chairman has indicated , the situation in iraq also poses a threat to international peace and security . once again , saddam hussein has halted cooperation with the united nations special commission and the international atomic energy agency . without intrusive inspections , we will not be able to ensure that iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction programs are destroyed in accordance with u . n . security council resolutions . without those inspections , the iraqi people will continue to suffer as a result of international economic sanctions . <PARA> and that is why , along with senators mccain , lieberman , and hutchison , i am circulating among our senate colleagues a letter to president clinton , urging him , in consultation with congress , consistent with the u . s . constitution and laws , to take effective actions , including if appropriate , the use of air strikes , to respond to the iraqi threat . <PARA> and that is why , along with senators mccain , lieberman , and hutchison , i am circulating among our senate colleagues a letter to president clinton , urging him , in consultation with congress , consistent with the u . s . constitution and laws , to take effective actions , including if appropriate , the use of air strikes , to respond to the iraqi threat . <PARA> ( president clinton did undertake the action urged in this statement a few months later by ordering the aforementioned operation desert fox airstrikes .) <PARA> on 16 december 1998 , nancy pelosi , a congressional representative from california and a member of the house intelligence committee , issued a statement concerning a u . s .- led military strike against iraq : <PARA> as a member of the house intelligence committee , i am keenly aware that the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons is an issue of grave importance to all nations . saddam hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process . <PARA> the responsibility of the united states in this conflict is to eliminate weapons of mass destruction , to minimize the danger to our troops and to diminish the suffering of the iraqi people . the citizens of iraq have suffered the most for saddam hussein ’ s activities ; sadly , those same citizens now stand to suffer more . i have supported efforts to ease the humanitarian situation in iraq and my thoughts and prayers are with the innocent iraqi civilians , as well as with the families of u . s . troops participating in the current action . <PARA> i believe in negotiated solutions to international conflict . this is , unfortunately , not going to be the case in this situation where saddam hussein has been a repeat offender , ignoring the international community ’ s requirement that he come clean with his weapons program . while i support the president , i hope and pray that this conflict can be resolved quickly and that the international community can find a lasting solution through diplomatic means . <PARA> the responsibility of the united states in this conflict is to eliminate weapons of mass destruction , to minimize

order to destroy its wmd technology ; she was expressing support for attacks that had already begun with that purpose as their stated objective .) <PARA> on 10 november 1999 , secretary of state madeleine albright addressed another open meeting , this one held at the chicago hilton and towers . challenged to defend the clinton administration ’ s support of an economic and trade embargo against iraq , secretary albright responded : <PARA> if you remember in 1991 , saddam hussein invaded another country , he plagued it , he set fire to it , and he decided that he could control the region . before that , he had gassed his own people . <PARA> saddam hussein had been acquiring weapons of mass destruction . we carried out , with the help of an alliance , a war in which we put saddam hussein back into his box . the united nations voted on a set of resolutions which demanded saddam hussein live up to his obligations and get rid of weapons of mass destruction . <PARA> the united nations security council imposed a set of sanctions on saddam hussein until he did that . it also established an organization that is set up to monitor whether hussein had gotten rid of his weapons of mass destruction . <PARA> there has never been an embargo against food and medicine . it ’ s just that hussein has just not chosen to spend his money on that . instead , he has chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction , and palaces for his cronies . <PARA> saddam hussein had been acquiring weapons of mass destruction . we carried out , with the help of an

instead , he has chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction , and palaces for his cronies . <PARA> in december 2001 , nine members of congress ( a group which included both democrats and republicans ) wrote a letter to president bush urging him to step up support for the internal iraqi opposition seeking to remove saddam hussein from power . included in that letter was the following paragraph : <PARA> this december will mark three years since united nations inspectors last visited iraq . there is no doubt that since that time , saddam hussein has reinvigorated his weapons programs . reports indicate that biological , chemical and nuclear programs continue apace and may be back to pre - gulf war status . in addition , saddam continues to refine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer - range missiles that will threaten the united states and our allies . <PARA> unless the version reproduced on the department of state ’ s web site is in error , however , senator bob graham of florida was not one of the signatories to that letter . <PARA> on 19 september 2002 , senator carl levin — by then chairman of the senate armed services committee — addressed a committee hearing on u . s . policy on iraq . his introductory remarks included the following : <PARA> the armed services committee meets this afternoon to continue our hearings on u . s . policy toward iraq . the purpose of these hearings is to give the administration an opportunity to present its position on iraq , and to allow this committee to examine the administration ’ s proposal with administration witnesses and experts outside of the government . <PARA> we welcome secretary of defense donald rumsfeld and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general richard myers to the committee . next week the committee will hear from former senior military commanders on monday and from former national security officials on wednesday . <PARA> we begin with the common belief that saddam hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region . he has ignored the mandates of the united nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them . <PARA> we welcome secretary of defense donald rumsfeld and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general richard myers to the

the comments he offered there were the following : <PARA> moreover , if we quickly succeed in a war against the weakened and depleted fourth rate military of iraq and then quickly abandon that nation as president bush has abandoned afghanistan after quickly defeating a fifth rate military there , the resulting chaos could easily pose a far greater danger to the united states than we presently face from saddam . we know that he has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country . <PARA> we have no evidence , however , that he has shared any of those weapons with terrorist groups . however , if iraq came to resemble afghanistan — with no central authority but instead local and regional warlords with porous borders and infiltrating members of al qaeda than these widely dispersed supplies of weapons of mass destruction might well come into the hands of terrorist groups . <PARA> if we end the war in iraq the way we ended the war in afghanistan , we could easily be worse off than we are today . when secretary rumsfield was asked recently about what our responsibility for restabilizing iraq would be in an aftermath of an invasion , he said , “ that ’ s for the iraqis to come together and decide .” <PARA> [ . . .] <PARA> what is a potentially even more serious consequence of this push to begin a new war as quickly as possible is the damage it can do not just to america ’ s prospects to winning the war against terrorism but to america ’ s prospects for continuing the historic leadership we began providing to the world 57 years ago , right here in this city by the bay . <PARA> [ . . .] <PARA> nevertheless , iraq does pose a serious threat to the stability of the persian gulf and we should organize an international coalition to eliminate his access to weapons of mass destruction . iraq ’ s search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to completely deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as saddam is in power . moreover , no international law can prevent the united states from taking actions to protect its vital interests , when it is manifestly clear that there is a choice to be made between law and survival . i believe , however , that such a choice is not presented in the case of iraq . indeed , should we decide to proceed , that action can be justified within the framework of international law rather than outside it . in fact , though a new un resolution may be helpful in building international consensus , the existing resolutions from 1991 are sufficient from a legal standpoint . <PARA> we

johns hopkins school of advanced international studies . an excerpt from that speech includes the following statements : <PARA> we have known for many years that saddam hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction . our intelligence community is also deeply concerned about the acquisition of such weapons by iran , north korea , libya , syria and other nations . but information from the intelligence community over the past six months does not point to iraq as an imminent threat to the united states or a major proliferator of weapons of mass destruction . <PARA> in public hearings before the senate armed services committee in march , cia director george tenet described iraq as a threat but not as a proliferator , saying that saddam hussein — and i quote — “ is determined to thwart u . n . sanctions , press ahead with weapons of mass destruction , and resurrect the military force he had before the gulf war .” that is unacceptable , but it is also possible that it could be stopped short of war . <PARA> in public hearings before the senate armed services committee in march , cia director george tenet described iraq as a threat but not as a proliferator ,

that is unacceptable , but it is also possible that it could be stopped short of war . <PARA> in october 2002 , as the u . s . senate debated joint resolution 46 authorizing president george w . bush to use military force against iraq , senator robert byrd of west virginia delivered remarks regarding his belief that the “ rush to war ” was “ ignoring the u . s . constitution ” and that iraq did not pose an imminent threat to the united states . among his remarks were the following statements : <PARA> the senate is rushing to vote on whether to declare war on iraq without pausing to ask why . why is war being dealt with not as a last resort but as a first resort ? why is congress being pressured to act now , as of today , 33 days before a general election when a third of the senate and the entire house of representatives are in the final , highly politicized , weeks of election campaigns ? as recently as tuesday ( oct . 1 ), the president said he had not yet made up his mind about whether to go to war with iraq . and yet congress is being exhorted to give the president open - ended authority now , to exercise whenever he pleases , in the event that he decides to invade iraq . why is congress elbowing past the president to authorize a military campaign that the president may or may not even decide to pursue ? aren ’ t we getting ahead of ourselves ? <PARA> the last un weapons inspectors left iraq in october of 1998 . we are confident that saddam hussein retained some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons , and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capability . intelligence reports also indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons , but has not yet achieved nuclear capability . it is now october of 2002 . four years have gone by in which neither this administration nor the previous one felt compelled to invade iraq to protect against the imminent threat of weapons of mass destruction . until today . until 33 days until election day . now we are being told that we must act immediately , before adjournment and before the elections . why the rush ? <PARA> yes , we had september 11 . but we must not make the mistake of looking at the resolution before us as just another offshoot of the war on terror . we know who was behind the september 11 attacks on the united states . we know it was osama bin laden and his al qaeda terrorist network . we have dealt with al qaeda and with the taliban government that sheltered it — we have routed them from afghanistan and we are continuing to pursue them in hiding . <PARA> so where does iraq enter the equation ? no one in the administration has been able to produce any solid evidence linking iraq to the september 11 attack . iraq had biological and chemical weapons long before september 11 . we knew it then , and we know it now . iraq has been an enemy of the united states for more than a decade . if saddam hussein is such an imminent threat to the united states , why hasn ’ t he attacked us already ? the fact that osama bin laden attacked the united states does not , de facto , mean that saddam hussein is now in a lock and load position and is readying an attack on the united states . in truth , there is nothing in the deluge of administration rhetoric over iraq that is of such moment that it would preclude the senate from setting its own timetable and taking the time for a thorough and informed discussion of this crucial issue . <PARA> the last un weapons inspectors left iraq in october of 1998 . we are

: <PARA> when i vote to give the president of the united states the authority to use force , if necessary , to disarm saddam hussein , it is because i believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a threat , and a grave threat , to our security and that of our allies in the persian gulf region . i will vote yes because i believe it is the best way to hold saddam hussein accountable . and the administration , i believe , is now committed to a recognition that war must be the last option to address this threat , not the first , and that we must act in concert with allies around the globe to make the world ’ s case against saddam hussein . <PARA> let me be clear , the vote i will give to the president is for one reason and one reason only : to disarm iraq of weapons of mass destruction , if we cannot accomplish that objective through new , tough weapons inspections in joint concert with our allies . <PARA> in giving the president this authority , i expect him to fulfill the commitments he has made to the american people in recent days — to work with the united nations security council to adopt a new resolution setting out tough and immediate inspection requirements , and to act with our allies at our side if we have to disarm saddam hussein by force . if he fails to do so , i will be among the first to speak out . <PARA> if we do wind up going to war with iraq , it is imperative that we do so with others in the international community , unless there is a showing of a grave , imminent — and i emphasize “ imminent ” — threat to this country which requires the president to respond in a way that protects our immediate national security needs . <PARA> prime minister tony blair has recognized a similar need to distinguish how we approach this . he has said that he believes we should move in concert with allies , and he has promised his own party that he will not do so otherwise . the administration may not be in the habit of building coalitions , but that is what they need to do . and it is what can be done . if we go it alone without reason , we risk inflaming an entire region , breeding a new generation of terrorists , a new cadre of anti - american zealots , and we will be less secure , not more secure , at the end of the day , even with saddam hussein disarmed . <PARA> let there be no doubt or confusion about where we stand on this . i will support a multilateral effort to disarm him by force , if we ever exhaust those other options , as the president has promised , but i will not support a unilateral u . s . war against iraq unless that threat is imminent and the multilateral effort has not proven possible under any circumstances . <PARA> in voting to grant the president the authority , i am not giving him carte blanche to run roughshod over every country that poses or may pose some kind of potential threat to the united states . every nation has the right to act preemptively , if it faces an imminent and grave threat , for its self - defense under the standards of law . the threat we face today with iraq does not meet that test yet . i emphasize “ yet .” yes , it is grave because of the deadliness of saddam hussein ’ s arsenal and the very high probability that he might use these weapons one day if not disarmed . but it is not imminent , and no one in the cia , no intelligence briefing we have had suggests it is imminent . none of our intelligence reports suggest that he is about to launch an attack . <PARA> the argument for going to war against iraq is rooted in

unmistakable evidence that saddam hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years . and that may happen sooner if he can obtain access to enriched uranium from foreign sources — something that is not that difficult in the current world . we also should remember we have always underestimated the progress saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction . <PARA> when saddam hussein obtains nuclear capabilities , the constraints he feels will diminish dramatically , and the risk to america ’ s homeland ,

international law and initiate unprovoked attacks when he feels it serves his purposes to do so . <PARA> the global community — in the form of the united nations — has declared repeatedly , through

california issued a statement on a possible war with iraq : <PARA> whether one agrees or disagrees with the administration ’ s policy towards iraq , i don ’ t think there can be any question about saddam ’ s conduct . he has systematically violated , over the course of the past 11 years , every significant un resolution that has demanded that he disarm and destroy his chemical and biological weapons , and any nuclear capacity . this he has refused to do . he lies and cheats ; he snubs the mandate and authority of international weapons inspectors ; and he games the system to keep buying time against enforcement of the just and legitimate demands of the united nations , the security council , the united states and our allies . those are simply the facts . <PARA> and now , time has run out . it has been four long years since the last un weapons inspectors were effectively ejected from iraq because of saddam ’ s willful noncompliance with an effective inspection regime . <PARA> what saddam has done in the interim is not known for certain – but there is every evidence , from the dossier prepared by the prime minister of britain , to president bush ’ s speech at the united nations , that saddam has rebuilt substantial chemical and biological weapons stocks , and that he is determined to obtain the means necessary to produce nuclear weapons . he has ballistic missiles , and more are on order . he traffics with other evil people in this world , intent on harming the united states , israel , other nations in the middle east , and our friends across the globe . <PARA> and now ,

. <PARA> senator hillary clinton of new york also spoke on the issue of the iraq resolution : <PARA> in the four years since the inspectors left , intelligence reports show that saddam hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock , his missile delivery capability , and his nuclear program . he has also given aid , comfort , and sanctuary to terrorists , including al qaeda members , though there is apparently no evidence of his involvement in the terrible events of september 11 , 2001 . <PARA> it is clear , however , that if left unchecked , saddam hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare , and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons . should he succeed in that endeavor , he could alter the political and security landscape of the middle east , which as we know all too well affects american security . <PARA> now this much is undisputed . the open questions are : what should we do about it ? how , when , and with whom ? <PARA> some people favor attacking saddam hussein now , with any allies we can muster , in the belief that one more round of weapons inspections would not produce the required disarmament , and that deposing saddam would be a positive good for the iraqi people and would create the possibility of a secular democratic state in the middle east , one which could perhaps move the entire region toward democratic reform . <PARA> this view has appeal to some , because it would assure disarmament ; because it would right old wrongs after our abandonment of the shiites and kurds in 1991 , and our support for saddam hussein in the 1980 ’ s when he was using chemical weapons and terrorizing his people ; and because it would give the iraqi people a chance to build a future in freedom . <PARA> however , this course is fraught with danger . we and our nato allies did not depose mr . milosevic , who was responsible for more than a quarter of a million people being killed in the 1990s . instead , by stopping his aggression in bosnia and kosovo , and keeping on the tough sanctions , we created the conditions in which his own people threw him out and led to his being in the dock being tried for war crimes as we speak . <PARA> if we were to attack iraq now , alone or with few allies , it would set a precedent that could come back to haunt us . in recent days , russia

<PARA> so mr . president , for all its appeal , a unilateral attack , while it cannot be ruled out , on the present facts is not a good option . <PARA> it is clear , however , that if left unchecked ,

georgetown university on 23 january 2003 , during the build - up to the war with iraq , senator john kerry said : <PARA> second , without question , we need to disarm saddam hussein . he is a brutal , murderous dictator , leading an oppressive regime . we all know the litany of his offenses . he presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation . he miscalculated an eight - year war with iran . he miscalculated the invasion of kuwait . he miscalculated america ’ s response to that act of naked aggression . he miscalculated the result of setting oil rigs on fire . he miscalculated the impact of sending scuds into israel and trying to assassinate an american president . he miscalculated his own military strength . he miscalculated the arab world ’ s response to his misconduct . and now he is miscalculating america ’ s response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction . that is why the world , through the united nations security council , has spoken with one voice , demanding that iraq disclose its weapons programs and disarm . <PARA> so the threat of saddam hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real , but it is not new . it has been with us since the end of the persian gulf war . regrettably the current administration failed to take the opportunity to bring this issue to the united nations two years ago or immediately after september 11th , when we had such unity of spirit with our allies . when it finally did speak , it was with hasty war talk instead of a coherent call for iraqi disarmament . and that made it possible for other arab regimes to shift their focus to the perils of war for themselves rather than keeping the focus on the perils posed by saddam ’ s deadly arsenal . indeed , for a time , the administration ’ s unilateralism , in effect , elevated saddam in the eyes of his neighbors to a level he never would have achieved on his own , undermining america ’ s standing with most of the coalition partners which had joined us in repelling the invasion of kuwait a decade ago . <PARA> in u . n . security council resolution 1441 , the united nations has now affirmed that saddam hussein must disarm or face the most serious consequences . let me make it clear that the burden is resoundingly on saddam hussein to live up to the ceasefire agreement he signed and make clear to the world how he disposed of weapons he previously admitted to possessing . but the burden is also clearly on the bush administration to do the hard work of building a broad coalition at the u . n . and the necessary work of educating america about the rationale for war . as i have said frequently and repeat here today , the united states should never go to war because it wants to , the united states should go to war because we have to . and we don ’ t have to until we have exhausted the remedies available , built legitimacy and earned the consent of the american people , absent , of course , an imminent threat requiring urgent action . <PARA> so the threat of saddam hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real , but it is not new . it has been with us

false	sagging , the fashion of wearing pants with their waistbands around the hips ( or lower ) rather than snugged to the midriff , has been and continues to be a controversial style of dress . although this sartorial fad is overwhelmingly favored by young males , it is not limited to them — young women have at times likewise indulged in the urge to sag . <PARA> the practice , which did begin in prisons , worked its way from the hoosegow into hip hop culture . it was adopted by a variety of rap artists , such as ice - t and too short , which enhanced its perceived tough - guy cachet . sagging can even be taken a step further by wearing the droopy breeches backwards . ( totally krossed out , the 1992 debut album of kriss kross , shows the pair of 13 - year - old rappers doing this .) by 1995 the style had seeped into mainstream teen culture — one no longer needed to be a wannabe “ gangsta ” to sling ’ em low . <PARA> pants worn this way are kept up by constant hitching , an act that becomes an integral part of the walking style of the wearer . <PARA> sagging did gain its start in the u . s . prison system and is now frequently claimed to have originated as a clothes - wearing style authored by imprisoned homosexuals intent upon advertising their interest in casual flings : <PARA> sagging pants became the behind - the - bars thing thanks to ill - fitting prison - issue garb : some of those incarcerated were provided with clothing a few sizes too large . that oversizing , coupled with the lack of belts in the big house , led to a great number of jailbirds whose pants were falling off their arses . ( belts are not permitted in most correctional facilities because all too often the lifeless bodies of their inmate owners have been found hanging from them .) <PARA> sagging has another rumored origin ( also false ), one less well - traveled than the “ gay inmates advertising for sex ” postulation : <PARA> another discredited theory says ghetto hoodlums adopted the fashion of wearing their pants in the sagging style to better conceal weapons from rival gang members and police . while it is true a gun or knife can be effectively stashed out of sight in droopy pants , it can also be hidden in more form - fitting bottoms , especially when the pants - wearer tops his cache with an untucked sports jersey , pullover , or sweatshirt . <PARA> the most intriguing aspect of the “ trolling for gay sex ” rumor lies not in its veracity , but in its acceptance as gospel by those who encounter it and who are then moved to pass it along to others . while the combination of two facts ( homosexuality in prison and falling - down pants worn by inmates ) accounts for the origin of the belief that links the one to the other , its spread is attributable to the prevailing dislike of the fashion . those who choose to wear their pants this way cite comfort as their motive and so find justification for this imitation of rap stars and felons , two groups perceived as toughly self - sufficient and therefore worthy of emulation ; those who do not follow this fashion see only the crotches of jeans hanging at or above the knee , hobbling their wearers in a goofy manner . ( one can walk in sagging pants . but one can ’ t run in them .) <PARA> the rumor becomes a way of passing along one group ’ s disdain for another ’ s sartorial practice . communicating that the saggers are unwittingly offering their backsides to all takers when they think they are mimicking admired rappers and identifying with tough guys no sensible person would mess with becomes a way of saying “ the joke is really on them .” this same sense of surreptitious delight over being in on a prank someone looked down upon is unknowingly playing on himself fuels another urban legend that involves medallions flaunted by society matrons or chinese character - emblazoned sweaters proudly worn by their knitters and even some of the “ misunderstood souvenir ” tales told about globe - trotting tourists . <PARA> while sagging is embraced by a number of young people , it is far removed from being the subject of widespread approval outside that demographic . various communities have attempted to ban this form of fashion statement . in february 2005 , for example , the virginia house of delegates passed the so - called droopy drawers bill , legislation that would have imposed a $ 50 fine on people who wore their pants so that their underwear was visible in a “ lewd or indecent manner .” that bill was killed by a senate committee two days later . in may 2004 , louisiana lawmakers attempted to say no to plumber ’ s crack by passing house bill 1626 , legislation that would have made it a crime to wear clothing in public that “ intentionally exposes undergarments or intentionally exposes any portion of the pubic hair , cleft of the buttocks or genitals .” that bill was also rejected by the state ’ s senate .	
false	origins : on 8 february 2015 , the internet chronicle web site published an article claiming ukrainian government officials had confirmed the detection of a nuclear blast in that country , with the suggestion the blast originated with a weapon employed by russian forces : <PARA> ukrainian government officials confirmed a nuclear blast was detected in ukraine sunday . no other news is coming out of the area . <PARA> three videos just uploaded show the small nuclear blast below . nothing more is known at this time , including who launched the weapon or against which target . <PARA> the materials appear to have originated from the war - torn region of ukraine , where separatists are attempting to return control of the former soviet nation to russia . <PARA> the attack comes after britain ’ s defense minister voiced concerns russia may have “ lowered the threshold ” for using nuclear weapons . <PARA> in their criticisms , britain warned russia ’ s nuclear strategy was being integrated with conventional forces in “ a rather threatening way .” <PARA> russia ’ s new military doctrine reserves the right to use nuclear weapons in a conventional attack that endangers the state ’ s existence , but some in the military were reportedly calling for a “ first strike option .” <PARA> the article was accompanied by videos of the purported blast , such as the following <PARA> however , what this video actually showed was the explosion of a ukraine chemical plant in donetsk that was hit by artillery fire on the evening of 8 february 2015 in fighting between forces loyal to kiev and russian - backed separatist militias . the resultant blast produced a mushroom cloud resembling those typically seen after nuclear weapons testing : <PARA> the explosion took place late on sunday night near a chemical plant that has been targeted repeatedly by ukrainian forces since september . <PARA> the bombing briefly turned night into day and produced a mushroom cloud commonly seen after nuclear weapons testing . <PARA> no reports of casualties have yet emerged , despite the bombing shattering windows and shaking building foundations in towns up to 6km from the blast .	
false	viewers in many parts of england suddenly saw an identification card for tv station klee of houston , texas appear on their screens one day . several viewers took pictures of the image to prove the happening , but when british broadcasting engineers advised klee in houston of the unusual event , they were told that the station had been off the air since 1950 . no klee identification card had been shown for the past three years . <PARA> where had the picture been for three years ? why did it appear only in england and how did it get back from wherever it had been ? it makes you wonder , doesn ’ t it ? <PARA> origins : many baby boomers have come across the spooky anecdote about houston television station klee somewhere or other . it appeared in the december 1958 issue of <PARA> reader ’ s digest and has since been reprinted in numerous reader ’ s digest anthologies and countless volumes of “ strange - but - true ” stories . <PARA> as an intriguing bit of “ weird science ,” this one is hard to beat . that viewers across the atlantic could pick up signals from an american tv station in those pre - satellite days was remarkable enough , but from a station that had been off the air for more than two years ? imagine the possibilities ! if all those radio and tv signals we ’ d been beaming around for decades never really went away , perhaps we could eavesdrop on broadcasts from earlier eras ; maybe sit at home and enjoy an evening listening to amos ‘ n ’ andy or the 1934 world series . and if radio waves kept bouncing around for years and years without dissipating , maybe other intelligent beings in the universe were enjoying old episodes of “ the honeymooners ” and “ i love lucy ” and marking down earth as a place they just had to visit . small wonder this story was eagerly told and re - told and cited in innumerable ufo - related books . <PARA> the tale of the mysterious tv signal is just another entry in the “ too good to be true ” column , however . the whole thing was a hoax . <PARA> the saga began when station kprc - tv in houston received a letter from england addressed to the president of klee . it read : <PARA> enclosed herewith is a photograph taken by an ordinary box camera of what i believe is your test signal received 3 : 50 p . m . 14 september 1953 . it would be of great interest and help if you could be so kind as to confirm or deny by return mail that this is so and at the same time it would be of great help if you would endorse the back of the photograph and return . your help in this matter would be much appreciated . <PARA> kprc ’ s chief engineer was baffled . how a tv signal originating in houston could have been received all the way in england was puzzling enough , but an even bigger mystery was how anyone could have seen the identification card shown in the photograph : klee had been bought by the houston post and renamed kprc in mid - 1950 , and its call sign had not been used since . <PARA> kprc initially pursued the possibility that what english viewers had seen was actually an advertisement for kleenex brand facial tissues , but this theory failed to pan out . the bbc looked into the matter but was unable to definitively confirm or disprove it . ( why the fundamental incompatibility between american tv signals and british television sets didn ’ t immediately indicate to the investigators that the whole thing was a hoax remains puzzling .) when engineers from the chrysler corporation in america investigated and declared the pictures to be valid , the tale entered the world of reader ’ s digest lore and became forever embedded in the minds of millions of readers as a “ verified true story .” <PARA> although the folks at kprc could not have known at the time , several clues pointed to the whole affair ’ s being a hoax . what kprc had received <PARA> was in a fact a form letter ; many other american stations had received similar letters with photographs reporting sightings of their own identification cards as well . kprc was the only station whose call letters had changed in the previous few years , however , providing a hint that whoever was sending the letters was working with slightly out - of - date information . the letters were also suspect because they never included anything but photographs of station call signs ; they showed no pictures taken from broadcast programs or commercials . finally , many of the pictures were similar but not identical to the stations ’ identification cards ; in some cases there were subtle differences that couldn ’ t be completely explained by poor reception or bad photography . <PARA> the reply to kprc ’ s correspondence with the english observer who had sent them the photograph of their call sign eventually revealed the workings of the hoax . their letter was answered by a business partner of the observer , who disclosed that they were engaged in an enterprise to build “ highly sensitive super - heterodyne ” television sets capable of receiving signals over great distances , all without the need of antennae . the hoaxsters ’ tv sets did no such thing , of course , but they weren ’ t going to let such petty details dissuade them from fooling others into believing it . somehow they obtained photographs or other likenesses of call signs from tv stations in the usa ( as well as france , south america , and the soviet union ), reproduced them , and projected the images onto the screen of their fabulous “ invention ” for a select audience of credulous viewers . they then encouraged their guests to take pictures as proof of their amazing achievements in long - range reception and send them to the host stations for verification . this explained why their sets never “ received ” anything other than images of station identification cards : faking actual broadcasts with moving images was too difficult a feat for them to pull off , and the reception of nothing but call signs meant they didn ’ t have to concoct any explanations for the lack of sound . one giveaway revealed by their collection of photographs was that the soviet tv station whose signal they had allegedly received was apparently broadcasting its call signal in english ! <PARA> ( note the subtle distortions in the original story . although it may have been literally true that viewers from “ many different parts of england ” saw the klee signal , they all saw it in the same place , on the very same tv set . and klee hadn ’ t technically been “ off the air ” for three years ; the station had merely changed ownership and call letters in the interim .) <PARA> kprc learned all about this scam in good time , but as usual the mundane truth did not receive nearly as much publicity as the sensational original story . nearly half a century later , a good many people still believe this to be one of our time ’ s most baffling “ unsolved mysteries .”	
mixture	origins : in july 2013 , brandon huber , an employee at a golden corral restaurant in port orange , florida , posted a video on youtube showing trays of fly - covered meat ( hamburger and baby back ribs ) and other food stacked in trays next to dumpsters in a trash enclosure . according to huber , the food was placed out there by the restaurant ’ s managers in order to keep it out of sight of health inspectors who were currently visiting the restaurant : “ apparently , what my company likes to do when they get ready for inspection is put the food by the dumpsters .” <PARA> in a follow - up video , huber claimed the food shown in the trash enclosure would be returned to the restaurant after the health inspectors departed : “ i ’ m scared of my employment . i don ’ t know who to tell but i don ’ t want to cook this food . i don ’ t feel safe with it . my <PARA> management is gonna wheel it back into the coolers after the inspection , like nothing happened ... i will show this to whoever i can to prevent any food - borne illnesses from spreading .” the youtube channel on which the video was posted also includes images of e - mails purportedly exchanged between huber and his superiors discussing issues with improper food storage and hygiene . <PARA> eric holm at metro corral partners , a franchisee who owns the restaurant shown in the video ( as well as several other golden corral locations in florida and georgia ) issued a statement maintaining that none of the food shown in the video was served to customers and was all destroyed shortly afterwards . the statement also asserted huber knew the food had been destroyed rather than used because he participated in its disposal and claimed huber ’ s father had attempted to sell the video for thousands of dollars : <PARA> a video was recently posted showing an incident of improper food handling at our port orange , fla ., location . none of these items were served to a single customer . all were destroyed within the hour at the direction of management . brandon huber , the employee who made the video , participated in the disposal of the food . the following day , the father of the employee , posted an offer to sell the video for $ 5 , 000 , which was not accepted . the manager involved in the improper storage was terminated for failing to follow approved food handling procedures <PARA> eric holm also posted a statement on the company ’ s web site again asserting that the food shown in the video had been disposed of and not been served to customers . he reiterated that brandon huber knew this before he posted his video ( and that the personnel who were visiting the restaurant at the time were golden corral company representatives and not county health inspectors ): <PARA> golden corral corporation and i take great pride in maintaining high standards of food quality , sanitation and guest experience . the port orange incident was a result of the associate manager making a bad decision to improperly store food when the corporate inspector made a routine , unannounced visit to the restaurant . i apologize that a member of my management team made this bad decision . to be clear , this inspection was conducted by golden corral corporation . brandon huber did notify my area manager of the issue , and we acted swiftly to dispose of all the improperly stored foods . no guest was served any of this food that was handled improperly . <PARA> brandon huber actually assisted in the disposal of the food items the day before he posted the videos . i am personally disappointed that mr . huber chose to post the videos and make false statements after the situation was corrected . <PARA> i have a fantastic team of 110 hard - working people at the port orange restaurant . again , i apologize for this unfortunate incident . <PARA> brandon huber actually assisted in the disposal of the food items the day before he posted the videos . i am personally disappointed that mr . huber chose to post the videos and make false statements after the situation was corrected . <PARA> i have a fantastic team of 110 hard - working people at the port orange restaurant . again , i apologize for this unfortunate incident . <PARA> ( some viewers have suggested that the fact that the food shown in the trash enclosure was still in trays outside the dumpsters rather than thrown into those trash receptacles indicates it would have been returned to the restaurant had a higher level of management not intervened first . however , it ’ s also possible the food was quickly wheeled into the enclosure as the most expeditious way of getting it out of sight , and it would have been tossed into the dumpsters later as time permitted .) <PARA> the best scenario we can put together from these disparate accounts is that an associate manager at the golden corral restaurant in port orange knew the restaurant was either storing food improperly or was storing food of unacceptable quality , so when company inspectors unexpectedly showed up at the restaurant , the associate manager made the ( unwise ) choice of getting the offending food out of sight of the inspectors by having it placed outside in a trash enclosure . employee brandon huber notified area management of what was going on , and someone higher up the management chain intervened ( presumably after the inspection was complete ) and ensured that the food in question was disposed of , not returned to the restaurant and served to guests . the associate manager responsible for the incident was fired , although it ’ s not clear whether that action was taken before or after the incident was publicized on the internet . <PARA> whether the employee who posted the video knew ( as claimed by management ) that the food he captured in his video had truly been thrown away rather than returned to the restaurant , and ( if that was the case ) what his motivations for suggesting otherwise might have been , are open questions — as is the issue of how indicative this incident is of practices at golden corral restaurants .	
false	origins : when groucho , chico , and harpo emerged from semi - retirement in 1945 to create the last marx brothers movie , a spoof of spy / intrigue dramas titled a night in casablanca ( all three subsequently appeared in 1950 ’ s love happy , but that film was primarily a harpo marx vehicle in which his brothers had supporting roles rather than a <PARA> true marx brothers film ), the stage was set for one of the twentieth century ’ s most celebrated epistolary exchanges . the ensuing fusillade of letters between a fractious groucho and the befuddled legal department at warner bros . has since become a classic of the personal correspondence genre , but the battlefield wasn ’ t quite as level as legend would have it . <PARA> what the public heard was that the marx brothers ’ film was to be called a night in casablanca , and that the humorless heads of warner bros ., aghast at the thought that one of their fine films ( the 1942 humphrey bogart classic , casablanca ) might somehow be associated with a lowbrow , similarly - titled marx brothers vehicle , decided to launch a pre - emptive strike by claiming ownership of the word ‘ casablanca ’ ( for movie title purposes , at least ), and threatening to sue the marxes if they persisted in using it . and what the public saw was a series of letters in which a typically sarcastic , freely associating groucho deftly skewered the warners ’ alleged pretentiousness and arrogance , the first missive of which read as follows : <PARA> apparently there is more than one way of conquering a city and holding it as your own . for example , up to the time that we contemplated making this picture , i had no idea that the city of casablanca belonged exclusively to warner brothers . however , it was only a few days after our announcement appeared that we received your long , ominous legal document warning us not to use the name casablanca . <PARA> it seems that in 1471 , ferdinand balboa warner , your great - great - grandfather , while looking for a shortcut to the city of burbank , had stumbled on the shores of africa and , raising his alpenstock ( which he later turned in for a hundred shares of common ), named it casablanca . <PARA> i just don ’ t understand your attitude . even if you plan on [ re -] releasing your picture , i am sure that the average movie fan could learn in time to distinguish between ingrid bergman and harpo . i don ’ t know whether i could , but i certainly would like to try . <PARA> you claim that you own casablanca and that no one else can use that name without permission . what about “ warner brothers ”? do you own that too ? you probably have the right to use the name warner , but what about the name brothers ? professionally , we were brothers long before you were . we were touring the sticks as the marx brothers when vitaphone was still a gleam in the inventor ’ s eye , and even before there had been other brothers — the smith brothers ; the brothers karamazov ; dan brothers , an outfielder with detroit ; and “ brother , can you spare a dime ?” ( this was originally “ brothers , can you spare a dime ?” but this was spreading a dime pretty thin , so they threw out one brother , gave all the money to the other one , and whittled it down to “ brother , can you spare a dime ?”) <PARA> now jack , how about you ? do you maintain that yours is an original name ? well it ’ s not . it was used long before you were born . offhand , i can think of two jacks — jack of “ jack and the beanstalk ,” and jack the ripper , who cut quite a figure in his day . <PARA> as for you , harry , you probably sign your checks sure in the belief that you are the first harry of all time and that all other harrys are impostors . i can think of two harrys that preceded you . there was lighthouse harry of revolutionary fame and a harry appelbaum who lived on the corner of 93rd street and lexington avenue . unfortunately , appelbaum wasn ’ t too well - known . the last i heard of him , he was selling neckties at weber and heilbroner . <PARA> now about the burbank studio . i believe this is what you brothers call your place . old man burbank is gone . perhaps you remember him . he was a great man in a garden . his wife often said luther had ten green thumbs . what a witty woman she must have been ! burbank was the wizard who crossed all those fruits and vegetables until he had the poor plants in such confused and jittery condition that they could never decide whether to enter the dining room on the meat platter or the dessert dish . <PARA> this is pure conjecture , of course , but who knows — perhaps burbank ’ s survivors aren ’ t too happy with the fact that a plant that grinds out pictures on a quota settled in their town , appropriated burbank ’ s name and uses it as a front for their films . it is even possible that the burbank family is prouder of the potato produced by the old man than they are of the fact that your studio emerged “ casablanca ” or even “ gold diggers of 1931 .” <PARA> this all seems to add up to a pretty bitter tirade , but i assure you it ’ s not meant to . i love warners . some of my best friends are warner brothers . it is even possible that i am doing you an injustice and that you , yourselves , know nothing about this dog - in - the - wanger attitude . it wouldn ’ t surprise me at all to discover that the heads of your legal department are unaware of this absurd dispute , for i am acquainted with many of them and they are fine fellows with curly black hair , double - breasted suits and a love of their fellow man that out - saroyans saroyan . <PARA> i have a hunch that his attempt to prevent us from using the title is the brainchild of some ferret - faced shyster , serving a brief apprenticeship in your legal department . i know the type well — hot out of law school , hungry for success , and too ambitious to follow the natural laws of promotion . this bar sinister probably needled your attorneys , most of whom are fine fellows with curly black hair , double - breasted suits , etc ., into attempting to enjoin us . well , he won ’ t get away with it ! we ’ ll fight him to the highest court ! no pasty - faced legal adventurer is going to cause bad blood between the warners and the marxes . we are all brothers under the skin , and we ’ ll remain friends till the last reel of “ a night in casablanca ” goes tumbling over the spool . <PARA> sincerely , <PARA> groucho marx <PARA> what the public didn ’ t hear was that in its original conception , a night in casablanca was intended to be a send - up of warners ’ casablanca , complete with characters bearing names such as “ humphrey bogus .” warner bros ., having gotten wind of the marx brothers ’ plan , was legitimately concerned that a spoof of one of its films , featuring characters with names similar to those who appeared in the original , and bearing a similar title , might indeed confuse the public or otherwise infringe warners ’ intellectual rights . accordingly , its legal department made some rumbling noises and demanded to know the details about the story line of the marxes ’ upcoming film , which prompted some even more bizarre responses from groucho : <PARA> there isn ’ t much i can tell you about the story . in it i play a doctor of divinity who ministers to the natives and , as a sideline , hawks can openers and pea jackets to the savages along the gold coast of africa . <PARA> when i first meet chico , he is working in a saloon , selling sponges to barflies who are unable to carry their liquor . harpo is an arabian caddie who lives in a small grecian urn on the outskirts of the city . <PARA> dear brothers : <PARA> since i last wrote you , i regret to say there have been some changes in the plot of our new picture , “ a night in casablanca .” in the new version i play bordello , the sweetheart of humphrey bogart . harpo and chico are itinerant rug peddlers who are weary of laying rugs and enter a monastery just for a lark . this is a good joke on them , as there hasn ’ t been a lark in the place for fifteen years . <PARA> the public also didn ’ t hear that the claim warner bros . was threatening to sue the marx brothers simply for using the word ‘ casablanca ’ was purely a publicity stunt concocted by the marxes themselves , who leaked the story to select columnists as a means of generating controversy and garnering some newspaper coverage for their film . when the marxes ’ family physician , dr . samuel salinger , wrote to groucho and mentioned he ’ d heard warner bros . was barring them from using the title a night in casablanca , groucho replied to him thusly : <PARA> what eventually happened was not that warner bros . sued the marxes , but that the studio finally gave up in exasperation at being unable to glean any details about the plot or setting of a night in casablanca from the marxes , and the matter was dropped when the marx brothers movie turned into a general spoof of casablanca - like films rather than a parody of casablanca itself . by then , however , the marxes had succeeded in making warner bros . look like humorless fools while generating plenty of free publicity for their own film , and the fact that the controversy was a deliberately manufactured one will undoubtedly always remain a secondary detail .

false	apparently , he is under the impression that putting a car battery on a concrete floor would drain it ! not only that , but that the battery would not “ take a charge ” after this occurred . <PARA> origins : much of what makes a car go remains an arcane mystery to the average person . automobiles are large and complex , and as any car owner quickly discovers , malfunction of even the smallest and most seemingly unimportant automotive part can be all that it takes to render them inoperative . <PARA> tidbits of whispered wisdom therefore prove popular among the less than automotively inclined , who look to keep their vehicles running even if they ’ re not quite sure exactly how to go about that . <PARA> one bit of whispered wisdom dictates that a car ’ s battery must never be stored on a concrete or cement floor . the reasons given for this prohibition vary depending on whom one hears the admonition from . acid leaking from the battery will ruin the floor , say some . or a battery left sitting on such surface will never again properly hold a charge . or those particular surfaces will cause a battery to lose some of its charge . <PARA> oddly , the reality behind this peculiar automotive belief somewhat mirrors the long - standing urban legend about a mysterious and seemingly nonsensical cooking practice <PARA> handed down through three generations : just as there was once something to grandma ’ s oddball cooking secret , so too was there a time when storing car batteries on concrete or cement floors was a lousy thing to do . however ( and again just like the “ cooking secret ” legend ), whereas at one time there was good reason for the practice , those days have long since passed . <PARA> car batteries used to be encased in hard rubber , a substance that was porous enough that battery acid could seep through it and create a conductive path through the damp concrete , draining the battery . the cases of today ’ s batteries , however , are made of sturdier stuff that far better contains their contents than those of yesteryear . as well , time has brought technological improvements to the seals around the posts and the vent systems . <PARA> these days , the problem of car battery electrolyte seepage and migration has been all but eliminated . says battery manufacturer yuasa , “ nowadays , containers are made from a solid plastic that does not allow any current to flow through it , so the batteries do not discharge , even if they sit in a few inches of water .” <PARA> interestingly , some experts ( including car talk ’ s click and clack ) believe that storing car batteries on concrete floors might actually be a better idea than keeping them on shelves or other surfaces because the cold of the floor works to slow the self - discharge ( leakage ) rate . <PARA> barbara “ cold comfort ” mikkelson	
false	origins : on 24 january 2015 , the web site viralnova published a seemingly innocent photograph of a young woman sitting on her bed . <PARA> the image was accompanied by a supposed backstory , republished below , as well instructions for the viewer to search for something askew ( hint : the corner of a man ’ s face can be seen between the mattress and the bed frame ): <PARA> however , this photograph has been circulating around the internet accompanied by a number of different explanations and backstories , including versions posted to the chinese - language sites jdduanzi and liuxing with a slightly different story : <PARA> one common element to nearly all repostings of this image is that the viewer is instructed to search for the man hiding under the bed : <PARA> the stories that are most commonly circulated in tandem with this photograph are almost certainly false , given that no one has turned up any official report or news story linking this image to a real - life divorce and / or murder , the narratives attached to the image have changed several times over , and the scenario pictured here ( i . e ., a young girl in a twin bed ) is not one that generally corresponds to a depiction of a married woman . <PARA> most likely this is just an innocent photograph of teenage girl which someone has digitally manipulated to add a peering face , or perhaps a picture of a girl who was being pranked by some friends , with one of those “ friends ” having a camera at the ready to record the moments just before and after a hidden lurker popped up to scare the daylights out of her . we haven ’ t been able to verify if yet , but a facebook poster who asserts she is related to the girl in the picture has stated that the photograph was indeed a prank :	
false	examples : [ collected via e - mail , january 2015 ] <PARA> noah pozner . there is a photo , in a series of related photos showing him in the same clothing , posted on his “ official facebook page .” it is definitely the same child shown over and over again in other photos on the page . <PARA> the same exact photo appears in multiple sources related to the peshawar , pakistan school massacre , allegedly depicting a victim of the massacre . it is unmistakably , undeniably the same exact photo . <PARA> origins : on 16 december 2014 , 145 people were killed in an ambush attack on army public school in peshawar , pakistan . among the victims were 132 children ranging in age from eight to eighteen , and the tragedy was reported upon widely across the world . <PARA> in late december 2014 , a curious photograph ostensibly snapped after the peshawar massacre began to circulate . in the picture ( captioned , above ), <PARA> a woman standing vigil for the victims of the 2014 attack appeared to be holding an image of a small , smiling boy . the image was instantly recognizable to many as the well known face of noah pozner , 6 , a victim of the december 2012 sandy hook elementary school shooting in newtown , connecticut . <PARA> twenty children and six teachers were killed at sandy hook elementary in december 2012 during the course of an event that ( like the tragedy in peshawar ) deeply upset people across the world . in the aftermath of the 2012 massacre , several conspiracy theories emerged either claiming the murders did not occur in the way they were reported , or the event was wholly fabricated as a “ false flag ” attack . initially the conspiracies orbited a larger concern that strict gun control laws would be introduced , spurred by the widespread grief that ensued from sandy hook . even when the predictions of a gun grab did not come to pass , the conspiracy theories inspired by the fear of it failed to abate . <PARA> when the above - displayed image began to circulate , many of what have come to be known as “ sandy hook truthers ” believed it was further evidence a nefarious conspiracy of unexplained origins was at work . why else would a woman in pakistan be displaying a picture of noah pozner at a vigil for slain pakistani students who were killed two years after he was ? <PARA> one particularly callous iteration of the claim approached the quandary as if individuals with eyes and the ability to process visual information could not see for themselves the identical picture was used by the woman in pakistan : <PARA> pakistan taliban boy is identical to facebook noah pozner — same slightly tilted head , same smile , same jacket collar , and identical button hole ! ( see yellow arrows ) <PARA> noah ’ s father , lenny pozner , has been harassing and bullying bloggers and youtubers , leading youtube to repeatedly take down videos about the sandy hook hoax because lenny claims “ copyright violation .” <PARA> lenny is also one of the 10 plaintiffs in a negligence and wrongful death lawsuit against the manufacturer , distributor and seller of the bushmaster ar - 15 rifle that lanza allegedly used in the sandy hook school shooting . <PARA> i hope the defendants ask lenny pozner how his son , noah , managed the impossible feat of being killed twice — the first time on dec . 14 , 2012 in newtown connecticut ; the second time two years two days later on dec . 16 , 2014 , halfway across the world in peshawar , pakistan . [ sarc ] <PARA> noah ’ s father , lenny pozner , has been harassing and bullying bloggers and youtubers , leading youtube to repeatedly take down videos about the sandy hook hoax because lenny claims “ copyright violation .” <PARA> lenny is also one of the 10 plaintiffs in a negligence and wrongful death lawsuit against the manufacturer , distributor and seller of the bushmaster ar - 15 rifle that lanza allegedly used in the sandy hook school shooting . <PARA> i hope the defendants ask lenny pozner how his son , noah , managed the impossible feat of being killed twice — the first time on dec . 14 , 2012 in newtown connecticut ; the second time two years two days later on dec . 16 , 2014 , halfway across the world in peshawar , pakistan . [ sarc ] <PARA> another recitation of the claim examined whether conspiracy adherents were being taunted via the use of pozner ’ s image : <PARA> can the photo ’ s misuse simply be brushed off as another bumbling google image search mistake ? is it be willful subterfuge aimed at poking fun at those who question the validity of the sandy hook event ? <PARA> a number of explanations might apply to this puzzling photograph . the first is that an image of pozner was mistakenly included in the vigil by someone who turned up his picture while performing an online search using a term such as “ december school massacre ” to find photos of those killed in peshawar and and did not recognize his face ( because he had dark hair and facial features not unlike those of many of the victims in peshawar ). another is that his image was deliberately included by mourners as an homage in order to publicly link multiple incidents of young , innocent victims ’ losing their lives in senseless school shootings . a third is that a massive worldwide cabal colluded to perpetrate or falsify the murders of more than 150 students and teachers collectively spanning the globe from connecticut to pakistan , and the puppeteers of this conspiracy were so inept that they failed the basic task of obtaining novel images to assign to each of the victims of the violent acts . <PARA> in fact , the second explanation offered above appears to be what happened : on the day of the peshawar incident a pakistani woman created a collage of photographs of young people killed in school shootings and posted it to facebook with the caption “ they went to school and never came back .” because the peshawar shooting occurred very close to the anniversary of the sandy hook massacre , she included a picture of a child from the latter event , namely noah pozner , along with pictures of peshawar victims : <PARA> that collage was then printed out and cut up into the individual photographs displayed by mourners at a vigil for the peshawar victims ( as evidenced by the thick black borders underneath some of the victims ’ pictures , such as noah ’ s , showing where the original collage had been captioned ):	
false	several of the entries in this section are legends about the implementation of simple yet brilliant innovations that increase the profits of successful companies many times over — everything from the mostly true ( alka - seltzer ‘ s ad campaigns featuring the use of two tablets instead of one ) to the completely apocryphal ( an outsider ’ s selling coca - cola the idea that they should bottle their product ). <PARA> another prominent entry in this genre of marketing legends is the claim that instant cake mixes which required only the addition of water initially sold quite poorly because housewives felt “ guilty ” about contributing virtually nothing to the cake - making process — a stumbling block that was successfully overcome when one food company hit on the ingenious idea of eliminating dried eggs from its mix and instead requiring the addition of a fresh egg , thus assuaging homemakers ’ guilt by providing them with a greater sense of participatory investment in the results : <PARA> although there ’ s a grain of truth to this claim , the legend that sprouted from it is a different kind of fruit : a marketing innovation did revive flagging sales of cake mixes , but it wasn ’ t the innovation most people think it was . <PARA> first of all , the choice between offering “ complete ” cake mixes ( i . e ., mixes that included dried eggs , to which consumers added only water ) or mixes that required the addition of fresh eggs was not an issue considered by food companies only when initial sales of instant cake mixes proved disappointing ; it was a point of contention from the very beginning : <PARA> it ’ s also not the case that initial sales of cake mixes were disappointing : between 1947 ( just before the major food companies introduced their cake mix products to the market ) and 1953 , sales of cake mixes doubled . the problem occurred several years later , when sales of cake mixes flattened between 1956 and 1960 ( rising only 5 percent during that period ). it was then that the major food companies sought to find out why more families weren ’ t using cake mixes and brought about the circumstances that gave rise to the “ egg theory ”: <PARA> however , as laura shapiro observed in something from the oven : reinventing dinner in 1950s america , “ while dichter ’ s work was influential , its precise role in the success of the cake mix is unclear .” for starters , although it may not have been a point articulated by the homemakers dichter surveyed , the fact was that fresh eggs produced superior cakes . using complete mixes which included dried eggs resulted in cakes that stuck to the pan , had poor texture , had a shorter shelf life , and often tasted too strongly of eggs . “ chances are ,” shapiro wrote , “ if adding eggs persuaded some women to overcome their aversion to cake mixes , it was at least partly because fresh eggs made for better cakes .” furthermore , the two food companies who came to dominate the cake mix market in this era , general mills and pillsbury , adopted opposite approaches : the former chose to go with fresh - egg mixes , while pillsbury opted to offer complete mixes . if the form of eggs used were truly the tipping point that saved the cake mix industry , then sales of one of these company ’ s products should have tanked in comparison to the other ’ s . <PARA> the key marketing innovation that dichter ’ s analysis spurred was not the fresh - egg cake mix , but rather the repositioning of cakes as merely one element of a larger product , an overall creation that entailed a much greater degree of participation and creativity from homemakers and emphasized appearance over taste : <PARA> what ultimately ensured the long - term success of instant cake mixes was a declining exposure to the art of cooking . from the 1950 ’ s onward , middle class girls tended to spend more time engaged in other pursuits outside the kitchen ( especially after the advent of television ), many home economics courses offered at schools started teaching students to bake with mixes rather than from scratch , and culinary knowledge and skills acquired by mothers and grandmothers stopped being passed along to successive generations . as fewer and fewer home cooks learned to recognize the difference between from - scratch cakes and mix cakes , the longevity of the latter was assured .

true	social media sites like facebook have hastened the circulation of warnings about the safety of animals . such is the case with a common caution to “ bang on the hood ” of a car or honk in the winter to alert cats who may have taken shelter atop tires or in other concealed places . according to the warnings , many cats who spend all or some of their time outside are killed or injured critically every year after having fallen asleep in or around the cars of unsuspecting motorists , particularly in colder weather . <PARA> the advice is so common that former star trek actor and social media influencer george takei referenced it in a post ( which included a fake photograph ) to his facebook page on 19 september 2014 : <PARA> this advice is commonly given , but are outdoor and indoor / outdoor cats truly at risk of injury in this fashion , particularly in colder months ? pet experts confirm that cats ( and dogs ) have been known to seek shelter in the confines of cars and trucks and that such hiding spots may not always be readily spotted by drivers who themselves may be hurrying to avoid the cold by starting the engine . for example , dane county humane society spokesperson gayle viney told the capital times that recently - driven cars are particularly attractive to chilly cats : <PARA> webmd also offered the following advice to drivers who are concerned about cats seeking shelter in or around their vehicles : <PARA> as to the frequency of cats being injured after getting stuck or hiding in car wheel wells or engines , palo alto animal services acting superintendent connie urbanski said the scenario is not uncommon . however , urbanski also noted that the feline behavior was not exclusive to cold weather months : <PARA> ultimately , cats can and do seek shelter in and around vehicles for warmth and some are injured or even killed when drivers fail to notice their presence . banging on the hood or honking the horn can wake a sleeping cat and prevent this from occurring , but sheltering cats indoors is the best way to keep them safe from vehicle dangers .	
true	origins : shortly after filmmaker michael moore generated considerable social media controversy by tweeting about snipers being ‘ cowards ’ in january 2015 , a story started circulating on the internet about a death threat clint eastwood had supposedly issued to moore during the national board of review awards ceremony in 2005 : <PARA> at the national board review dinner in 2005 , moore and eastwood were both present , being honored on behalf of their films , “ bowling for columbine ,” and “ million dollar baby .” <PARA> clint eastwood accepted his award , and said the following , “ michael moore and i actually have a lot in common we both appreciate living in a country where there ’ s free expression .” <PARA> then came the ... joke . <PARA> “ but , michael , if you ever show up at my front door with a camera , i ’ ll kill you .” <PARA> the audience laughed , moore laughed , then eastwood said , “ i mean it ...” <PARA> clint eastwood accepted his award , and said the following , “ michael moore and i actually have a lot in common we both appreciate living in a country where there ’ s free expression .” <PARA> then came the ... joke . <PARA> “ but , michael , if you ever show up at my front door with a camera , i ’ ll kill you .” <PARA> the audience laughed , moore laughed , then eastwood said , “ i mean it ...” <PARA> while the story does include some error in detail ( michael moore was at the ceremony to receive an award for fahrenheit 911 , not bowling for columbine ), clint eastwood really did make comments similar to the ones referenced above at that event . <PARA> video of clint eastwood ’ s acceptance speech is not readily available online ; but a 2005 new york daily news article confirms that the dirty harry actor did indeed make the threat , although it is doubtful eastwood was serious about ending michael moore ’ s life . <PARA> a spokesman for the bowling for columbine director said moore found eastwood ’ s speech amusing at the time : <PARA> “ michael laughed along with everyone else , and took mr . eastwood ’ s comments in the lighthearted spirit in which they were given .” <PARA> michael moore may have laughed when clint eastwood delivered his “ threat ” in 2005 , but moore told a different story when he revisited the incident for a daily beast article in 2012 . moore , who was responding to clint eastwood ’ s memorable “ invisible chair ” speech at the republican national convention that year , wrote that he was unnerved by clint eastwood ’ s death threat in 2005 : <PARA> a few years ago , at the annual national board of review film awards held at tavern on the green in new york , i was there to hand out one of the honors . when it came time for eastwood to accept his , he went up to the microphone and growled to me in front of the audience , “ if you ever show up at my house with that camera , i ’ ll shoot you on sight .” the audience laughed , i laughed , but the person who issued the threat wasn ’ t laughing . that creeped me out a bit . i made sure never to go stand on clint eastwood ’ s lawn .	
unproven	one of the many oddball terms that has crept into the english language in the past century is a peculiarly inexplicable one : the verbal shortform of ’ 86 ’ to mean ‘ to dismiss or quash ,’ ‘ to bar entry or further service to ,’ and even ‘ to kill .’ while its uses have come to be widespread ( one can say that the bank 86 ’ d your scheme to have it underwrite the start - up costs of your business venture , or that a friend who made a spectacle of himself in a bar was 86 ’ d from the place , or that a mob boss had a particularly troublesome competitor 86 ’ d ), the origin of this now omnibus term remains obscure : <PARA> according to the oxford english dictionary , the first verifiable use of 86 in the ‘ refuse service to ’ sense dates to a 1944 book about john barrymore , a movie star of the 1920s famous for his acting and infamous for his drinking : “ there was a bar in the belasco building ... but barrymore was known in that cubby as an ‘ eighty - six ’. an ‘ eighty - six ’, in the patois of western dispensers , means : ‘ don ’ t serve him .'” <PARA> the most widely accepted theory of the term ’ s origin states it derives from a code supposedly used in some restaurants in the 1930s , wherein 86 was a shortform among restaurant workers for ‘ we ’ re all out of it .’ snippets of said code were published in newsman walter winchell ’ s column in 1933 , where it was presented as part of a “ glossary of soda - fountain lingo .” <PARA> the meaning of 86 advanced by the restaurant code hypothesis presents it as an announcement that an eatery has run out of a particular item , whereas the usage people are familiar with positions 86 as a command that something or someone be gotten rid of . could a term meant to communicate “ we ’ re out of strawberry ice cream , so tell people who try to order it that they ’ ll have to choose something else ” morph into “ we no longer want that person on our property ; show him the door ” or “ dump that batch of vaccine ; something ’ s wrong with it ”? more simply , how does “ we don ’ t have any ” become “ get rid of what we have ”? <PARA> the 86 of the restaurant code of the 1930s ( which could have slipped into the papers as a leg - pull perpetrated on an unwary journalist ) never seemed to be reflected in anything other than newspaper articles touting the code itself . given that slang common to its times seems to effortlessly work its ways into all sorts of popular culture outlets ( novels , radio shows , plays , movies ), that 86 apparently took until 1944 to appear in as much as even one book tends to argue against its being in common parlance at the time the restaurant code was supposedly all the rage . also , when it did appear , it had nothing to do with “ we ’ re all out of that item ,” the supposed original meaning , but instead was a presentation of “ deny that fellow service ,” one popular form of its clear - cut current meaning . <PARA> another theory posits that chumley ’ s bar ( at 86 bedford street in new york ) was the inspiration for the term . unruly patrons thrown out of that establishment were said to land in the street from whence they would have a clear view of the 86 over the door , leading to their ruefully concluding they ’ d been 86ed . one problem with that supposition is why , if that were so , they didn ’ t consider themselves ‘ chumley ’ d ’. <PARA> other conjectures suggest that specific restaurants or watering holes were legally barred from hosting more than 85 patrons on their premises at any one time , thus the 86th person to attempt to gain entry would be denied service . or that a particular legal code ( such as one governing liquor laws ) contained an article 86 that had something to do with refusing service or otherwise saying no to someone . those theories are shaky at best , in that no evidence in support of either has yet surfaced . <PARA> far more outlandish explanations have also been offered . one posits that cowboys already well into their cups would be surreptitiously served 86 proof whiskey rather than a frontier bar ’ s usual 100 proof in hopes of keeping them from getting too rowdy and kicking the bar apart . that etymology fails on a few points . first , term ’ s meanings of refusing service or announcing the shortage of a particular item is far removed from the act being described , which is continuing to serve customers management has reason to view as problems . second , a cowboy drunk on 86 proof whiskey would present just as much of a problem to a saloon ’ s wellbeing as would one wasted on 100 proof hooch , thus there would be little benefit in terms of keeping the peace to substituting less potent booze for stronger firewater . last , the term ’ 86 ’ has never carried the meaning of “ to cheat a consumer by secretly substituting inferior goods for what has been bargained for .” <PARA> some think to attempt to tie the origin of the term to article 86 of the uniform code of military justice , <PARA> the awol ( absent without leave ) section of that code that makes it a crime for one serving in the military to fail to go to his appointed place of duty at the time prescribed , to leave his place of duty , or to be absent from his unit without authority . were that the term ’ s origin , one would expect its first surfacings to have occurred in the military . also , you never hear of someone ’ s having gone 86 ; you instead hear “ he went awol .” <PARA> similarly , the american national standards institute ’ s ( ansi ) list of standard device numbers gets looked to by some because its item # 86 is the lockout relay , a mechanism used to shut down an electrical system when things go haywire . while at least one of the core concepts of the linguistic term 86 ( refusing service ) is similar enough to the purpose of these devices ( shutting something down ), the list of standard device numbers does not date to the 1930s . <PARA> then there are those who look to the abortion drug ru - 486 for the term ’ s origin , translating the name as “ are you for 86 ( murder )?” the compound was discovered in 1980 , which rules it out as the origin of a linguistic term first noted in the 1930s , its “ ru ” coming from roussel uclaf , the french pharmaceutical company that developed the abortifacient . <PARA> restaurant code and all other theories so far mentioned aside , one hypothesis as to the term ’ s origin appears to hold water , at least in so far as no part of it seems to run counter to any other part . by its lights , 86 is rhyming slang for nix , a word meaning ‘ to forbid , refuse , veto ’ ( as in “ the boss nixed my great plan for reorganizing the company ”). nix carries a clear meaning of ‘ say no to , turn down , forbid ,’ which is the primary meaning ascribed to 86 . yet unlike other theories about how 86 entered the language , neither are there supposed earlier forms conveying a different meaning ( e . g ., the restaurant code ), alternative forms the terms could more reasonably have taken ( chumley ’ d ), nor documentary evidence supporting the posit ’ s claim ( liquor codes that included an article 86 having something to do with barring service to a potential customer ). nix therefore appears the more likely of all the conjectures .

true	although the custom is sometimes more honored in the breach than in the observance , the u . s . flag code states that : <PARA> given how finely - attuned candidates for high office usually are to the importance of symbolism , illinois senator ( and democratic presidential hopeful ) barack obama caused something of a stir in september 2007 when he was seemingly spotted not observing the hand - over - heart protocol during a playing of “ the star - spangled banner ” at an indianola , iowa , steak fry attended by the six top democratic presidential candidates : <PARA> the photograph itself is real , one of several images of the iowa steak fry event published by time , and shows then - senator barack obama standing with his hands clasped just below his waist , while new mexico governor bill richardson , new york senator hillary clinton , and ruth harkin ( wife of iowa senator tom harkin ) stand with their hands held over their hearts . it ’ s difficult to establish context from a single still image , but other accounts ( including abc news video of the event ) documented that the picture was as described : <PARA> ( it ’ s not clear from the photograph or the video just what the candidates were looking at . the flag code advises that they should be “ standing at attention facing the flag ,” but none of them is facing the flag displayed behind the platform on which they ’ re standing . presumably another flag was in place off to the right of the platform , since most of the candidates were facing that direction .) <PARA> as we noted earlier , although the u . s . flag code still specifies that those present should stand “ with the right hand over the heart ” during the playing of the u . s . national anthem , that particular form is one that has generally come to be observed less and less consistently among the general public over the decades : <PARA> as for whether this incident was an “ accident ,” whether senator obama habitually declines to perform the hand - over - heart gesture , or whether there ’ s any particular meaning to the ( non -) action , an obama campaign spokesperson responded : “ sometimes he does , sometimes he doesn ’ t . in no way was he making any sort of statement , and any suggestion to the contrary is ridiculous .” the senator himself said that “ my grandfather taught me when i was two . during the pledge of allegiance , you put your hand over your heart . during the national anthem , you sing .” <PARA> when television ’ s inside edition ran a segment on this issue , they included some images ( supplied by the obama campaign ) of the senator standing with his hand over his heart during other playings of the national anthem : <PARA> a spoof article about barack obama ’ s stance on the u . s . national anthem was later circulated via e - mail as a genuine statement from the senator .

false	origins : when dozens of mourners at a funeral in tete , mozambique , passed away after drinking a contaminated batch of phombe in january 2015 , speculation arose that the local homemade beer had been spiked with poisonous crocodile bile : <PARA> the beer , known as “ phombe ”, is traditionally served at functions in mozambique ’ s tete province . deaths from drinking it are rare , correspondents say . <PARA> carle mosse , the province ’ s health director , said it was suspected that the poisoning had been caused by crocodile bile although this had yet to be confirmed in tests . <PARA> it was not immediately clear how the beer had been contaminated and whether it was intentional . <PARA> the woman who brewed the beer and several members of her family were among the victims , radio mozambique has reported . <PARA> carle mosse , the province ’ s health director , said it was suspected that the poisoning had been caused by crocodile bile although this had yet to be confirmed in tests . <PARA> it was not immediately clear how the beer had been contaminated and whether it was intentional . <PARA> the woman who brewed the beer and several members of her family were among the victims , radio mozambique has reported . <PARA> stories about the supposedly poisonous powers of crocodile bile have been circulating for decades . according to professor n . z . nyazema of the department of clinical pharmacology at the university of zimbabwe , witches in the 1800s were accused of using bile from the gall bladders of crocodiles to make a poison known as nduru . nyazema penned an article titled “ crocodile bile , a poison : myth or reality ?” for central african journal of medicine in 1984 explaining how the poison may have been used : <PARA> it is widely believed that the bile from the gall bladder of a crocodile is very poisonous . the bile nduru is used as poison which is added to beer or stiff porridge , sadza , of an unsuspecting victim . it is not easy to buy this poison neither is it easy for anyone to kill a crocodile solely for the purpose of obtaining the bile . but with a good fee one can obtain some of the poison from a special nanga [ a traditional healer of the zimbabwean shona tribe ]. at times the nanga may undertake to poison the victim thus adding mystery to the ingredients of the poison . it is reported that the poisoning occurs at special occasions like beer drinking : the nduru is said to be introduced into the beer by dipping the finger or nail where a small amount is placed : this will suffice for the purpose . the unfortunate victim is supposed to die within 24 hours . the poison is supposed to manifest itself when the patient develops pains mainly in the abdomen . <PARA> while professor nyazema ’ s account mirrors the events that transpired in mozambique in january 2015 ( with the notable exception the above - quoted article references the poisoning of a single person while the events in mozambique would have <PARA> required enough poison for close to one hundred people ), the lethal powers of crocodile bile have yet to be proved . in fact , after learning about nduru , nyazema conducted his own tests to determine the toxicity of crocodile bile : using ten crocodile gall bladders , twenty mice , and a baboon , the professor determined the bile of a crocodile was not particularly lethal . <PARA> hans dieter neuwinger came to a similar conclusion in his book african ethnobotany : poisons and drugs : chemistry , pharmacology , toxicology , writing that crocodile bile was “ virtually non - poisonous .” additionally , a study presented at the world crocodile conference in 2013 concluded freeze - dried crocodile bile was safe for human consumption : <PARA> for high efficacy of crocodile bile product , acute effects of freeze - dried crocodile bile were performed on male sprague dawley rats . the result showed that morbidity and mortality have not found any in treatment 300 mg / kg group of rats . because of recommendation dose in human is 25 mg / 60kg / day , there is very less than in the rat treatment . these revealed that freeze dried crocodile bile is appropriate for product development to be supplementary food in the future . <PARA> furthermore , christian lindmeier , a spokesman for the world health organization , said it is not uncommon for locals to add bile to poor quality beer : <PARA> the use of bile is not uncommon in the production of local or poor quality beer but is not known to be toxic to the extent this outbreak shows . <PARA> if crocodile bile really is as harmless as professor nyazema , researcher hans dieter neuwinger , and who spokesman christian lindmeier make it out to be , then where did this fear begin ? forbes science writer david kroll noted on 12 january 2015 while crocodile bile was the main ingredient in the poison nduru , it was likely mixed with other toxic plants : <PARA> traditional descriptions of this poison might be consistent with a toxic plant that may have been added to the brew in witchcraft practices . <PARA> crocodile bile , like bat whiskers , the hair of a black cat , a pinch of gargoyle sweat , eye of newt , and troll teeth , does not appear to be deadly on its own .

true	origins : an obscure quote attributed to british statesman winston churchill has been circulating on the internet since at least may 2013 , when missouri state representative rick stream sent an e - mail to his colleagues warning about the dangers of islam . that e - mail cited a passage said to have been taken from a speech by churchill , as reproduced in his 1899 book the river war : an historical account of the reconquest of the soudan : <PARA> i am sending the attached short speech from winston churchill , delivered by him in 1899 when he was a young soldier and <PARA> journalist . it probably sets out the current views of many but expressed in the wonderful churchillian turn of phrase and use of the english language , of which he was a past master . sir winston churchill was , without doubt , one of the greatest men of the late 19th and 20th centuries . <PARA> he was a brave young soldier , a brilliant journalist , an extraordinary politician and statesman , a great war leader and prime minister , to whom the western world must be forever in his debt . he was a prophet in his own time ; he died on 24 january 1965 , at the grand old age of 90 and , after a lifetime of service to his country , was accorded a state funeral . <PARA> <PARA> how dreadful are the curses which mohammedanism lays on its votaries !

unproven	senior mit scientist warns 1 in 2 children will have autism by 2025 <PARA> the overuse of monsanto ’ s roundup herbicide on our food is causing glyphosate toxicity and it is now being considered as the single most important factor in development of autism and other chronic disease . at a recent panel discussion about gmos , a senior scientist has stated that one in two children will be autistic by 2025 ... <PARA> origins : on 23 december 2014 , the website alliance for natural health published an article titled “ half of all children will be autistic by 2025 , warns senior research scientist at mit .” it described a dire <PARA> prognostication made “ at a conference ” in early december by stephanie seneff , phd ( whose web biography described her as a “ senior research scientist at the mit computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory ,” not an individual specializing in epidemiology .) the precise location , date , and general scope of the december 2014 conference in question was not disclosed in the article , but a reference was made to the general subject of genetically modified organisms ( gmos ). <PARA> the headline ’ s reference to looming autism diagnosis spikes was continued in the article ’ s first line : “ evidence points to glyphosate toxicity from the overuse of monsanto ’ s roundup herbicide .” after describing seneff ’ s background in computer science , the article continued : <PARA> at a conference last thursday , in a special panel discussion about gmos , she took the audience by surprise when she declared , “ at today ’ s rate , by 2025 , one in two children will be autistic .” she noted that the side effects of autism closely mimic those of glyphosate toxicity , and presented data showing a remarkably consistent correlation between the use of roundup on crops ( and the creation of roundup - ready gmo crop seeds ) with rising rates of autism . children with autism have biomarkers indicative of excessive glyphosate , including zinc and iron deficiency , low serum sulfate , seizures , and mitochondrial disorder . <PARA> the article conflated a number of unrelated claims and beliefs about autism and its causes , jumping from pesticides to vaccines and back again in the course of its travels . a usda report issued in december 2014 about acceptable levels of pesticides ( that made no mention at all of autism ) was among the cited material : <PARA> in addition , as we have previously reported , the number of adverse reactions from vaccines can be correlated as well with autism , though seneff says it doesn ’ t correlate quite as closely as with roundup . the same correlations between applications of glyphosate and autism show up in deaths from senility . <PARA> of course , autism is a complex problem with many potential causes . dr . seneff ’ s data , however , is particularly important considering how close the correlation is — and because it is coming from a scientist with impeccable credentials . earlier this year , she spoke at the autism one conference and presented many of the same facts ; that presentation is available on youtube . <PARA> of course , autism is a complex problem with many potential causes . dr . seneff ’ s data , however , is particularly important considering how close the correlation is — and because it is coming from a scientist with impeccable credentials . earlier this year , she spoke at the autism one conference and presented many of the same facts ; that presentation is available on youtube . <PARA> both the article and seneff ’ s biography mention work with the group autismone , a group of parents ( not scientists ) who ’ ve espoused the fervent belief autism is caused not by genetic factors but environmental contaminants . an about us page on the autismone web site explains : <PARA> autismone is a non - profit charity organization 501 ( c )( 3 ) started by a small group of parents of children with autism . parents are and must remain the driving force of our community , the stakes are too high and the issues too sacred to delegate to outside interests . autism is a preventable / treatable biomedical condition . autism is the result of environmental triggers . autism is not caused by “ bad ” genes and the epidemic is not the result of “ better ” diagnosis . children with autism suffer from gut bugs , allergies , heavy metal toxicity , mitochondrial disorders , antioxidant deficiencies , nutritional deficiencies and autoimmune diseases — all of which are treatable . <PARA> both seneff and autismone appear to reject the accepted findings of science on the heretofore not fully understood causes of autism , namely in terms of genetics . the claim also deviates from mainstream science on whether autism is truly more prevalent or whether diagnostic criteria and awareness have caused the increase in the number of children diagnosed with the disorder each year . the centers for disease control ( cdc ) explained in a march 2014 autism surveillance summary it was difficult to rule out improved diagnostics as a factor in a perceived increase in autism across populations of children : <PARA> the global prevalence of autism has increased twentyfold to thirtyfold since the earliest epidemiologic studies were conducted in the late 1960s and early 1970s . at that time , prevalence estimates from european studies were one in 2 , 500 children in the population , and by the 2000s prevalence estimates from large surveys were 1 %- 2 % of all children . although the underlying reasons for the apparent prevalence changes are difficult to study empirically , select studies suggest that much of the recent prevalence increase is likely attributable to extrinsic factors such as improved awareness and recognition and changes in diagnostic practice or service availability . <PARA> the article stated that seneff made very specific claims at the december 2014 conference : that half of all children will be diagnosed with autism by 2025 , and the perceived increase in the prevalence of autism is due to the use of glyphosate ( an herbicide sold by monsanto under the brand name roundup ) on crops . from <PARA> the information in the article , it appeared seneff ’ s claims rested on somewhat shaky foundations . <PARA> regarding autism rates in 2025 , the “ 50 percent of children ” estimate looks to be a rudimentary extrapolation of an apparent uptick in autism diagnoses in recent years . particularly if the cause of such an uptick is improvements in screening and access to diagnostics , it ’ s just as likely the rate would plateau or even dip in the near future when considered by itself . no explanation was proffered ( in the article , at least ) to justify an affirmative belief the prevalence of autism would rise so drastically ( and by that logic we might assume that by 2050 , 125 percent of the population will be diagnosed with autism ). <PARA> even disregarding the sloppy mathematics , the claim ’ s very basis ( that glyphosate is the cause of a perceived increase in autism ) is unsupported . no mention was made of how glyphosate was isolated and shown to be a cause ( or even a factor ) in some or any cases of autism in the article . no autism spikes near agricultural facilities were described , nor was any definitive causative link at all cited by the article ( and presumably , seneff ) to back up the purported link between glyphosate and autism rates anywhere other than the imaginations of those making the claim . the single link of merit made within the article ( to a usda report ) made absolutely no mention of autism at all but was misleadingly arranged to suggest a connection . <PARA> what the claim seemed to hinge on largely was a correlation / causation fallacy : because [ unclear activity involving glyphosate ] occurred , a corresponding rise in autism diagnoses must be due to that unspecified issue with glyphosate . claims of a similar nature have been dispelled with graphs like the following that show how difficult ( or simple ) it is to “ prove ” any one cause correlates with any one effect : <PARA> clearly the graph is tongue - in - cheek , but the sentiment is clear . without peer - reviewed reproducible research , any number of factors can be blamed for what looks like a rise in autism rates . in actuality , scientists in a number of relevant fields have been working full - time to find real and provable answers to that question . <PARA> whether educated or not , guesswork is only the start of research in epidemiology , and no published research exists to prove ( or even suggest ) a link between glyphosate and autism . no evidence was presented in the article to provide context for why glyphosate ( or gmos ) would be any more likely to account for the presumed increase than other environmental factors , and it appeared the only visible connection between the two was their inclusion on a graph presented at a conference of an indeterminate nature .

unproven	we first received an admonition not to combine motrin with robitussin via email in december 2008 : <PARA> the story the warning is framed upon , that an eight - year - old girl named madison died from a heart attack and strokes brought about by this combination of over - the - counter drugs , was unverifiable : the account provided no information as to madison ’ s surname , where she lived , who her doctors were , where she was treated , or even the date she died . absent any of that information , trying to determine if there actually was such a child proved a nearly impossible task . <PARA> it is possible that a child can have a heart attack . for example , a news report of 2 october 2007 noted heart attacks in children are a rare but under - recognized problem that are most likely caused by heart spasms which briefly cut off the blood supply . it therefore cannot be ruled out that a child called madison ( of no known last name or address ) did experience an acute myocardial infarction . however , that in rare instances children have experienced heart attacks only proves that such events happen , not that any particular drug interaction causes them . <PARA> the active ingredient in children ’ s motrin is ibuprofen , a nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drug effective in relieving pain and reducing inflammation . ( ibuprofen is also marketed under several other brand names , such as advil , medipren , and nuprin .) children ’ s motrin suspension first became available as a prescription product in 1989 , and in 1995 it was cleared by the food and drug administration for marketing as an over - the - counter product . both those landmarks occurred only after the product had been extensively tested on children : <PARA> robitussin pediatric cough is a syrup that contains dextromethorphan hbr , a cough suppressant . its pediatric cough & cold formulation contains chlorpheniramine maleate , an antihistamine , in addition to the dextromethorphan hbr . <PARA> we have not yet turned up any studies confirming heart attacks brought about by the combination of these two over - the - counter medications , either in children or adults , but that is not to say children should be taking otc cold medications . an 8 october 2008 statement by the fda supports the recommendation of the consumer healthcare products association that children under the age of four should not be dosed with over - the - counter cough and cold products . this follows its january 2008 advisory that these products not be used in children under the age of 2 because of the risk of serious and potentially life - threatening side effects . <PARA> as noted in a news report from september 2007 : “ an fda review of side - effect records filed with the agency between 1969 and september 2006 found 54 reports of deaths in children associated with decongestant medicines made with pseudoephedrine , phenylephrine or ephedrine . it also found 69 reports of deaths associated with antihistamine medicines containing diphenhydramine , brompheniramine or chlorpheniramine . most of the deaths were children younger than 2 .” <PARA> the fda offers these medication tips to the parents and caregivers of small children : <PARA> in 2003 , another personal account circulated by e - mail implicated children ’ s motrin in the formation of stomach ulcers in a child dosed with it . we did not encounter any subsequent reports of similar instances , and no specific interaction precaution guidance exists for that drug combination . <PARA> on 22 december 2014 , children ’ s medical center of dallas addressed the recirculating rumor on twitter :	
unproven	origins : in 2013 , a report started circulating on the internet which claimed the snack food pringles was causing cancer . while the report , frequently titled “ cancer in a can : the shocking true story of how pringles are made ,” used facts from a 2007 scientific study , much of the information presented was misleading . <PARA> the primary claim put forth in the “ cancer in a can ” article was the chemical acrylamide , which is found in pringles brand potato chips , causes cancer . this claim , however , is not entirely true . <PARA> the heatox project , a three - year study about the risk of acrylamide , found the chemical “ might be a cancer risk factor ” for humans . rodents who were exposed to the carcinogen developed several different types of cancer , but research on how it affects humans is incomplete . <PARA> the national cancer institute stated the level of acrylamide in foods is a “ major concern ,” but also noted researchers do not know for certain if the chemical causes cancer in humans : <PARA> scientists do not yet know with any certainty whether the levels of acrylamide typically found in some foods pose a health risk for humans ... <PARA> studies in rodent models have found that acrylamide exposure poses a risk for several types of cancer . however , the evidence from human studies is still incomplete . the national toxicology program and the international agency for research on cancer consider acrylamide to be a “ probable human carcinogen ,” based on studies in laboratory animals given acrylamide in drinking water . however , toxicology studies have shown differences in acrylamide absorption rates between humans and rodents . <PARA> studies in rodent models have found that acrylamide exposure poses a risk for several types of cancer . however , the evidence from human studies is still incomplete . the national toxicology program and the international agency for research on cancer consider acrylamide to be a “ probable human carcinogen ,” based on studies in laboratory animals given acrylamide in drinking water . however , toxicology studies have shown differences in acrylamide absorption rates between humans and rodents . <PARA> furthermore , pringles do not carry a higher risk than other foods containing acrylamide . according to the world health organization , acrylamide is naturally produced when certain foods ( e . g ., french fries , potato chips ) are heated at temperatures higher than 120 ° c ( 248 ° f ): <PARA> acrylamide ( c3h3onh2 ) is a chemical that is produced naturally in certain foods when they are cooked at high temperatures . it is also manufactured industrially for use in the production of polyacrylamide gels , which are used for various purposes , including the treatment of drinking - water and wastewater . acrylamide is known to cause cancer in animals and , in high doses , can cause nerve damage in humans . <PARA> it ’ s unclear how exactly pringles got tied into this rumor about acrylamide and cancer , but it may have something to do with an october 2011 article titled “ the shocking true story of how pringles are made ,” which had nothing to do with claims about pringles containing acrylamide ( or any other putative carcinogen ) but rather with the fact they have precious little actual potato in them : <PARA> instead of shaving bits off of a potato and deep frying them , the company starts with a slurry of rice , wheat , corn , and potato flakes and presses them into shape . so these potato chips aren ’ t really potato at all . the snack - dough is then rolled out like a sheet of ultra - thin cookie dough and cut into chip - cookies by a machine . the cut is complete enough that the chips are fully free of the extra dough , which is lifted away from the chips by a machine . <PARA> while some may not feel like eating pringles after reading the “ shocking truth ” of how they are made , the national cancer institute maintains there is no acrylamide - related reason to stop eating potato chips or french fries : <PARA> acrylamide levels in food vary widely depending on the manufacturer , the cooking time , and the method and temperature of the cooking process . the best advice at this time is to follow established dietary guidelines and eat a healthy , balanced diet that is low in fat and rich in high - fiber grains , fruits , and vegetables .	
true	on 8 december 2014 , a video was uploaded to youtube showing two hikers walking on a lake of ice so clear it appeared as if they were walking on air , with the uploader describing what it depicted as “ me and my friend walking on frozen mountain lake in high tatras mountains in slovakia ”: <PARA> that video racked up more than four million views in just a few short days . while most viewers were simply amazed at the beauty of the frozen lake in the tatras mountains shown in the video , others were skeptical about the authenticity of the scene . one persistent claim offered by skeptics as an argument against the video ’ s authenticity was that clear ice is too thin to hold the weight of two grown adults . this claim was refuted by accuweather in a post published on 13 december 2014 : <PARA> another factor frequently questioned by internet investigators was the actual ice itself : do such crystal clear waters exist ? slovakian igor ludma explained to the new york daily news a sudden drop in temperature amid a snowless stretch of weather could result in the conditions seen in the video above : <PARA> accuweather confirmed such weather conditions existed in slovakia at the time , writing lomnicky stit “ has been gripped by subfreezing temperatures since the middle of november .”

false	origins : on 26 november 2014 , the site medical kidnap published a harrowing article entitled “ breastfed , homebirthed babies taken away from parents for not using hospital .” in that article , bellingham , washington , parents erica may and cleave rengo claimed their state ’ s division of child protective services ( cps ) took custody of their three young <PARA> children ( newborn twins and a 10 - month - old boy named levi ) due to the couple ’ s decision to forgo a hospital birth . the article immediately prompted widespread outrage and was shared more than 100 , 000 times on facebook in its first day alone . <PARA> according to the article , erica gave birth to twins morna kai grace and daniel clemente on 2 october 2014 . under pressure from relatives and friends who did not fully agree with their home birth plan , the rengos “ notified ” emts of the babies ’ arrival “ sometime ” after they were born . ( it is not clear whether emts were summoned to the home , what the reason given for the notification was , or what transpired during the emts ’ visit .) according to the couple , they declined advice given by the paramedics suggesting they visit a hospital to follow up after the twins ’ arrival , and their refusal to go to the hospital prompted the emts to report them to cps . <PARA> the article stated that homebirth alone prompted emts to file a report with cps . while the decision to give birth at home is often considered risky , and the birth of twins is generally deemed “ high risk ” by obstetricians , there is no indication that a woman ’ s simply choosing a homebirth is a factor in cps involvement . given that home births are not uncommon , allegations such as those made by the rengos should be rife if delivering a baby at home was by itself considered an automatic red flag for abuse . <PARA> as well , a number of claims made in the upsetting account either conflict withed one another . for example , in one statement , rengo said the children were taken from her because she refused to treat eczema with steroids and opted for natural remedies , but in other portions of the article , she blamed home birth for the children ’ s removal ( despite the number of babies born this way each day without cps involvement ). <PARA> the claims of parents and families involved with child welfare agencies in any state are difficult to independtly verify because unlike criminal cases , family court proceedings are not public . cps and related agencies cannot confirm or deny claims about their actions because their cases generally involve minors and abuse allegations . however , on 3 december 2014 the bellingham herald provided additional details about the rengo case , including a statement from cps denying claims that home birth was the issue that had caused the children to be removed from their home : <PARA> due to confidentiality , we cannot discuss details , except to say that a court determined a child ’ s safety required removal from the home . <PARA> no policy of children ’ s administration would allow a child to be taken due to a home birth . a home birth is not in any way a child safety risk factor in the view of children ’ s administration . <PARA> no policy of children ’ s administration would allow a child to be taken due to a home birth . a home birth is not in any way a child safety risk factor in the view of children ’ s administration . <PARA> in a follow - up article published by the herald two days later reporting that a court commissioner had decided to allow ther children to be returned to their parents , cps and public officials once again affirmed thathome birth had nothing to do with the decision to take protective custody of the children ; the primary factors involved were the couple ’ s legal issues , mental health issues , and child health care issues : <PARA> saying he was giving a bellingham couple a “ second chance ,” a whatcom county superior court commissioner decided friday , dec . 5 , to return their three young children , who had been taken into protective custody amid the state ’ s concerns over a chaotic home life . <PARA> but commissioner thomas verge told cleave rengo , 23 , and erica carey , 29 , that the children would be removed again if they didn ’ t follow his conditions as well as cooperate with child protective services . <PARA> cps has said the case had nothing to do with home - birth . <PARA> assistant attorney general rob olson laid out a case that detailed the family ’ s numerous contacts with law enforcement since 2013 - 14 in whatcom county and seven when the couple lived elsewhere in washington state ;

false	origins : an age - old technique for mobilizing a populace to fight a war is to so thoroughly demonize the enemy that the conflict becomes seen by the public as a moral battle rather than a political one . this technique was used to maximum effect in america during world war i , when for the first time the u . s . was engaged as a late entrant in an overseas war , a war that many americans wanted no part of . accordingly , the germans were recast as “ huns ” to whom all sorts of atrocity tales were <PARA> attributed , and suddenly everything germanic became anathema . german - americans sought to avoid being branded as disloyalists , traitors , or spies by declaring themselves to be dutch or anglicizing their names , and common items with german names were retitled : sauerkraut became “ victory cabbage ,” hamburgers turned into “ liberty sandwiches ,” and “ hamburger steak ” was henceforth known as “ salisbury steak .” and a young comic named julius marx , who came from a german family and who was touring america in a vaudeville show with his three brothers , altered the persona of his stage character from german to yiddish and finally to american . julius would later became nationally famous as groucho , one of the celebrated marx brothers . <PARA> the renaming frenzy didn ’ t carry over to world war ii ( in large part because the nazis did such a thorough job of demonizing themselves ), but one result of the nazi era in germany was the long - lasting stigmatization of the names “ adolph ” and “ hitler .” thousands of people ( on both sides of the conflict ) bearing those names changed them in order to avoid any association with the notorious german dictator . so when marx brothers fans eventually learned that although harpo marx had always stated his first name as arthur , he had actually been born adolph marx , they naturally assumed he had changed his first name for a similar reason . in fact , this was a retroactive explanation for a transition that had actually taken place many years earlier . <PARA> although harpo was indeed born under the name of adolph marx , he had quickly been nicknamed “ ahdie ,” a name he much preferred to adolph — so much so that he eventually adopted the name arthur in place of his given name . when exactly adolph became arthur is difficult to pin down , but the change seems to have been effected by 1911 ; and newspaper reviews of marx brothers performances document that he was identified as “ arthur ” as early as 1913 . thus adolph marx ’ s name change demonstrably took place long before the world had heard of an austrian named adolf hitler , well before the outbreak of world war i , and even a few years before that momentous day when the comic was tagged with the moniker of “ harpo .”	
unproven	but in this case his voice was sufficiently good — a lovely rounded bass — to warrant the producer giving him a chance to prove he could cope . the role was that of the famous tax collector and , as a concession , the stage director allowed the singer to have a crib sheet positioned in the pit to remind him of his words . <PARA> on the opening night , the bass crooner paid more than the standard number of visits to the toilet facilities , but his voice was in good shape . on cue , he strolled confidently onstage and positioned himself in front of his idiot board . the band struck up his theme , and a deep , rich timbre filled the theatre . <PARA> sadly , hazards lie in wait for the unwary . the words of the song go , ‘ my stately pen is never lax / when i ’ m assessing income tax ’. unfortunately , the mischievous scamp who ’ d felt - tipped the words on to the card had neglected to leave a space between ‘ pen ’ and ‘ is ’, and the nervous artiste simply sang what he read , bringing a right royal flush to his cheeks — and raising a few eyebrows among the genteel ladies in the boxes . <PARA> origins : just <PARA> as english abounds with puns that play on the homophony of ‘ seamen ’ vs . ‘ semen ’, <PARA> numerous bits of humor turn on the slight difference in orthography between the very different concepts ‘ penis ’ and ‘ pen is .’ a favorite proofreading joke with many variations employs a punchline that has the familiar phrase “ the pen is mightier than the sword ” being rendered as “ the penis , mightier than the sword .” the piece featured here comes from a collection of urban legends but is really more joke than legend , its convoluted “ opera singer with a really bad memory ” set - up a bit too far - fetched for a true belief tale .

false	origins : in january 2014 , a number of disreputable web sites and social media posts began spreading claims that “ information taken directly from the cornell university legal information institute ” <PARA> proved that u . s . residents were not required to observe the affordable care act ’ s ( aca ) individual mandate that they obtain qualifying health insurance coverage in 2014 or pay a penalty , and that anyone who chose to do so was free to opt out of that requirement . <PARA> the information provided actually had nothing to do with cornell university or that school ’ s legal information institute — the claims simply cited a portion of the u . s . code ( a compilation of the general and permanent federal laws of the united states ) that can be found on cornell university ’ s web site because the cornell law school ’ s web site is one of several that provide complete online listings of the u . s . code for reference purposes . <PARA> the referenced information appears in title 42 , chapter 157 , subchapter vi , § 18115 of the u . s . code and reads as follows : <PARA> no individual , company , business , nonprofit entity , or health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage shall be required to participate in any federal health insurance program created under this act ( or any amendments made by this act ), or in any federal health insurance program expanded by this act ( or any such amendments ), and there shall be no penalty or fine imposed upon any such issuer for choosing not to participate in such programs . <PARA> the claim that this section of the law allows individuals to “ opt out ” of the obamacare health insurance mandate is erroneous , however ; a typical case of people viewing information out of context , misunderstanding it , and mistakenly construing to mean what they want it to say . as this section of the law clearly states , it applies to issuers of group or individual health insurance coverage , not purchasers of health insurance coverage . what this law says is that no one who provides health insurance may be forced to participate in any federal health insurance program ( e . g ., they don ’ t have to offer or sell coverage through government - created health insurance exchange marketplaces ) or be penalized for declining to do so . <PARA> the individual health insurance mandate is one of keystones of the affordable care act ’ s implementation . if it were truly optional rather than a requirement , then that fact would long since have been thoroughly publicized to the point of being common knowledge . it wouldn ’ t be an obscure nugget of information hidden in the depths of the u . s . code , revealed only through unreliable conspiracy web sites and social media posts .	
false	origins : on 14 october 2014 , the national report published an article claiming that the town of purdon , texas , had been quarantined after a local family of five tested positive for ebola . purdon is located 70 miles from dallas , the city in which ebola patient thomas eric duncan died of the disease . shortly after duncan ’ s death , the centers for disease control ( cdc ) disclosed that a nurse at texas health presbyterian hospital had contracted the hemorrhagic virus while caring for duncan . <PARA> the national report article referenced both the death of duncan and the illness of nurse nina pham as context for the claim about a quarantine in purdon : <PARA> purdon is located just 70 miles from dallas , texas , and the hospital that has cared for both american ebola patients , thomas eric duncan , and texas nurse , nina pham . <PARA> it has been verified that jack phillips returned from dallas last week while on business . shortly after arriving home , mr . phillips began exhibiting flu - like symptoms , but did not immediately go to the hospital . at this time his wife and children began showing similar symptoms , which provoked the family to get tested . doctors then learned that phillips , his wife , and three children had contracted ebola haemorrhagic fever . <PARA> it has been verified that jack phillips returned from dallas last week while on business . shortly after arriving home , mr . phillips began exhibiting flu - like symptoms , but did not immediately go to the hospital . at this time his wife and children began showing similar symptoms , which provoked the family to get tested . doctors then learned that phillips , his wife , and three children had contracted ebola haemorrhagic fever . <PARA> it further claimed that mr . “ phillis ” did not encounter either ebola patient in his travels : <PARA> “ as far as we know , jack phillis had not come in contact with neither the late thomas duncan or mrs . phan . it is perhaps possible that he was within a close proximity of the infected parties , but it is otherwise unknown as to how phillips was infected with ebola . <PARA> the cdc wasted no time sealing up the rest of the town ’ s denizens , and has stopped all traffic entering and exiting purdon , tx . as of 10 pm , oct . 13th area has been surrounded with police and cdc officials . communications with the locals seems to have been cut off , and press is currently awaiting an official statement from local authorities . <PARA> the cdc wasted no time sealing up the rest of the town ’ s denizens , and has stopped all traffic entering and exiting purdon , tx . as of 10 pm , oct . 13th area has been surrounded with police and cdc officials . communications with the locals seems to have been cut off , and press is currently awaiting an official statement from local authorities . <PARA> in just a few hours , the texas quarantine article was shared tens of thousands of times on facebook . however , national report is a fake news site that publishes sensational , made - up stories such as “ 15 year old who ‘ swatted ’ gamer convicted of domestic terrorism ,” “ solar panels drain the sun ’ s energy , experts say ,” and “ vince gilligan announces breaking bad season 6 .” while the yarn about additional ebola cases in texas is not nearly as lighthearted and perhaps more plausible than those japes , it ’ s still completely fabricated .

unproven	well , this has ‘ what does snopes say ?’ written all over it ! <PARA> origins : on 22 september 2014 , a strange story of body modification appeared on the social web . according to several circulating articles , a florida woman named jasmine tridevil underwent cosmetic surgery to add a “ third breast ” to her body . <PARA> in the initial frenzy of interest in jasmine tridevil and her purported third breast , lots of linking and re - posting of the same information and images occurred . however , few looked very deeply at the claims made by the woman shown in the images or her agents , or whether such a modification was even feasible . instead , multiple media outlets took her claims at face value and ran it as a straight news story with no corroboration ( other than self - provided images that could easily have been faked ): they contacted no one who knew or had seen ms . trideveil , they sought no third - party photographs of her , they didn ’ t verify the story with the doctor who supposedly performed her unusual enhancement surgery , nor did they probe her obvious pseudonym to determine her real name and background . <PARA> a new york magazine article about the woman ’ s third breast revealed a potentially relevant aspect of tridevil ’ s claim : according to that site , the florida woman claimed her surgeon forced her to sign a non - disclosure agreement , and therefore the obvious avenue of corroboration for her claim was closed off : <PARA> as jasmine tridevil ’ s claims about a third breast circulated the social web , most information reported came directly from the subject herself without any external confirmation . tridevil ’ s facebook page and youtube account were the primary sources for verification , despite the fact that both hosted only self - taken videos and photos ( and none actually shows the breast in question without a covering of clothing ). in one clip posted by tridevil , her “ breasts ” appeared to be of an entirely different skin tone than her facial skin and limbs : <PARA> another red flag in tridevil ’ s tale was her stated motivation : surgeons are ethically bound to decline performing cosmetic surgery on patients without certain mental health clearances ( i . e ., ensuring that patients do not have unrealistic expectations or motivations driven by psychological disorders ), and in an interview tridevil made the rather bizarre claim she set out to make herself look less attractive to men by opting to get a third breast implant : <PARA> no third party images of tridevil have emerged , and while she claims to have booked appearances on jimmy kimmel live and inside edition , no evidence has surfaced suggesting that they or any other media sources have vetted her story . <PARA> it ’ s also worth noting that the jasminetridevil . com domain was registered by someone named alisha hessler , and jasmine tridevil herself <PARA> bears a striking likeness to tampa - area massage therapist alisha jasmine hessler ( whose “ alisha ’ s golden touch ” massage web site now bears legends identifying her as “ provider of internet hoaxes since 2014 ” and <PARA> “ specialist in massage for three breasted women ”). photos on a modeling page linked with hessler closely matched the circulating images of jasmine tridevil , and profile pictures on hessler ’ s youtube page strongly resemble dthe woman in the “ third breast ” photos . <PARA> furthermore , an alisha jasmine hessler was taken into custody in hillsborough county , florida on 14 march 2013 , and subsequently charged with fraudulent use of personal information . <PARA> if hessler and tridevil are one and the same , the “ third breast ” story is also not the tampa woman ’ s first brush with viral fame : in december 2013 hessler made headlines for an incident in which she claimed she was beaten while on the way home from a club , then offered her attacker the choice of standing on a streetcorner wearing a dunce cap and holding a sign that read “ i beat women ” rather than being reported to police and charged with a crime . ( hessler also said “ she wanted to have the man who beat her sign a waiver allowing her to beat him for 10 minutes .”) according to local police , hessler withdrew her complaint and “ stopped returning [ their ] calls ” after she was pressed for details of the alleged attack . <PARA> we have submitted a request for an interview with jasmine to verify her claims and have not yet received a response .	
true	origins : the creature pictured above is the theridion grallator , more commonly known as the “ happy face spider .” the colorful arachnid is native to four of the hawaiian islands ( oahu , molokai , maui , hawaii ), where it is known in the local language as nananana makaki ’ i , or the <PARA> “ face - patterned spider .” ( the word grallator in its specific name is latin for “ stilt walker ,” a reference to the spider ’ s long and spindly legs .) <PARA> although some theridion grallator do bear markings resembling a happy face or a smiling clown on their abdomens as seen in the image shown above , the average person is unlikely to observe such markings without deliberately setting out to do so : the happy face spider is very small ( about 1 / 5 of an inch long ) and typically hides under forest leaves during the day , so one would generally have to search carefully to find an example and then examine it under a magnifying glass to glimpse a real - life example of the “ happy face ” markings . <PARA> additionally , theridion grallator is polymorphic and may exhibit one of several variant appearances depending upon such factors where it lives and what it eats , so not every happy face spider necessarily bears happy face markings :	
false	origins : the above - linked video clip purportedly shows , to <PARA> the accompaniment of an australian - accented announcer , a bungee jump over a river by a personage named <PARA> “ big doug ” that ends in tragedy when big doug ’ s head is bitten off by a crocodile who emerges from the depths with jaws open wide just as doug hits the water <PARA> headfirst . <PARA> one tell - tale clue to this video clip ’ s authenticity is the fact the audio cuts out halfway through . the reason for this editing is that a voice - over at the conclusion of the original , unedited clip reveals it to be a television commercial for foster ’ s beer : “ new foster ’ s hit tap . don ’ t lose your head .” <PARA> this 2003 foster ’ s commercial , promoting “ a new pouring system intended to give drinkers a consistent head on their pint ,” when it first aired drew complaints from hundreds of viewers who were disturbed by the seeming authenticity of the home video - style ad . as the uk newspaper the mirror reported at the time : <PARA> family groups are in uproar over the 30 second clip — shot in the form of a home movie — which shows a man leap off a crane into a river . as he skims the top of the water , a croc lunges at him . <PARA> the hand - held camera then pans in for a close up , showing the victim ’ s headless corpse dangling lifelessly on the bungee rope . laughing , the cameraman jokes “ crikey ! that ’ s got to hurt ” before the ad finishes with the slogan “ don ’ t lose your head ”. <PARA> the independent television commission has had 87 complaints since it was first aired on july 14 . <PARA> fosters said the ad was designed to promote a new system which gives drinkers a constant head on their pint . a spokesman said : “ our aim is to use foster ’ s ‘ no worries ’ aussie - style humour .”	
false	this widely circulated item claiming that a public high school in the hilliard city school district ( headquartered in columbus , ohio ) hosts a “ special room for muslims to pray in ” originated with events that took place in that area back in 2007 , when muslim students at some of the district ’ s high schools were allowed to leave their classrooms for 5 to 10 minutes each day and gather in a separate room for prayer during the holy month of ramadan : <PARA> as the principal of one of those schools explained , accommodating the request that muslim students be allowed to leave their classrooms briefly once during the day for prayer was deemed to be less disruptive to the educational process than requiring those students to seek excused absences every day throughout the month in order to adhere to their faiths : <PARA> however , it is not true that any of the hilliard city high schools has created “ a special room for muslims to pray in .” when muslim students needed a place of privacy where they could briefly engage in prayer outside the classroom during ramadan , each day they made temporary use of a space that was promptly returned to its original function afterwards : <PARA> as stated on the infrequently answered questions section of the hilliard city school district ’ s web site , none of the hilliard city schools encompasses a room regularly or permanently dedicated to such a purpose : <PARA> additionally , stacie raterman , community relations coordinator for hilliard city schools , told us that “ hilliard city schools has three high schools . there are no prayer rooms in any of the buildings .” <PARA> many iterations of this rumor have been spread with the inclusion of additional text taken from an article about president obama ’ s supposedly having announced a nationwide muslim outreach program for children from grades k - 12 . that article is also false , nothing more than a leg pull originally published by a fake news site in september 2013 .	
false	houston , tx – houston police officers confronted and arrested a suspected terrorist who was wearing body armor with the isis insignia embroidered on it on september 5th . these photos of the arrest and suspect have been filtering around the internet . <PARA> one thing is sure . isis ( or those who admire isis ) are here in the usa and they want to kill americans . <PARA> the media is ignoring this story and the houston pd did not respond to a request for comment . <PARA> origins : this photograph of a supposed isis ( islamic state in iraq and syria ) operative hit the internet in september 2014 , typically published on disreputable web sites along with claims that he was a “ suspected terrorist ” with “ body armor ” who had been arrested in houston ( and that the presence of isis terrorists in the u . s . was too mundane a <PARA> story for the american media to bother with ). <PARA> of course , that plot line leaves one wondering why an infiltrator from a foreign terrorist group would be parading around the u . s . in apparel bearing prominent markings that clearly advertise his affiliation . are isis operatives truly that bad at undercover work , or have they been consuming too much american popular media and believe that ’ s how evil bad guy teams really work ? <PARA> the presence of other images showing the “ suspected terrorist ” posing for friendly , beaming photos with police officers , as well as the complete lack of any news accounts documenting the apprehension of an isis operative on u . s . soil ( which would be a huge news story given the amount of attention isis is currently generating in the american media ), belie the notion that the pictured man was a dangerous foreign infiltrator taken into custody by houston police . what ’ s captured in these photos was likely either a police training exercise or some form of performance / prank that played out in friendly fashion : <PARA> shortly after the brewster county sheriff ’ s department posted these photos and the claim of a “ houston isis arrest ” on their facebook page , they issued an update noting that the fbi had informed them the claim was false . <PARA> a similar photo of a man in isis - like garb patronizing a houston deli has been posted in tandem with the image shown in the example above . the origin of that photo is currently unknown , but no confirmable evidence links it to an arrest of a genuine isis operative either : <PARA> it ’ s more difficult than many may think to get some real answers or responses about the picture that has been going around . the photo shows a man supposedly wearing an isis logo at a houston restaurant . <PARA> the fbi said they know about this story , but they were not aware of any arrests being made and were also unaware of any specific credible threats within the houston territory . <PARA> so for now , a lot about the picture remains unknown , but it ’ s definitely got a lot of people talking .	
false	none of us needed any reminders after the events of september 11 about what an ugly place the world could be , but we continued to receive those reminders nonetheless . in this case , there were plenty of anti - semitic , anti - zionist , and anti - israeli groups eager to use the horrors of september 11 as fodder for propaganda to serve their own political ends . <PARA> the pieces quote above scarely merit the dignity of a rebuttal . one need only have read newspaper accounts of the thousands of deaths , viewed tv news interviews with grieving families , and scanned the lists of the dead and missing to know that the terrorist attack on new york city claimed the lives of christians , jews , and muslims ; agnostics , atheists , and the non - religious alike . no religion was spared , no denomination singled out . ordinary people of all nationalities suffered . no miracles , human intervention , foreknowledge , coincidence , or vagaries of fate saved more than a few world trade center workers from meeting their deaths that day . <PARA> nonetheless , those with something to gain by sowing the seeds of divisiveness would have had us believe that israel had advance warning of the world trade center attack and managed to notify 4 , 000 israeli nationals who worked in the two towers about the upcoming horror , but that they left the u . s . completely unaware of the danger . <PARA> (“ hello , david rosenberg ? this is the mossad . listen , don ’ t go to work on tuesday . yeah , another terrorist attack on the u . s . ... call in sick . and remember , not a word to any of your gentile relatives , friends , or co - workers .”) <PARA> and even though this scoop to top all scoops winged its way all over the internet , the american press apparently remained completely in the dark about the nefarious scheme . is it any surprise that this story emanated from sources such as pravda and al - manar , the pro - palestinian “ channel of arabs and muslims ”? <PARA> why would israel follow such a course of action , betray its staunchest ally , and doom thousands of innocent americans to death ? there were no rational answers to that question , only ugly propagandistic ones . “ israel wanted to draw america into a final showdown with its arab enemies , so they didn ’ t warn us ” — the same type of conspiracy theory that posited our leaders knew about the impending japanese attack on pearl harbor allowed it to happen in order to galvanize public support for a war . old theory , new clothes . even darker was the implication that israel , not content to wait for an attack which would embroil america in a middle eastern war , forced the issue by pulling off a monstrous act of terrorism again the usa themselves . <PARA> “ it is clear to all that the jews / israel have most to gain and should be considered as a possible source behind this act ,” we were told . those who authored and disseminated this kind of rubbish were really the ones with the most to gain . <PARA> news accounts in the wake of the 9 / 11 terrorist attacks demonstrated that jews and israelis did die in the world trade towers that day . a 18 september 2001 cnn article reported on one manhattan synagogue that had lost six of its members in the attacks , five in the towers and one at the pentagon . a 21 september 2001 abc news article showed that at ( then ) last count 400 jews were killed in the attack . and a 21 september 2001 new york times article detailed efforts then underway to identify the jews whose bodies remained beneath the world trade center rubble . <PARA> the rumor apparently originated with a relatively innocuous israeli news report speculating that about 4 , 000 israelis were believed to have been in the areas of the world trade center and the pentagon at the time of the 9 / 11 attacks , and that tidbit quickly morphed into the idea that 4 , 000 israelis — all of them employees of companies housed in one or the other of the wtc towers — had all suspiciously failed to show up for work on 9 / 11 : <PARA> but later analysis showed that the proportion of jews among occupants of the world trade center who were killed in the 9 / 11 attacks was the same as their proportion of the general new york area population : <PARA> additional information :	
false	for most of us who watched the televised joint hearings before the senate select committee on secret military assistance to iran and the nicaraguan opposition and the house select committee to investigate covert arms transactions with iran ( better known as the “ iran - contra hearings ,” held by congress to determine whether the reagan administration had secretly and illegally sold arms to iran in order to secure the release of american hostages , then used the profits from those sales to fund the contra rebels in nicaragua ) in 1987 , the enduring image we came away with was a memory of an unapologetic and resolute lt . col . oliver north delivering testimony in a marine uniform . north , who was a central figure in the plan to secretly ship arms to iran despite a u . s . trade and arms embargo , and who as a national security council aide directed efforts to raise private and foreign funds for the contras despite a congressional prohibition on u . s . government agencies ’ providing military aid to the nicaraguan rebels , testified before congress under a grant of limited immunity in july 1987 . <PARA> although north had been granted limited immunity for his testimony , he was later convicted of criminal charges related to iran - contra activities ( a conviction that was eventually overturned on the grounds that witnesses had been influenced by his immunized testimony ). one of the charges against north was that he had received a $ 16 , 000 home security system paid for out of the proceeds of the iran - contra affair and had forged documents to cover his receipt of an illegal gratuity . north admitted that he knew the security system was a “ gift ” but maintained he never inquired about who had paid for it or how it was financed , and he was insistent that he needed the security system because the government had failed to provide adequate protection against international terrorists for him and his family . <PARA> the terrorist north mentioned in his testimony was not osama bin laden , however . to the extent that bin laden was known to the western world in 1987 , it was not as a “ terrorist ” but as one of the u . s .- backed “ freedom fighters ” participating in the war against the soviet occupation of afghanistan . osama bin laden ’ s hatred of the u . s . and conversion to “ terrorist ” status is not believed to have come about until the gulf war of 1990 - 91 , when he was outspokenly critical of saudi arabian dependence upon the u . s . military and denounced u . s . support of a “ corrupt , materialist , and irreligious ” saudi monarchy . ( the saudi arabian government stripped bin laden of his citizenship in 1994 for his funding of militant fundamentalist islamic groups .) <PARA> oliver north did not testify about or mention the name osama bin laden during the iran - contra hearings . he claimed that threats against his life had been made by terrorist abu nidal , telling a congressional committee : <PARA> to emphasize his point , north showed the committee a blow - up of a newspaper article detailing the atrocities of abu nidal and recalled that an 11 - year - old girl named natasha simpson , the daughter of an associated press news editor , had been gunned down ( along with four other americans ) during an attack by an abu nidal group on the el al terminal at the rome airport in december 1985 . north also later claimed that an attempt on his life had been made five months before his congressional testimony at the instigation of libyan leader mohmmar qadaffi : <PARA> so no , oliver north didn ’ t warn us back in 1987 about osama bin laden ’ s “ potential threat to the security of the world ” or suggest that bin laden be hunted down by “ an assassin team ,” nor was he given the brush - off by a clueless senator “ who disagreed with this approach .” eventually , col . north drafted his own response to this piece of misinformation : <PARA> variations : one variant of this item concluded with the statement “ the senator disagreed with this approach and that was all that was shown of the clip . if anyone is interested , the senator turned out to be none other than ... al gore .” senator al gore of tennessee was not a member of the united states senate select committee on secret military assistance to iran and the nicaraguan opposition and therefore did not take part in the questioning of any witnesses before the committee .	
false	on 12 april 1986 , mahmoud mahmoud atta ( also known as mahmoud abad ahmad ), a 33 - year - old jordanian native , ambushed a passenger bus in the israeli - occupied west bank . atta ( working with an accomplice ) stopped the bus with a firebomb , then opened fire on it with an uzi , killing the driver and seriously wounding three passengers . <PARA> atta was arrested in venezuela a year later , but because venezuela had no extradition treaty with israel , venezuelan officials deported him for immigration violations to his country of origin , the united states . ( atta was a naturalized u . s . citizen .) atta was arrested by fbi agents upon arrival at kennedy <PARA> international airport and held in prison in the u . s . for more than three years before being extradited to israel for trial in october 1990 . his extradition was controversial because the nature of the extradition treaty in effect required that the accused ’ s offense must be of a “ non - political nature ,” and atta maintained that he had committed political rather than criminal offenses . nonetheless , the u . s . courts upheld israel ’ s extradition request on the grounds that atta had attacked civilian rather than military targets and had therefore committed regular criminal acts , not political acts aimed at the overthrow of a government . in october 1991 , an israeli court found atta guilty and sentenced him to life imprisonment . <PARA> fast forward ten years . as the u . s . tried to piece together the terrorist plot that resulted in four hijacked airliners and the destruction of both world trade center towers , they discovered that the mastermind was apparently one mohamad atta , who had entered into the u . s . unnoticed and spent well over a year there receiving training at more than one american flight school . newspapers ( both domestic and foreign ) begin to criticize u . s . intelligence and law enforcement agencies for allowing a known terrorist to slip into the country so easily : <PARA> [ the australian , 2001 ] <PARA> [ san francisco chronicle , 2001 ] <PARA> [ boston globe , 2001 ] <PARA> finally the boston globe , at least , caught onto the error and realized that the bus bomber and the hijacker were two different people with the same name : <PARA> clearly , the message quoted at the head of this article was wrong in its facts . the atta who attacked a bus was arrested by the fbi and extradited to israel , not “ captured by israelis ,” and his extradition didn ’ t take place until two years after reagan left office . in fact , the oslo agreement itself wasn ’ t signed until nearly five years after reagan left office . all of this makes it rather difficult to support the claim that atta was released under the terms of the oslo agreement at the insistence of “ president ronald reagan and secretary of state george schultz ” ( which explains why this information “ was missing from later reports ”). <PARA> what puzzled us was why newspapers , much less “ us authorities ,” should have been confused as to whether the two attas were the same man ( especially since one was fourteen years older than the other ) or described atta as someone “ suspected of ” or “ implicated in ” a bus attack for which he had already been convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment ten years earlier . ( according to the jerusalem post , atta the bus bomber “ was eventually freed after the supreme court ruled there were faults in the extradition process ,” but the article did not state when this reversal occurred . newspaper accounts as late as 1993 still described atta as “ serving a life sentence in an israeli prison .”) what we had here appeared to be a case of mistaken identity ; the mystery we couldn ’ t solve was why the mistake was made in the first place . <PARA> in mid - 2002 the “ we freed atta ” claim was twinned in e - mail with another popular internet canard , the “ oliver north warned us about osama ” falsity . north did speak up about a terrorist during the iran - contra hearings , but it was abu nidal he mentioned , not osama bin laden . <PARA> additional information : <PARA> wtc bomber was never held in israel ( the jerusalem post )	
unproven	an item about a child supposedly named “ le - a ” began circulating on the internet in early october 2008 . <PARA> while the unusually named child in versions circulated back then was almost always said to attend “ a school in livingston parish ( louisiana ),” we encountered one stray version that stated “ this child attends a school in richland county , georgia ” and another that said “ this child attends a school in detroit , mi .” <PARA> the closing line of the anecdote (“ the dash don ’ t be silent ”) positions the person who bestowed the moniker as african - american through its phrasing in african american vernacular english ( aave ), also known as ebonics : such use of “ don ’ t be ” in place of “ isn ’ t ” is particular to aave . <PARA> the racist and disapproving aspect of this item is clearly expressed in comments appended to many versions , such as “ and we let these people vote !” and “ they live among us , they vote , and they breed !”: <PARA> as to whether there is such a child , despite our hearing from dozens and dozens of readers who have claimed to us a girl bearing such a name was in their class or was in a class taught by a relative or acquaintance of theirs , we ’ ve yet to find documentation of anyone ’ s bearing a name of “ le - a ” that is pronounced “ ledasha ” ( or any other way ). <PARA> what we have found through searching online social security databases ( which are not complete repositories of information and thus aren ’ t the final say in the matter ) showed that while there were more than 4 , 000 “ lea ” s , there weren ’ t any “ le - a ” s . for what it ’ s worth , references in various news stories document that “ ledasha ” ( fully spelled out , not in a “ le - a ” form ) has indeed been used as a girl ’ s name . <PARA> while the original e - mail quoted above dated from early october 2008 , the first online appearance of the “ ledasha ” story we ’ ve found so far is at least a month older . in that 5 september 2008 entry from claytravis . net , “ ledasha ” spelled her name with an apostrophe : <PARA> as to the use of symbols within ( or in place of ) names , while such practice is rare , it is not unknown . <PARA> in 1993 , recording artist prince changed his name to an orthographic representation he dubbed “ love symbol ” and styled himself “ the artist formerly known as prince ” before reverting in 2000 to his original name . and the author of the 2008 book the fortune cookie chronicles renders her name as jennifer 8 lee . <PARA> symbols and letters can be combined to form words that are easily pronounceable based on the understood sounds assigned to various symbols : the male name “ matt ” could be rendered as “ m <USER> for instance , with most people easily working out how to say it . however , such a system of creative ( or “ kre8tiv ”) spellings has some drawbacks , which we ’ ll highlight by looking at how those factors would affect a name like “ le - a ”: <PARA> in the ten years since we first published this article , we ’ ve heard from hundreds of people who have claimed that they knew a student , classmate , patient , neighbor , co - worker — or relative thereof — named “ le - a ,” yet the existence of any person actually so named remains elusively undocumented .	
mixture	origins : since the 1950s , rumors have been aired at every college in the u . s . that playboy conducted surveys of drinking on college campuses and used them to compile annual lists of “ america ’ s best party schools ” ( rumors usually spread by students proudly proclaiming that their own school had achieved the # 1 slot <PARA> in the latest ranking ). however , not until the late 1980s did playboy actually publish a ranking of this nature , and it was never an annual feature of the magazine . <PARA> through the end of 2006 , such a list had appeared in the pages of playboy only three times : in its january 1987 , november 2002 , and may 2006 issues . however , there were two precursors to the full - blown list : the september 1968 issue identified the university of wisconsin at madison as the most permissive campus ( drawn from a sample of 25 universities ) and dubbed it “ the party school ” ( primarily because it served beer in the student union ); likewise the october 1976 issue named ucla tops in “ campus action .” <PARA> in more recent years playboy has sometimes republished college rankings compiled by others , such as the annual list of the top 20 party schools as determined by the princeton review . <PARA> prior to 2002 , playboy had compiled their own list of “ party schools ” only once . they gave their reason for reprising this feature in 2002 as : <PARA> campus legend has it that playboy does a yearly ranking of america ’ s top party schools . truth is , we haven ’ t done such a roundup since 1987 , when we tagged cal state - chico the craziest campus in the nation . chico has had bragging rights for 15 years , causing students to binge with pride while parents and administrators have dried out fraternities and sororities and canceled halloween . some students have sent us e - mails that say “ don ’ t you dare say chico state . i ’ m sick of having to defend it . it ’ s all because of your article 15 years ago !” why do another ranking now ? the kids demanded it , our public relations department is bombarded with calls from students who wonder where their schools rank . we wanted to hear what goes down on campus — the good , the bad and blurry — in your own words , more than 1500 of you wrote . these are your stories . <PARA> the information for playboy ‘ s 1987 list of party schools had been compiled in 1986 from the reports of playboy staffers who interviewed campus club leaders , dorm rush chairmen , fraternity presidents and other campus social studs at more than 250 schools nationwide . which leads us straight into the legend which has sprung up around this famed list : <PARA> then there ’ s the computer bulletin board - fueled story about the magazine ( usually playboy ) that was ranking the top 10 party schools in the country . students at the university of wisconsin were taken aback when their school didn ’ t rate even an honorable mention ; after all , everyone knows about the legendary cheesehead antics that go on in madison . but when the kids contacted the magazine , they were told : “ we don ’ t rank professionals .” <PARA> gentle souls that they are , playboy referenced this bit of folklore ( a charming bit of blarney which been told about any number of schools , cheese - enhanced and otherwise , for many years prior to 1987 ) and did their best console those who were left off the january 1987 compilation by stating , “ if your school isn ’ t listed , it ’ s probably because we didn ’ t include professionals .” <PARA> for those who really want to know how their institutions of higher learning fare now in the “ party school ” category , princeton review ’ s latest eagerly - awaited annual ranking of the top 20 party schools was issued as follows in august 2014 , based on a survey of 130 , 000 students at 379 schools : <PARA> barbara “ party line ” mikkelson

false	origins : in october 2006 , news outlets in oregon and hawaii recounted a tale involving 16 - year - old emily streight from carlton , oregon , who in february 2003 had jotted a note with her name and address , taped it into a 12 -

year - old honolulu boy named keoni ” purportedly found the missive “ on the beach after a luau ” and returned it to emily along with a note of his own : <PARA> streight got a letter last week from a 16 - year - old honolulu boy named keoni . <PARA> keoni found the bottle on a hawaiian beach following a luau . <PARA> he wrote a note to streight , enclosed it in an envelope and mailed it to her . he enclosed her original note as well . <PARA> “ i opened the envelope , read through the letter and thought , ‘ no way ,'” streight said . “ then my note fell out , and i thought , ‘ wow !'” <PARA> keoni did not send a picture , just a one - page typed note . it began , “ aloha , emily . my name is keoni . i ’ m a 16 - year - old boy in kaimuki , a neighborhood in honolulu , hawaii .” <PARA> he went on to tell her his ancestry was a mix of hawaiian , japanese , portuguese and chinese , that he likes to surf , kayak and skateboard , and that he plays wide receiver on the football team . <PARA> keoni said he and a friend had finished a luau on the beach . they were cleaning up afterward when they found the water bottle and spotted the note inside . <PARA> he said he had trouble reading the address , which had faded badly , but his girlfriend helped him figure it out . he said she wasn ’ t thrilled about him writing to a girl , but he told her not to worry , because she lived 2 , 000 miles away . <PARA> keoni said he had spent his entire life in hawaii , but was thinking about going to college on the mainland . <PARA> he said his brother has friends at linfield college and his sister has a boyfriend at the university of oregon . but he said he ’ d rather go to college in california so he could keep up with his surfing . <PARA> he wrapped up , “ i hope you ’ re happy to get your letter back . it seems like it has been traveling for a long time . aloha , keoni .” <PARA> keoni found the bottle on a hawaiian beach following a luau . <PARA> he wrote a note to streight , enclosed it in an envelope and mailed it to her . he enclosed her original note as well . <PARA> “ i opened the envelope , read through the letter and thought , ‘ no way ,'” streight said . “ then my note fell out , and i thought , ‘ wow !'” <PARA> keoni did not send a picture , just a one -

in - a - bottle <PARA> stories are common news fodder , but this one was a bit extraordinary considering the route and distance emily ’ s plastic bottle would have had to have traversed in order to reach its eventual landing site in honolulu : down panther creek to the north yamhill river , then down the yamhill river itself to the willamette river , from there into to the columbia river , then all the way to the coast and out into the pacific , finally traveling thousands of miles across the pacific to the hawaiian islands . <PARA> however , after the story broke and reporters were unsuccessful in attempting to contact the mysterious keoni ( the return address he had provided was genuine , but no one by his name lived there ), linda coble , a reporter with khon -

false	at about 8 : 30 am on sunday , 11 december 2005 , a crab fisherman working the open waters east of the farallon islands , about 18 miles off the coast of san francisco , spotted a whale that had become entangled in the nylon ropes that link crab pots . the whale was a female humpback , about 45 to 50 feet in length and weighing an estimated 50 tons , who had likely become snared while traversing the humpbacks ’ usual migratory route between the northern california coast and baja california : <PARA> a rescue team was hastily assembled , and by 2 : 30 pm divers had evaluated the situation and determined that the imperiled whale was so badly entangled in the crab pot lines that the only way to save her was to dive beneath the surface and cut the nylon ropes that were ensnaring her . as james moskito , one of the rescue divers , reported : <PARA> four divers spent about an hour cutting the nylon ropes with a special curved knife , a risky undertaking since a single flip of the gargantuan mammal ’ s tail could easily have killed any of them . eventually they freed the humpback , a feat that a representative of the marine mammal center ( mmc ) in marin county described as the first successful attempt on the west coast to free an entangled humpback . <PARA> the divers told a san francisco chronicle reporter that the whale seemingly thanked them for its deliverance once the rescue operation was complete : <PARA> while the textual element to this item is largely truth - based , the accompanying photograph ( as shown above ) has nothing to do with the referenced event : it captures an encounter between cameraman marco queral and a 50 - ft . female humpback whale which took place nearly four years later in the south pacific . <PARA> another image of an ensnared sea denizen has also been used in conjunction with this item , although it too does not depict the event described . this picture shows what was described in news accounts as a different whale photographed trying to escape from a net in which it had become trapped off australia ’ s gold coast in september 2005 :

unproven	as folklorist jan harold brunvand notes , the above - quoted legend has been part of the canon of contemporary lore since at least the mid - 1980s . it is an unusual offering in that it serves as an expression of a not uncommon view canadians hold of the u . s . as a crime - riddled country . <PARA> there are two slightly different interpretations of the legend , depending upon how one reads the story . if one assumes the car ’ s four occupants are bad guys engaged in an unspecified form of illegal activity at the time of their vehicle ’ s being stopped for having a malfunctioning tail light , the story becomes one of a display of guilt revealing the actual nature of things — the canadian lawman is twigged to these guys ’ being up to something nefarious by their instinctively assuming the “ spread your legs and grab the paint job ” stance . the bemused mountie thereby nets himself a fine catch of american bad guys purely by happenstance . <PARA> alternatively , if one assumes the four men in the car hadn ’ t been up to anything untoward , the story becomes a comment on conditions in the u . s ., where crime ( according to widespread belief in canada ) runs rampant . under this interpretation , the four men automatically position themselves to be searched not because they are lawbreakers , but because they are used to dealing with american police — who themselves supposedly have to deal with so many criminals ( and so few law - abiding citizens ) that they now save time by figuring everyone they stop is a rotter .	
false	one of the signs of creeping old fogeyism is finding out how many of the irrefutable truths we learned as youths turned out to be false . today ’ s being flag day reminds me of yet another cardinal rule i assimilated as a child which i later discovered was wrong : that if an american flag is allowed to touch the ground , it should be burned . <PARA> the rules we observe with respect to our flag are laid out in the u . s . code . ( these codes specify how the flag should be displayed , but they do not establish any enforcement of legal penalties against those who violate them .) the notion that the u . s . flag should be burned after touching the ground is a long - held misconception based upon a conflation of two different parts of the flag code . <PARA> title 4 , chapter 1 , section 8 of the u . s . code (“ respect for flag “) states in paragraph ( b ) that : <PARA> and in paragraph ( k ) it states : <PARA> the fallacy about burning a ground - touched flag arises from the mistaken beliefs that a flag which has been allowed to touch the ground is no longer “ suitable for display ” and must therefore be destroyed , and that the only proper form of disposal for a flag is to burn it . these beliefs reflect a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the flag code . <PARA> although the flag should never be allowed to touch anything beneath it ( including the ground ), it is not automatically rendered unfit for display should this situation occur . the proper course of action in such a case is simply to adjust the flag , or the item ( s ) below it , so that they are no longer touching . even if the flag has become soiled from contact with the ground ( or something else ) to the extent that is no longer suitable for display , it need not be disposed of : it is perfectly permissible to wash or dry clean a dirty flag in order to render it fit for display again . the flag need be destroyed only when it has become irreparably unsuitable for display due to circumstances such as fading , tattering , tearing , staining , partial burning , mutilation , or defacement . <PARA> also , burning is not the only acceptable method of disposing of a flag , just the preferred one . the intent of the code specifying a “ dignified way ” of disposal is to prevent a no - longer - usable flag from ending up in an undignified setting , such as being dumped into a trash can amidst a bunch of rotting garbage or thrown atop a junk heap . destroying the flag by burning it ensures that the flag will not end up in such surroundings , but other options exist , such as handing it over to one of the many civic associations ( e . g ., boy scouts , veterans of foreign wars , the american legion ) who accept non - serviceable flags for proper disposal .	
mixture	origins : nearly everyone who has ever watched television in the western world is at least passingly familiar with gilligan ’ s island . the series about seven castaways on an uncharted island ran on cbs for three years in the mid - 1960s and has since become one of the most popular syndicated shows of all time and a mainstay of american popular culture . we revel in dissecting the show ’ s minutiae , pondering such questions as “ why did the howells bring suitcases full of money on a three - hour tour ?” and “ how come <PARA> gilligan wears the same clothes every day , but they never get dirty or torn ?” the subject of one of the more enduring trivia questions over the years has been “ what was gilligan ’ s full name ?” was ‘ gilligan ’ his first name or his last name ? and what was his full name ? <PARA> a few events in the early 1990s spurred the claim that gilligan was a surname , and that the character ’ s first name was “ willy ”: tbs finally aired the pilot of gilligan ’ s island ( an episode that had never been broadcast ) in 1992 , and tv guide announced in 1993 that it had discovered ( from an early press release ) that gilligan ’ s first name was supposed to be “ willy .” somehow the pilot , the first regularly - broadcast episode , and the tv guide claim became conflated in the public ’ s mind , producing a garbled and oft - repeated bit of internet trivia : <PARA> gilligan of gilligan ’ s island had a first name that was only used once , on the never - aired pilot show . his first name was willy . it was mentioned once in the first episode on their radio ’ s newscast about the wreck . <PARA> some of the confusion here stems from the fact that the familiar group of gilligan ’ s island actors did not all appear in the pilot episode . before the series went into production , the part of the professor was re - cast with a new actor , and the characters named ginger and bunny ( both secretaries in the pilot ), were transformed into a movie star and a small - town farm girl and re - cast with new actresses as well . because of this change in casting , the pilot was unusable as a regular - season episode and was not broadcast until tbs finally aired it in <PARA> 1992 . <PARA> the first episode (“ two on a raft ,” first aired on 26 september 1964 ) opened with the castaways shipwrecked on the island , and the details of how they came to be there were not shown . in order to provide the viewing audience with some background information about the characters , therefore , a scene in which the castaways listen to a radio broadcast about themselves was inserted into the first episode . the broadcast informed us that the skipper was an “ old salt in these waters ”; that thurston howell was “ one of the world ’ s wealthiest men ” ( and , contrary to the theme song , a billionaire rather than a mere millionaire ); that mrs . howell was a “ socially prominent international hostess ”; that mary ann was from winfield , kansas , and worked at the winfield general store ; that ginger “ boarded the boat after a nightclub singing engagement still wearing the evening dress from her last performance ”; and that the professor was a “ research scientist and well - known scoutmaster .” the broadcast mentions the characters ’ full names as well : <PARA> the broadcast also said only that the crew included a “ young first mate named gilligan .” no other information about the character was provided , and no episode ever mentioned any other name for the gilligan character . <PARA> as far as the show was concerned , gilligan had but a single name . no other name was ever associated with character within the context of the series , and whether ‘ gilligan ’ was his given name or his surname was never established . some conceptual material for the series did make reference to the name ‘ willy gilligan ,’ which indicates that gilligan ’ s island creator sherwood schwartz did give some consideration to a full name for the character , and that ‘ gilligan ’ was once considered as being a surname . however , that full name was apparently one of the many details that never made it past the conceptual stage and into the show . moreover , when sherwood schwartz later explained how he came to choose the characters ’ names , he made it clear that ‘ gilligan ’ had to have been the character ’ s first name , because the howells were the only characters ever referred to by their last names : <PARA> in a further effort to make the characters prototypes rather than completely flesh and blood , i decided to call them only by first names or nicknames — excepting mr . and mrs . thurston howell iii , of course , because that would have been out of keeping with their characters . <PARA> but if ‘ gilligan ’ was the character ’ s first name ( as indicated by the above quotation ), then his full name couldn ’ t possibly be ‘ willy gilligan ,’ and we ’ re left with mutually exclusive explanations . the best sense we can make out of it is that series creator sherwood schwartz briefly considered naming his main character ‘ willy gilligan ,’ thought better of it , and decided to use ‘ gilligan ’ alone as a first name . ( other elements from the original series treatment were also dropped along the way , such as the idea that gilligan was an ex - navy cook who knew nothing about the sea but , desperate for a job , convinced the skipper that he was an experienced seaman ; instead , the show ’ s theme song simply cast gilligan as a “ mighty sailin ’ man .”) <PARA> ruminations that took place long after the original series was canceled have added to the confusion . actor bob denver , who played the role of gilligan , suggested that the idea of ‘ willy ’ as a first name for the character was merely speculative , something that came up in idle conversation about a name that might have been chosen if the character ever needed a full name : <PARA> one of tv ’ s great bits of trivia is gilligan ’ s first name . none was ever revealed on the show , but years later on a talk show bob denver claimed that he had talked the matter over with the show ’ s creator / producer sherwood schwartz , and they decided that if gilligan ever did need a first name , it would be “ willie .” <PARA> but sherwood schwartz maintained that bob denver considered ‘ gilligan ’ to be the character ’ s first name : <PARA> to this day , almost every time i see bob denver we still argue . he thinks gilligan is his first name , and i think it ’ s his last name . because in the original presentation , it ’ s willy gilligan . but he doesn ’ t believe it , and he doesn ’ t want to discuss it . he insists the name is gilligan . <PARA> so , there ’ s no right answer for this one . no , no name other than ‘ gilligan ’ was ever used for the title character in gilligan ’ s island , not even in the original pilot . yes , there is evidence that series creator sherwood schwartz considered using the name ‘ willy gilligan ’ during the series ’ planning stages . on the other hand , there ’ s also evidence that schwartz ultimately decided ‘ gilligan ’ was the character ’ s first name , precluding the use of ‘ willy gilligan ’ as a full name . pick your favorite explanation and run with it . <PARA> additional information : the video clip below shows a “ radio broadcast ” segment added to the first broadcast episode of gilligan ’ s island in order to explain the characters ’ backgrounds to the viewing audience ; it provides the first and last names of all the castaways ( except gilligan ).

made jerky treats in all of its stores by the end of 2014 : <PARA> petco became the first national pet retail chain to remove all china - made dog and cat treats when it announced that it would stop selling the products in its more than 1 , 300 locations by the end of [ 2014 ]. <PARA> “ we know some pet parents are wary of dog and cat treats made in china , especially chicken jerky products , and we ’ ve heard their concerns ,” said petco ceo jim myers in a statement . “ as a leader in the industry and the trusted partner for our pet parents , we ’ re eager to make this transition and to expand our assortment of safe and healthy treats , the majority of which are made right here in the u . s . very simply , we feel this decision is in the best interest of the pets we all love and , ultimately , for our business .” <PARA> petco said that it doesn ’ t want its customers to take any chances . “ we know the fda hasn ’ t yet identified a direct cause for the reported illnesses , but we decided the uncertainty of the situation outweighs the lack of actual proof ,” said myers . “ it has taken some time and careful thought to get to this point , but we ’ re proud to make the change and we believe our customers will be pleased with it as well .” <PARA> “ we know some pet parents are wary of dog and cat treats made in china , especially chicken jerky products , and we ’ ve heard their concerns ,” said petco ceo jim myers in a statement . “ as a leader in the industry and the trusted partner for our pet parents , we ’ re eager to make this transition and to expand our assortment of safe and healthy treats , the majority of which are made right here in the u . s . very simply , we feel this decision is in the best interest of the pets we all love and , ultimately , for our business .” <PARA> petco said that it doesn ’ t want its customers to take any chances . “ we know the fda hasn ’ t yet identified a direct cause for the reported illnesses , but we decided the uncertainty of the situation outweighs the lack of actual proof ,” said myers . “ it has taken some time and careful thought to get to this point , but we ’ re proud to make the change and we believe our customers will be pleased with it as well .” <PARA> however , the fda still has not definitively established a causative link between pet illness and the consumption of jerky treats , stating that although they “ continue to receive complaints of dogs experiencing illness that their owners or veterinarians associate with consumption of chicken jerky products ... to date , scientists have not been able to determine a definitive cause for the reported illnesses ”: <PARA> although the fda has been actively investigating the reports of illnesses , no definitive cause has been determined . the ongoing global investigation is complex , multifaceted and includes a wide variety of experts at the fda including toxicologists , epidemiologists , veterinary researchers , forensic chemists , microbiologists , field investigators and senior agency officials . <PARA> at best , the fda has so far been able to perform necropsies on a few dozen dogs whose deaths were attributed to jerky treats . that agency found half that those deaths did not appear to be related to jerky pet treats , and the causes of death in the other half may or may not have been linked to the consumption of jerky treats : <PARA> fda has had the opportunity to perform necropsies ( post - mortem examinations ) on 26 dogs , 13 of which appeared to have causes of death not related to consumption of jerky pet treats . of the remaining 13 cases , an association with consumption of jerky pet treats could not be ruled out . eleven of these dogs had indications of kidney disease and two involved gastrointestinal disease . <PARA> on 22 october 2013 , the fda released a progress report noting that the “ rate of complaints associated with jerky pet treats dropped sharply after several well - known brands were removed from the market in january 2013 ,” but reiterating that the “ fda has not yet identified a cause for the reported illnesses ”: <PARA> as of september 24 , 2013 , fda has received approximately 3000 complaints of illness related to consumption of chicken , duck , or sweet potato jerky treats , most of which involve products imported from china . the reports involve more than 3600 dogs , 10 cats and include more than 580 deaths . fda continues to investigate the cause of these illnesses in conjunction with our partners in the veterinary laboratory investigation and response network ( vet - lirn ), a network of animal health laboratories affiliated with fda . <PARA> the complaints fda has received include adverse events involving different sizes , ages and breeds of dogs . about 60 percent of the reports are for gastrointestinal illness ( with or without elevated liver enzymes ) and about 30 percent relate to kidney or urinary signs . the remaining 10 percent of cases involve a variety of other signs , including <PARA> convulsions , tremors , hives , and skin irritation . <PARA> it is important to note that the reported illnesses are not limited to jerky treats made from chicken . we have received complaints about duck and sweet potato jerky treats and related products , such as jerky - wrapped rawhide treats . we know that the illnesses and deaths reported are mostly linked to jerky pet treats sourced from china . pet owners should be aware , however , that manufacturers do not need to list the country of origin for each ingredient used in their products . <PARA> fda has noticed a sharp drop in the number of complaints since several treat products were removed from the market in january 2013 following a study by the new york state department of agriculture and marketing ( nysdam ) that revealed low levels of antibiotic residues in those products . recalled products included several well - known brands believed to comprise the majority of the jerky pet treat market . fda believes it unlikely that the reports of illness it has received are caused by the presence of antibiotic residues in jerky pet treat products . rather , because the brands that were recalled represent a significant portion of the jerky pet treat market in the united states , fda theorizes , therefore , that the drop off in complaints since january 2013 is the more likely the result of the general lack of availability jerky pet treat products . <PARA> to date , testing for contaminants in jerky pet treats has not revealed a cause for the illnesses . <PARA> the complaints fda has received include adverse events involving different sizes , ages and breeds of dogs . about 60 percent of the reports are for gastrointestinal illness ( with or without elevated liver enzymes ) and about 30 percent relate to kidney or urinary signs . the remaining 10 percent of cases involve a variety of other signs , including <PARA> convulsions , tremors , hives , and skin irritation . <PARA> it is important to note that the reported illnesses are not limited to jerky treats made from chicken . we have received complaints about duck and sweet potato jerky treats and related products , such as jerky -

mortem information . when a person dies unexpectedly , it is not unusual for a medical examiner to perform an autopsy to try to determine the cause of death . when a pet dies , it is much less likely that qualified veterinary pathologists will have the opportunity to examine the body . by the time fda receives reports of deaths in pets , the body has often already been cremated or buried , eliminating the chance for scientists to gather more information about potential causes for the pet ’ s illness . <PARA> finally , fda does not have access to market data about food items for pets . fda regulations do not require product registration for foods , whether they are intended for people or animals . therefore , it is difficult to appreciate the scope of the jerky pet treat market and the different products available to consumers . <PARA> in human illness outbreaks caused by foodborne bacteria or contaminates , fda works in concert with the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) and state boards of health , which collect and track cases of foodborne illness . unfortunately , there is no equivalent for pets , which means that it is difficult to accurately evaluate the scope of an outbreak . <PARA> another complicating factor in the investigation is the lack of post -

lirn scientists might request specific testing to try to narrow down the cause of your pet ’ s illness . the costs of tests requested by the scientists will be covered by vet - lirn and fda , but pet owners will not be reimbursed for any additional testing expenses they may incur . <PARA> although it is always a difficult topic to consider , in the event of a pet death that appears to be related to the consumption of jerky pet treats , post - mortem testing of animal tissues , such as a necropsy ( in human medicine , doctors call this procedure an autopsy ) may also be helpful . while we want to do everything we can to prevent pets from becoming ill in the first place , having the chance to examine tissues may fill gaps in information that can help us pinpoint a cause for the reports of injury and death . <PARA> if you find it convenient to transfer pet food and treats to a secondary container to protect them from rodents , insects or spoilage , fda recommends that you consider saving the original packaging . this will help ensure that you will still have access to the lot code if your pet becomes ill from consuming the product . <PARA> while working with your veterinarian to review your pet ’ s records , fda and vet -

false	popular atlanta restaurant shut down ! <PARA> a popular asian / chinese restaurant bistro in atlanta was closed down this morning after authorities received a tip that the owner was accepting shipments of rats and mice from a vendor to prepare in his dishes . the owner and his wife were arrested early this morning and charges are not known at this time . after a full search of the kitchen , authorities found packaged rats , mice , kittens , puppies and a large frozen hawk . the restaurant is a popular gathering spot for local celebrities such as whitney houston and husband bobby brown , jermaine dupree , janet jackson , usher , monica , puffy , ti , ludacris , lil jon , toni braxton , tlc and others . the restaurant has locations off peachtree road and alpharetta near north pointe mall . <PARA> origins : these photographs supposedly documenting a chinese restaurant in atlanta that was shut down by health authorities after being found to have accepted delivery of “ packaged rats , mice , kittens , puppies and a large frozen hawk ” has been circulating on the internet since 2004 . while there certainly are parts of the world ( including china ) where one <PARA> can find restaurants serving fare made from animals not considered culinary items in the western world ( e . g ., pigeons , dogs , domestic cats , snakes , civet cats ), no such restaurant was found and closed down in the atlanta area in the 2004 timeframe for offering such unusual ( and illegal ) menu items . this rumor is just a hoax playing on familiar old urban legends about chinese restaurants in the u . s . offering up dishes made from animals such as cats and dogs to horrified americans . <PARA> the photographs displayed above were taken from a web site that sold snakes and feeding supplies , and they picture bags of frozen , shrink - wrapped rodents intended as food for snakes ( and other reptiles ) which pet owners can order online . such packages are not approved for sale in the u . s . as meat products intended for human consumption .	
false	origins : most americans naturally associate dwight david eisenhower ( commonly referred to as “ ike ”) with his two most prominent contributions to u . s . history : as the career army officer who <PARA> rose to become supreme commander of the allied expeditionary forces during world war ii and achieved the exalted rank of general of the army ( 5 stars ), and as the 34th president of the united states from 1953 to 1961 . but many people today are unaware of a post that ike held between the end of world war ii and his tenure in the white house : president of columbia university . eisenhower accepted an offer to become columbia ’ s president in 1948 and officially held the position until he was sworn in as president of the united states in january 1953 ( although he took leave from columbia after being appointed supreme allied commander of nato in 1950 ). <PARA> the notion of dwight d . eisenhower as the president of columbia university might seem a bit incongruous to contemporary americans because as a career military man , ike had no background in academia or any of the other spheres ( e . g ., law , business , the clergy ) from which a university such as columbia typically drew candidates for its presidency . however , his younger brother , milton stover eisenhower , did have a notable career in academia , serving as president of kansas state college , pennsylvania state university , and johns hopkins university . in that context , it ’ s not surprising a rumor postulating that someone at columbia had confused dwight eisenhower with one of his siblings might have begun and gained currency . <PARA> but , as robert a . mccaughey noted in his history of columbia university , there was little likelihood that anyone at columbia really wanted milton eisenhower for the president ’ s position in 1948 but mistakenly extended an offer to his brother dwight instead . at the time columbia ’ s trustees began considering candidates , milton was a college president of moderate prominence , while ike was perhaps the most famous and respected man in america : <PARA> one of the many apocryphal stories surrounding the selection of eisenhower has it that the trustees confused general eisenhower with his older [ sic ] brother , milton , who was in 1947 president of kansas state university ( and about to become president of pennsylvania state university ). a variant on this story had a trustee asking for suggestions from the university of chicago ’ s chancellor , robert m . hutchins , and being told to “ get eisenhower ,” hutchins meaning milton . <PARA> the frequent retelling of this story and even its adoption by ike himself do not make it credible . first , there is little reason to think that the columbia trustees would have been interested in milton , who only later achieved national academic prominence as the president of the johns hopkins university . but , second , there is every reason to believe that the columbia board was prepared to go to a very considerable distance to lure to morningside heights the most internationally admired american of his generation . 2 <PARA> the frequent retelling of this story and even its adoption by ike himself do not make it credible . first , there is little reason to think that the columbia trustees would have been interested in milton , who only later achieved national academic prominence as the president of the johns hopkins university . but , second , there is every reason to believe that the columbia board was prepared to go to a very considerable distance to lure to morningside heights the most internationally admired american of his generation . 2 <PARA> a confusion of milton with his brother is even less likely in light of that fact that dwight was first approached about the columbia presidency by thomas watson , the head of ibm , in 1946 , but eisenhower deferred accepting the position for well over a year . watson certainly knew the difference between dwight eisenhower and milton eisenhower , and a year was plenty enough time for any confusion of identities to have been rectified . <PARA> as suggested in the passage quoted above , the source of the eisenhower mix - up rumor was probably dwight himself , who insisted from the very beginning that his brother milton was far better suited for the columbia job than he was : <PARA> on april 2 , 1946 , eisenhower had spoken at the metropolitan museum of art , then stayed at the waldorf - astoria as tom watson ’ s guest . watson was a member of a columbia university trustees ’ committee searching for a president . watson asked eisenhower if he would consider taking the job . eisenhower ’ s instant reply was <PARA> that columbia had asked the wrong eisenhower — the the university should go after milton , who was an experienced educator . no , watson , said , columbia wanted the general . eisenhower said that he would not be available for nearly two years , and that he therefore could not consider the offer at that time . <PARA> thirteen months later , watson called on eisenhower . “ to my chagrin ,” eisenhower wrote milton , watson again offered the columbia position , urging “ the importance of the public service i could perform in that spot ” and painting “ the rosiest picture of what i would be offered in the way of conveniences , expenses , remuneration and so on .” eisenhower repeated that milton was the man columbia wanted ; watson repeated that columbia wanted the general and pressed for an answer . eisenhower resented the pressure and told milton that if watson forced him to make a quick answer , it would be “ no .” <PARA> eisenhower , who had made so many momentous decisions , found the process of making this one extremely painful . “ it was almost the first decision i ever had to make in my life that was directly concerned with myself ,” he [ said ]. in making it , he “ had to struggle against every instinct i had .” <PARA> on june 23 , 1947 , eisenhower wrote to columbia to indicate that if a formal offer were made to him , he would accept . 3 <PARA> that columbia had asked the wrong eisenhower — the the university should go after milton , who was an experienced educator . no , watson , said , columbia wanted the general . eisenhower said that he would not be available for nearly two years , and that he therefore could not consider the offer at that time . <PARA> thirteen months later , watson called on eisenhower . “ to my chagrin ,” eisenhower wrote milton , watson again offered the columbia position , urging “ the importance of the public service i could perform in that spot ” and painting “ the rosiest picture of what i would be offered in the way of conveniences , expenses , remuneration and so on .” eisenhower repeated that milton was the man columbia wanted ; watson repeated that columbia wanted the general and pressed for an answer . eisenhower resented the pressure and told milton that if watson forced him to make a quick answer , it would be “ no .” <PARA> eisenhower , who had made so many momentous decisions , found the process of making this one extremely painful . “ it was almost the first decision i ever had to make in my life that was directly concerned with myself ,” he [ said ]. in making it , he “ had to struggle against every instinct i had .” <PARA> on june 23 , 1947 , eisenhower wrote to columbia to indicate that if a formal offer were made to him , he would accept . 3 <PARA> a sub - legend related to eisenhower ’ s time at columbia holds that he was offered the university ’ s presidency so that he could be groomed for a run at the white house as a representative of the republican party . this rumor is also not true , according to eisenhower biographer stephen e . ambrose : <PARA> [ thomas ] watson argued that by accepting the position [ at columbia ], eisenhower could remove his name from political speculation , an idea that appealed to eisenhower mightily . it should be noted here that the popular impression that watson and the other wealthy republican trustees at columbia wanted eisenhower in order to begin grooming him for the presidency of the united states is altogether wrong . in november 1947 , watson “ exhortated ” eisenhower to “ have nothing to do with this political business ,” and in fact watson and most of the columbia trustees were dewey supporters who expected dewey to win in 1948 and then serve until 1956 . 3	
false	origins : red lobster is the ubiquitous casual dining restaurant chain operated by darden restaurants of orlando , florida , which boasts over seven hundred outlets worldwide , including ( in addition to the united states ) operations in canada , the united arab emirates , qatar and japan . <PARA> in september 2013 , the <PARA> darden restaurants corporation ( which also owns the olive garden , longhorn steakhouse , bahama breeze , capital grille and seasons 52 restaurant chains ) reported disappointing financial results , including a 37 . 6 % decrease in earnings per share and a $ 41 million drop in net earnings . a fair chunk of those disappointing financial results were attributed to the poor performance of the red lobster chain , which saw a 5 . 2 % decline in sales relative to the same quarter of the previous year , and a 3 . 8 % decline in same - restaurant traffic . <PARA> these results prompted darden , under pressure from investors , to announce in mid - december 2013 that they planned to separate themselves from the red lobster chain by selling it or spinning it off as a separate company : <PARA> under pressure from an activist hedge fund , darden announced that it would dispose of the chain that gave it life — red lobster — as one of several steps meant to bolster its stock price . <PARA> the company plans to shed red lobster through a tax -

colored hair opened the door . <PARA> “ hello ,” i said , “ i ’ m robert peterson . i missed your little girl today and wondered where she was .” <PARA> “ oh yes , mr . peterson , please come in . wendy spoke of you so much . i ’ m afraid i allowed her to bother you . if she was a nuisance , please , accept my apologies .” <PARA> “ not at all — she ’ s a delightful child .” i said , suddenly realizing that i meant what i had just said . <PARA> “ wendy died last week , mr . peterson . she had leukemia . maybe she didn ’ t tell you .” <PARA> struck dumb , i groped for a chair . i had to catch my breath . <PARA> “ she loved this beach so when she asked to come , we couldn ’ t say no . she seemed so much better here and had a lot of what she called happy days . but the last few weeks , she declined rapidly . . .” her voice faltered , “ she left something for you . . . if only i can find it . could you wait a moment while i look ?” <PARA> i nodded stupidly , my mind racing for something to say to this lovely young woman . she handed me a smeared envelope with “ mr . p ” printed in bold childish letters . inside was a drawing in bright crayon hues — a yellow beach , a blue sea , and a brown bird . underneath was carefully printed : a sandpiper to bring you joy . <PARA> tears welled up in my eyes and a heart that had almost forgotten to love opened wide . <PARA> i took wendy ’ s mother in my arms . “ i ’ m so sorry , i ’ m so sorry , i ’ m so sorry ,” i muttered over and over , and we wept together . the precious little picture is framed now and hangs in my study . six words — one for each year of her life — that speak to me of harmony , courage , and undemanding love . a gift from a child with sea blue eyes and hair the color of sand — who taught me the gift of love . <PARA> origins : the story about a dying girl who leaves a drawing of a sandpiper for the grouch she ’ s befriended has been circulating on the internet since 1997 . three different beach - walking grumps have been named as the one relating the account : ruth patterson , ruth peterson , and robert peterson . <PARA> in 2003 this sad tale , which had previously ended with “ a gift from a child with sea blue eyes and hair the color of sand — who taught me the gift of love ,” appeared with this coda tacked onto it : <PARA> note : this is a true story sent out by robert peterson . it happened over 20 years ago and the incident changed his life forever . it serves as a reminder to all of us that we need to take time to enjoy living and life and each other . the price of hating other human beings is loving oneself less . life is so complicated , the hustle and bustle of everyday traumas can make us lose focus about what is truly important or what is only a momentary setback or crisis . this week , be sure to give your loved ones an extra hug , and by all means , take a moment ... even if it is only ten seconds , to stop and smell the roses . this comes from someone ’ s heart , and is shared with many and now i share it with you . <PARA> there is no robert peterson . the actual author of the piece is mary sherman hilbert . the full - length version of hilbert ’ s story appeared in 1978 in a periodical produced by a religious order in canada and was subsequently picked up by reader ’ s digest and offered in condensed form to its readership in 1980 . in that shortened version , which went on to become the widely - forwarded piece now part of online culture , the beach walker is identified as ruth peterson and the child as windy . <PARA> the reader ’ s digest version is prefaced by the following author ’ s statement , one anyone seriously weighing the question of “ is it true ?” should pay close attention to : <PARA> several years ago , a neighbor related to me an experience that had happened to her one winter on a beach in washington state . the incident stuck in my mind and i took notes on what she said . later , at a writer ’ s conference , the conversation came back to me , and i felt i had to set it down . here is her story , as haunting to me now as when i first heard it . <PARA> it needs to be noted that although the sandpiper tale is written in the first person , its author was not the one who had the encounter with the child ; she is merely repeating a story she heard years earlier . <PARA> the sandpiper tale attempts to impart two lessons . first , it <PARA> instructs us not to let our own grief and suffering blind us to the travails of others . it does so through showing us what happened to someone who let his own funk impel him to act in an impatient manner with someone whose dire reality was unknown to him , leaving us to see how he was forever afterwards haunted by memories of his unthinking unkindness . second , it uses the power of narrative to advise that even in the face of unfolding personal horror we should strive for all the “ happy days ” we can , as wendy did . <PARA> barbara “ last time a sandpiper inspired this much emotional response , it starred elizabeth taylor ” mikkelson

unproven	origins : this image of a distraught toddler presumably being forced to undergo a tattooing at the hands of his father was circulated widely via social media in april 2014 , prompting numerous outraged comments about parental irresponsibility and abuse . whether the image is actually a photograph that captures a genuine case of what it depicts is <PARA> currently unknown , however . <PARA> image searches on the internet show this same picture has been posted to numerous web sites over the last several years , typically categorized as an example of “ bad parenting ” or a “ parenting fail .” however , the origins of the photograph remain uncertain , as does whether the picture truly shows what viewers assume of it , or whether it was a staged or digitally manipulated photo . <PARA> cases of parents and other supposedly responsible adults taking it upon themselves to have children tattooed are certainly not unknown , though . in 2009 , a 26 - year - old georgia man gave his 3 - year - old son a shoulder tattoo that said “ db ” ( short for “ daddy ’ s boy ”) and was later fined $ 300 and sentenced to 12 months of probation , and in december 2013 a 20 - year - old man tattooed two under - 13 girls left in his charge with a home tattoo kit ( and the girls ’ mother and her boyfriend then compounded the issue by attempting to use a heated razor blade to scrape off the tattoos ).	
true	origins : one attribute we here at snopes . com have in common with advice columnists is that we both receive a fair amount of rather bizarre mail — most of it sent in earnest , but some of it sent by pranksters trying to see if they can trick someone into publishing their bits of inventive fiction . we probably have a bit of an advantage over the advice columnists in that the false and the apocryphal are as much our stock in trade as the true and genuine — we deal with the kinds of things people believe to be true ; whether or not folkloric tales are actually true is usually irrelevant . columnists , on the other hand , generally prefer not to be doling out advice to readers seeking <PARA> answers to phony , contrived problems . <PARA> the bogus biographical bug bit advice columnist “ dear abby ” in march 2004 , when universal press syndicate pulled her upcoming 15 march column after a newspaper editor who read it in advance noticed that one of the letters she had answered sounded a bit too . . . familiar . <PARA> ( despite universal press syndicate ’ s having rescinded the column , a few newspapers chose to run it anyway .) <PARA> in a column titled “ wife meets perfect match after husband strikes out ,” abby proffered advice to a woman who signed her letter “ stuck in a love triangle .” mrs . “ stuck ” described herself as a 34 - year - old woman with three children who had been married for 10 years to gene , her “ greedy , selfish , inconsiderate and rude ” husband . so inconsiderate was gene that his birthday present to his wife was a bowling ball — one drilled to fit his own fingers , with his name embossed on it ( and presented , of course , to a woman who didn ’ t even know how to bowl ). <PARA> but “ stuck ” decided to spite her selfish husband by keeping the ball and learning how to bowl , leading to her meeting franco — a man <PARA> who was “ kind , considerate and loving ” — at the local lanes . one thing led to another , they fell in love , and franco proposed , putting “ stuck ” in a quandary : “ i no longer love gene . i want to divorce him and marry franco . at the same time , i ’ m worried that gene won ’ t be able to move on with his life . i also think our kids would be devastated . what should i do ?” <PARA> abby ’ s solution was for “ stuck ” to admit her infidelity to her husband : “ to save the marriage , he might be willing to change back to the man who bowled you over in the first place .” <PARA> “ stuck ”‘ s dilemma may sound so familiar to some readers — it was taken directly from the plot of a first - season episode of the animated tv series the simpsons (“ life on the fast lane ,” also known as “ jacques to be wild ,” first aired 18 march 1990 ), synopsized by tv guide thusly : “ homer ’ s birthday present ‘ for marge ’ is a bowling ball , prompting marge to teach him a lesson by taking up the sport — and maybe also a handsome instructor .” <PARA> this wasn ’ t the first time a prominent advice columnist had been tripped up with a recycled plot . in 1994 , a mischievous reader ( all right , i ’ ll confess — it was me ) sent abby ’ s sister , ann landers , a letter based upon a well traveled urban legend to see if she ’ d fall for it . she did , printing and answering the letter in her 1 may column .

unproven	origins : the <PARA> power of the enigma lies in its ability to enthrall , to capture the imagination . as a society , we delight in the little mysteries that don ’ t immediately yield up their <PARA> answers , which is why products whose names we can ’ t fathom hold their appeal . <PARA> one such product is 7up . though the soft drink itself is not the least bit mysterious , its name is . to this day , no one can swear to know the reason for that particular choice of moniker . <PARA> here is what is known : 7up was invented in october 1929 by charles leiper grigg , a man who ten years earlier had formulated a carbonated orange - flavored drink (“ whistle ”) <PARA> while working for an employer with whom he later had a falling out . said contretemps led to his packing up and leaving , and in 1920 the employerless grigg formed his own soft drink company , the howdy corporation to produce “ howdy ,” yet another orange - flavored soda . <PARA> howdy was fairly successful as soft drinks go , but it was unable to seriously challenge orange crush , the leader in the field , and over time howdy lost market share <PARA> to its predominant rival . rather than see his company die by inches , c . l . grigg cast about for another sort of soda to broaden his company ’ s consumer base . <PARA> grigg discarded colas , root beers , and ginger ales in favor of a lemon - lime concoction . although most every bottler was producing a lemon - lime drink in those <PARA> days , none of those sodas had achieved national prominence , a state of affairs that left a golden opportunity forlornly sitting there waiting to be noticed . <PARA> and grigg noticed . in response , he invented the soda we now call 7up . <PARA> however , the uncola wasn ’ t known as 7up for the first few years of its existence . it was originally christened “ bib - label lithiated lemon - lime soda .” in his formulation , grigg had included lithia , a naturally - occurring substance found in minute quantities in bubbling waters fed by underground springs . ( lithia is better known as lithium , a drug used to even out mood swings .) grigg had the notion that the chemical ’ s presumed healthful aspects would be a selling point with the soda - buying public , hence the “ lithiated ” in the name . as for “ bib - label ,” it was howdy corporation ’ s intent to use paper labels of the sort that could be dropped over the necks of otherwise unlabeled bottles . <PARA> fortunately , the unwieldy name was soon morphed to “ 7up lithiated lemon soda ,” and in 1936 the soda was officially re - dubbed “ 7up .” that same year , the howdy corporation became the seven - up company . <PARA> as to why “ 7up ,” c . l . grigg never explained how he came up with the cryptic name . several theories exist about its origin : <PARA> ( which it was . then again , so was orange crush .) <PARA> it ’ s quite possible the drink ’ s name was meant to be a enigma , given that its creator never publicly explained it . it could even have been a nonsense term meant to leave people wondering after its backstory as a way of generating interest in the beverage . ( we humans do love mysteries , after all .) <PARA> questions of how it came by its name aside , 7up has attracted another origin rumor . many trivia lists circulated on the internet make the following claim : <PARA> the ‘ spot ’ on 7up comes from its inventor who had red eyes . he was albino . <PARA> charles leiper grigg wasn ’ t an <PARA> albino . in photographs ( albeit black and white ones ), <PARA> he appears normally pigmented , and we ’ ve yet to encounter a biography of him that makes any mention of his displaying traits of albinism . ( by the way , though it is <PARA> possible for an albino to have reddish or violet eyes , most people with that condition have blue eyes , and some have hazel or brown eyes .) <PARA> as to where the red dot in the beverage ’ s logo came from , so far the earliest examples we ’ ve found of that design have come from the 1970s . prior to that , the company ’ s trademark for the longest time was a black - outlined white “ 7up ” on a red background that bore some white bubbles — the red dot was nowhere to be seen . in very early ads , the “ 7up ” had wings . <PARA> barbara “ 7upswept ” mikkelson	
false	origins : this rumor concerning michael jackson ’ s phone number started in early 1984 , when the singer was at the height of his popularity , riding the crest of the thriller album ’ s tidal wave of sales . according to the rumor , the first seven digits of the album ’ s upc were michael jackson ’ s phone number . ( why in the world the notoriously reclusive pop star would <PARA> choose to broadcast his private phone number to millions of record buyers was a thought that didn ’ t faze those who believed in such things .) <PARA> would - be callers were left to divine the area code by themselves , and many of them did : using their local area code , the area code for encino , california ( where jackson <PARA> lived ), or the toll - free ‘ 800 ’ area code . callers who opted for the ‘ 800 ’ area code somehow got through to the residence of a woman named barbara brown in youngstown , ohio , who started receiving upwards of a dozen calls a day after jackson won eight grammy awards in february . nearly everyone in the usa <PARA> who had the same seven - digit phone number ( in different area codes ) received calls asking for michael jackson ; the bellevue hair studio in bellevue , washington , reportedly fielded fifty phone calls per day at the rumor ’ s height . ( just a few years earlier , tommy tutone ’ s song “ jenny ( 867 - 5309 )” had driven to distraction phone customers with that number as well .) <PARA> exactly how the rumor began is unknown , outside of the general public ’ s fascination for finding hidden meanings in album covers and upc markings . some reports claimed the rumor was being spread by mtv , but mtv ’ s public relations manager stated that the network had never broadcast any such information . although this rumor ’ s specific origins are unknown , the choice of the mysterious michael jackson as its subject was certainly easy to understand .	
unproven	origins : with two exceptions , since 1840 , u . s . presidents who have been elected in years ending in zero have been killed or have died of natural causes while in office . and one exception literally came within an inch of death . <PARA> it ’ s hard to know what to make of such a sequence , but folks have certainly tried over the years . such a string of presidential mortality is deemed too improbable to have occurred naturally , giving rise to rumors about a fatal indian curse among those unwilling to recognize that chaos sometimes takes the form of coincidence . randomness is disquieting ; indian curses are , in comparison , the lesser of the evils because they at least support the illusion that there is order in our universe . in this odd way , belief in predestined fatalities is comforting . <PARA> william henry harrison , who was elected in 1840 , died of pneumonia at the age of 68 , exactly one month after his inauguration . <PARA> abraham lincoln , first elected in 1860 , was assassinated by john wilkes booth just after embarking on his second term in office in 1865 . <PARA> james a . garfield won the 1880 election . he was shot in the back in a washington railroad station waiting room in july 1881 and died of his wounds in september 1881 . <PARA> william mckinley was re - elected in 1900 . in september 1901 , after giving a speech at an exposition in buffalo , he was shot while shaking hands <PARA> with wellwishers . mckinley died of his wounds a little more than a week later . <PARA> warren g . harding , elected in 1920 , expired of a stroke or heart attack in 1923 . it was long rumored his wife had poisoned him . <PARA> franklin d . roosevelt , re - elected in 1940 for a third term , suffered a massive cerebral hemorrhage and died just after having started an unprecedented fourth term in 1945 . <PARA> john f . kennedy was elected in 1960 and assassinated by lee harvey oswald in 1963 . <PARA> ronald reagan was elected in 1980 but managed to cheat the grim reaper by a matter of an inch , the distance by which would - be assassin john hinckley ’ s bullet missed his heart in 1981 . <PARA> maybe reagan also broke the “ every 20 years ” curse . or maybe it ’ s just sleeping . <PARA> those who look to make sense of eerie coincidences have come up with an explanation to account for this string of deaths : an ancient indian curse , supposedly administered by tecumseh himself after suffering defeat at the hands in william henry harrison at the battle of tippecanoe in 1811 . ( tecumseh died in the 1813 battle of the thames , again fighting troops led by harrison .) according to lore , the famed indian chief cursed the great white fathers . no explanation is given for why the chief ’ s curse would only affect one presidency in five , but one cannot , after all , expect the fanciful to cover everything . <PARA> another version attributes the curse to tenskwatawa ( also known as “ the prophet ”), a shawnee medicine man who was half - brother to tecumseh . the hex was supposedly his revenge for the death of his half - sibling . <PARA> “ harrison will die i tell you ,” the prophet reportedly said . “ and after him , every great chief chosen every 20 years thereafter will die . and when each one dies , let everyone remember the death of my people .” <PARA> stirring words indeed , but there ’ s no reason to suppose they were actually uttered . no record of either tecumseh or tenskwatawa laying a whammy on american presidents has yet surfaced — it ’ s all undocumented folktale at this point and is as likely just someone ’ s imaginative backstory to the inexplicable as it is anything else . <PARA> folks have been taking note of this string of presidential deaths for quite some time — it ’ s not a new snippet of spooky information recently dropped into the lap of the american people . a ripley ’ s believe it or not book published in 1934 noted the coincidental twenty - year pattern of presidential deaths between 1840 and 1920 , with question marks in place of a name for the upcoming 1940 entry indicating the presumption of a continuing pattern . the pattern did , of course , hold true again when franklin roosevelt , who had been re - elected in 1940 , filled in that blank by dying in office in 1945 . <PARA> as to what to make of the “ curse ,” it ’ s interesting to note that since 1840 , only one president other than those supposedly felled by this ill - wishing has died in office : zachary taylor , who was elected in 1848 and died in 1850 of a stomach ailment . ( taylor ’ s body was exhumed in 1991 to investigate a theory that he had been poisoned with arsenic , but the results were negative ). also interesting is the notion that the curse is a prescient one , as two presidents who won elections in years ending in ‘ 0 ’ — lincoln and roosevelt — did not die until after beginning subsequent terms in office . apparently the curse foresaw re - election for both of them . <PARA> the key to all this presidential demising possibly lies more within the realm of the stars than the rumored words of a dead indian chief . or at least so the astrologers would have us believe . according to mark dodich , an astrologer who has attempted to analyze the curse of tecumseh , the reason behind this force is one of “ cosmic coincidence ,” not native american hexing . dodich claims the curse ’ s effects overlap with the alignment of jupiter and saturn , whose orbits have lined up every twenty years . <PARA> one of the two 20 - year pattern ’ s failures — president ronald reagan — is explained by the sign the alignment of these two planets occurred under . alignments under the earth signs ( taurus , capricorn , and virgo ) have led to dead presidents , but reagan ’ s term occurred under an air sign , accounting for his survival . <PARA> according to dodich , year 2000 ’ s jupiter - saturn twinning once again occurred under the earth sign of taurus , a phenomenon he says won ’ t happen again for another 600 years . it thus marks the end of a deadly cycle , but if dodich was right about this curse thing , it would have sound the death knell for another president first . however , george w . bush , the president elected in the supposed “ curse ” year of 2000 , finished out two terms in good health . <PARA> barbara “ reagan : air force won ” mikkelson

free . and although most bank customers are aware their deposits are insured , they aren ’ t necessarily familiar with the details of how that insurance works , a circumstance that has fostered the spread of rumors which create additional insecurity . <PARA> after a wave of bank failures that came in the wake of the stock market crash of 1929 and the prolonged economic depression that followed , the u . s . federal government created the federal deposit insurance corporation ( fdic ) to restore public confidence in ( and help stabilize ) the u . s . banking system . the fdic provided federal government guarantees of deposits up to $ 100 , 000 per account holder per bank ( and up to $ 250 , 000 per account holder for deposit retirement accounts ), subject to certain conditions , at insured financial institutions .* <PARA> bank failures in the u . s . have been a relatively uncommon phenomenon since the savings - and - loan crisis of the late 1980s , so many consumers have had little or no exposure to the process by which fdic deposit insurance works , a circumstance that has led to the uncertainty reflected in the examples cited above . widely - believed rumors hold that fdic insurance actually covers just a small fraction of the original deposit amount ( e . g ., 1 . 5 %), or that the fdic only reimburses depositors in full over a very long period of time ( e . g ., 99 years ), the net result being the mistaken belief that fdic insurance isn ’ t really much of a guarantee at all . <PARA> in fact , these rumors are so prevalent that they were both included ( as numbers # 3 and # 4 ) in a list of the top ten misconceptions about the fdic published in the spring 2006 edition of the fdic consumer news newsletter , where they were addressed thusly : <PARA> if a bank fails , the fdic could take up to 99 years to pay depositors for their insured accounts . <PARA> this is a completely false notion that many bank customers have told us they heard from someone attempting to sell them another kind of financial product . <PARA> the truth is that federal law requires the fdic to pay the insured deposits “ as soon as possible ” after an insured bank fails . <PARA> historically , the fdic pays insured deposits within a few days after a bank closes , usually the next business day . in most cases , the fdic will provide each depositor with a new account at another insured bank . or , if arrangements cannot be made with another institution , the fdic will issue a check to each depositor . <PARA> the fdic only pays failed -

mixture	interesting perspective . <PARA> please read this and pass it on — it could save your life !! <PARA> * * * * extract from doug copp ’ s article on the “ triangle of life ”, edited by larry linn for maa safety committee brief on 4 / 13 / 04 . <PARA> my name is doug copp . i am the rescue chief and disaster manager of the american rescue team international ( arti ), the world ’ s most experienced rescue team . the information in this article will save lives in an earthquake . <PARA> i have crawled inside 875 collapsed buildings , worked with rescue teams from 60 countries , founded rescue teams in several countries , and i am a member of many rescue teams from many countries . i was the united nations expert in disaster mitigation ( unx051 – unienet ) for two years . i have worked at every major disaster in the world since 1985 , except for simultaneous disasters . <PARA> in 1996 we made a film which proved my survival methodology to be correct . the turkish federal government , city of istanbul , university of istanbul , case productions and arti cooperated to film this practical , scientific test . we collapsed a school and a home with 20 mannequins inside . ten mannequins did “ duck and cover ,” and ten mannequins i used in my “ triangle of life ” survival method . after the simulated earthquake collapse we crawled through the rubble and entered the building to film and <PARA> document the results . the film , in which i practiced my survival techniques under directly observable , scientific conditions , relevant to building collapse , showed there would have been zero percent survival for those doing duck and cover . there would likely have been 100 percent survivability for people using my method of the “ triangle of life .” this film has been seen by millions of viewers on television in turkey and the rest of europe , and it was seen in the usa , canada and latin america on the tv program real tv . <PARA> the first building i ever crawled inside of was a school in mexico city during the 1985 earthquake . every child was under their desk . every child was crushed to the thickness of their bones . they could have survived by lying down next to their desks in the aisles . it was obscene , unnecessary and i wondered why the children were not in the aisles . i didn ’ t at the time know that the children were told to hide under something . <PARA> simply stated , when buildings collapse , the weight of the ceilings falling upon the objects or furniture inside crushes these objects , leaving a space or void next to them . this space is what i call the “ triangle of life ”. the larger the object , the stronger , the less it will compact . the less the object compacts , the larger the void , the greater the probability that the person who is using this void for safety will not be injured . the next time you watch collapsed buildings , on television , count the “ triangles ” you see formed . they are everywhere . it is the most common shape , you will see , in a collapsed building . they are everywhere . i trained the fire department of trujillo ( population 750 , 000 ) in how to survive , take care of their families , and to rescue others in earthquakes . <PARA> the chief of rescue in the trujillo fire department is a professor at trujillo university . he accompanied me everywhere . he gave personal testimony : “ my name is roberto rosales . i am chief of rescue in trujillo . when i was 11 years old , i was trapped inside of a collapsed building . my entrapment occurred during the earthquake of 1972 that killed 70 , 000 people . i survived in the “ triangle of life ” that existed next to my brother ’ s motorcycle . my friends who got under the bed and under desks were crushed to death [ he gives more details , names , addresses etc .]... i am the living example of the “ triangle of life ”. my dead friends are the example of “ duck and cover ”. <PARA> tips doug copp provides : <PARA> 1 ) everyone who simply “ ducks and covers ” when buildings collapse is crushed to death — every time , without exception . people who get under objects , like desks or cars , are always crushed . <PARA> 2 ) cats , dogs and babies all naturally often curl up in the fetal position . you should too in an earthquake . it is a natural safety / survival instinct . you can survive in a smaller void . get next to an object , next to a sofa , next to a large bulky object that will compress slightly but leave a void next to it . <PARA> 3 ) wooden buildings are the safest type of construction to be in during an earthquake . the reason is simple : the wood is flexible and moves with the force of the earthquake . if the wooden building does collapse , large survival voids are created . also , the wooden building has less concentrated , crushing weight . brick buildings will break into individual bricks . bricks will cause many injuries but less squashed bodies than concrete slabs . <PARA> 4 ) if you are in bed during the night and an earthquake occurs , simply roll off the bed . a safe void will exist around the bed . hotels can achieve a much greater survival rate in earthquakes , simply by posting a sign on the back of the door of every room , telling occupants to lie down on the floor , next to the bottom of the bed during an earthquake . <PARA> 5 ) if an earthquake happens while you are watching television and you cannot easily escape by getting out the door or window , then lie down and curl up in the fetal position <PARA> next to a sofa , or large chair . <PARA> 6 ) everybody who gets under a doorway when buildings collapse is killed . how ? if you stand under a doorway and the doorjamb falls forward or backward you will be crushed by the ceiling above . if the door jam falls sideways you will be cut in half by the doorway . in either case , you will be killed ! <PARA> 7 ) never go to the stairs . the stairs have a different “ moment of frequency ” ( they swing separately from the main part of the building ). the stairs and remainder of the building continuously bump into each other until structural failure of the stairs takes place . the people who get on stairs before they fail are chopped up by the stair treads . they are horribly mutilated . even if the building doesn ’ t collapse , stay away from the stairs . the stairs are a likely part of the building to be damaged . even if the stairs are not collapsed by the earthquake , they may collapse later when overloaded by screaming , fleeing people . they should always be checked for safety , even when the rest of the building is not damaged . <PARA> 8 ) get near the outer walls of buildings or outside of them if possible – it is much better to be near the outside of the building rather than the interior . the farther inside you are from the outside perimeter of the building the greater the probability that your escape route will be blocked ; <PARA> 9 ) people inside of their vehicles are crushed when the road above falls in an earthquake and crushes their vehicles ; which is exactly what happened with the slabs between the decks of the nimitz freeway . the victims of the san francisco earthquake all stayed inside of their vehicles . they were all killed . they could have easily survived by getting out and sitting or lying next to their vehicles , says the author . everyone killed would have survived if they had been able to get out of their cars and sit or lie next to them . all the crushed cars had voids 3 feet high next to them , except for the cars that had columns fall directly across them . <PARA> 10 ) i discovered , while crawling inside of collapsed newspaper offices and other offices with a lot of paper , that paper does not compact . large voids are found surrounding stacks of paper . <PARA> origins : we can ’ t say that every single point mentioned in the above article about earthquake safety by controversial “ rescue expert ” doug copp is wrong or bad advice , but there are some pretty substantial reasons why readers might want to take the article ( particularly its advice that everyone who uses the “ duck and cover ” technique in an earthquake ends up crushed to death ) with some very large grains of salt . <PARA> 1 ) disaster preparedness experts with groups such as the american red cross have disputed that findings based on earthquake experiences in other countries ( e . g ., turkey ) are applicable to earthquake situations that might occur in the united states , where building codes are substantially different : <PARA> we at the american red cross have studied the research on the topic of earthquake safety for many years . we have benefited from extensive research done by the california office of emergency services , california seismic safety commission , professional and academic research organizations , and emergency management agencies , who have also studied the recommendation to “ drop , cover , and hold on !” during the shaking of an earthquake . personally , i have also benefited from those who preceded me in doing earthquake education in california since the field act was passed in 1933 . <PARA> what the claims made by mr . copp of arti , inc ., does not seem to distinguish is that the recommendation to “ drop , cover , and hold on !” is a u . s .- based recommendation based on u . s . building codes and construction standards . much research in the united states has confirmed that “ drop , cover , and hold on !” has saved lives in the united states . engineering researchers have demonstrated that very few buildings collapse or “ pancake ” in the u . s . as they might do in other countries . using a web site to show one picture of one u . s . building that had a partial collapse after a major quake in an area with thousands of buildings that did not collapse during the same quake is inappropriate and misleading . <PARA> what the claims made by mr . copp of arti , inc

been criticized by other disaster preparedness experts , who have noted that the event on which the article was based was a rescue exercise and not an experiment which simulated an earthquake : <PARA> copp likes to base his evidence on the turkish “ experiment ” that he was involved with . unfortunately , unbeknownst to all involved , this was not an experiment at all , but rather a voluntary organization ’ s search and rescue exercise . my colleagues in turkey corroborate that a building scheduled for demolition was used as a search and rescue training opportunity . they did decide to put mannequins in different spots to see what would happen . and indeed they reported finding mannequins unharmed next to large and heavy objects . <PARA> what is the problem with this ? simply this : to collapse the building , they rammed the columns , causing the building to pancake . they did not simulate an earthquake . earthquakes come in waves . they cause lateral shaking . they cause a variety of different kinds of damage . since this experiment didn ’ t produce anything resembling shaking it really doesn ’ t tell us anything at all about what would happen during an earthquake . <PARA> what

supposedly sustained there ) has been challenged in a series of articles published in the albuquerque journal which described him as a self - serving opportunist rather than a true rescue expert , reporting that : <PARA> self - proclaimed rescue guru doug copp ’ s mission to ground zero was considered so important that he had clearance to be flown to new york even though all civilian air traffic in the united states had been grounded . once there , he says he assumed a pivotal role and sustained devastating injuries while wading through the “ toxic soup ” in search of survivors and victims , and was awarded nearly $ 650 , 000 for his injuries . but there is little evidence copp performed real rescue work , and it is doubtful that he deserves compensation . <PARA> doug copp was awarded $ 649 , 000 , tax free , from the fund set up to compensate victims of 9 / 11 . he says it ’ s not enough . but it ’ s doubtful he deserves anything . a journal investigation found little evidence that copp did real rescue work in new york . his forays into the rubble were to shoot video , some of which he tried to sell . his claim of seeking medical care within the time frame appears false . all typical of copp ’ s years as a self - proclaimed rescue guru . <PARA> no one who worked with copp said he did real rescue work in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks . instead , they said , he took videotape at the site , tried to get on tv , hung around a hotel and promoted himself . <PARA> everyone who went to new york with copp disputed his claims about what he did there . <PARA> doctors questioned copp ’ s claims that he is seriously and terminally ill . <PARA> the doctor copp says he sought care from within the fund ’ s time requirement said the encounter never

mixture	origins : in the modern era , with our multiple broadcast television networks , hundreds of cable stations , and other premium channels , there is little left that can ’ t be ( or hasn ’ t been ) seen on television in one form or another . but we older folks ( i . e ., those of us who grew up during the 1970s or earlier ) can still recall and ponder how remarkable it was that for decades , many common aspects of ordinary life were not glimpsed on prime - time <PARA> television : pregnant women , bathrooms , married couples sleeping in the same bed together , ladies ’ navels and the like simply weren ’ t recorded on camera , or if they were , network standards and practices groups insisted they be excised before broadcast . so squeamish were networks about such matters that in 1960 tonight show host jack paar famously quit the program ( albeit temporarily ), incensed that nbc had cut one of his jokes merely because it referenced the abbreviation “ w . c .” ( i . e ., “ water closet ,” a term referring to a room with a flush toilet ). even as late as the mid - 1970s , the six kids in the brady bunch ( which ran from 1969 to 1974 ) all shared a single bathroom that didn ’ t even contain a toilet , and audiences chortled with glee when all in the family episodes from that same era included the mere sound of a toilet ’ s being flushed off - stage in an unseen bathroom . <PARA> it ’ s therefore surprising to many people that one of the many ubiquitous trivia items circulated on the internet is the amazing but true “ fact ” ( or so we ’ re told ) that the very first network television program to show a toilet was the popular , gentle <PARA> family sitcom leave it to beaver , which began its original network run in 1957 . thus this bit of leave it to beaver trivia , if true , brings several questions to mind : why was it that well into the 1970s the networks were so circumspect about letting viewers glimpse an actual toilet if one had already been shown on leave it to beaver , a series that had aired way back in the 1950s ? and if network practices and / or fcc restrictions prevented the airing of scenes showing toilets in prime - time programs back then , how did leave it to beaver manage to get around that restriction ? <PARA> the answer to both those questions is that leave it to beaver didn ’ t actually show a toilet in any of its episodes , although there is a kernel of truth to the claim that it did . <PARA> back in october 1957 , the intended debut episode of leave it to beaver , entitled “ captain jack ,” had to be shelved for a week while another episode aired in its place due to problems with cbs ’ standards and practices group . the network ’ s sticking point with “ captain jack ” was that the plot of the episode had wally and the beaver ordering a <PARA> “ genuine florida alligator ” for $ 2 . 50 from an advertisement published in their robot men of mars comic book , then being disappointed at receiving not a full - grown saurian but an eight - inch baby gator . determined to keep their purchase anyway , the boys visited the proprietor of the eponymous captain jack ’ s alligator farm , who gave them some pointers on the proper care and feeding of an alligator . wally and beaver couldn ’ t keep their reptilian pet ( now christened captain jack ) in their bedroom for fear their parents would find it , so they hid him in the bathroom . but merely keeping captain jack in the sink or the bathtub would have left him too vulnerable to discovery , so they concealed him by placing him inside the toilet tank ( which wally referred to as captain jack ’ s “ aquarium ”). <PARA> therein lay the problem . in 1957 the networks were loath about displaying a bathroom on television , let alone an actual toilet , and the “ captain jack ” episode as filmed required the showing of both . cbs refused to approve the episode in its original form , but it couldn ’ t reasonably be redone with the bathroom scenes omitted since there was nowhere else in the house the boys could plausibly hide an alligator . after several rounds of wrangling between the network and the production company , a compromise was reached : the episode could include shots of a toilet tank , but not the toilet itself . so , in one very brief scene , viewers saw the boys feeding their baby alligator in the middle of the bathroom floor , whereupon wally walked over to the toilet tank , put captain jack inside it , and placed the lid back on the tank . the toilet itself was never seen , only the very top portion of its tank : <PARA> was leave it to beaver the first prime - time network program to show a toilet ? not quite . it can lay claim to being the first series to show a toilet tank , however , and to be among the earliest programs to show a bathroom in any form . <PARA> series star jerry mathers discussed the controversy over the “ captain jack ” episode during a 2014 interview with fox news :

false	while there certainly exist words that began their linguistic lives as people ’ s names , hello does not belong in that category . this sorry tale about the surname of alexander graham bell ’ s girlfriend is merely a hoax , nothing more . <PARA> we began seeing this purported etymology for hello in the online world in november 2010 . iterations of this leg - pull have subsequently rechristened the inventor of the telephone “ graham bell ” and “ graham - bell ” ( with one version also claiming “ his first 2 instruments were at his and her place ... and the first call he made to commercially test the phones was to his girlfriend !”) <PARA> alexander graham bell ( 1847 - 1922 ) invented the telephone in 1876 . the first successful call was to his assistant ( who was in the adjoining room ): “ mr . watson — come here — i want to see you .” <PARA> as for that first call , or any other by graham , being made to the “ margaret hello ” identified in this tall tale as “ his girlfriend ,” such would have stood as rather interesting personal news to those who knew him , because in 1876 bell was engaged to mabel hubbard , a woman whom he married the following year and who remained his wife until his death in 1922 . by december 2016 , the tale graduated to meme form ; the image of bell with the purported “ margaret hello ” was in fact a photograph of the inventor and hubbard . <PARA> hello is an alteration of hallo , which itself is an alteration of holla and hollo , which were shouts used to attract attention , in the manner one would use yoo - hoo !, hey there ! and hey waiter ! today . the earliest forms of this exclamation appear to date to least 1400 . hullo ( the british version of hello ), was recorded in print in 1803 , but as a shout to garner attention , not as a greeting . <PARA> the use of hello we ’ re most familiar with ( as a greeting in the manner of good morning , heya , or wazzup ), was around twenty years before bell was born . according to the oxford english dictionary ( oed ), its oldest known print usage dates to 1827 , when it appeared thusly in the u . s . telegraph : <PARA> by 1834 , the greeting was also being used as a verb , as this oed entry demonstrates : <PARA> as for what form of greeting bell advocated for telephone calls , various sources assert he favored ahoy . it was instead thomas edison who championed the use of hello .

false	origins : in december 2010 , a facebook - based hoax that had previously circulated in august 2010 was revived and put to a more nefarious purpose : in its new guise , the hoax attempted to trick the unwary and overly curious into handing over access to their facebook information ( and control of what got posted on their facebook pages ) to scam artists intent upon making a quick buck . <PARA> the lure was a purported devastating message a father had left on his daughter ’ s facebook wall , a message which prompted her to commit suicide . sometimes the story was fleshed out with <PARA> claims that the girl had taken her life on christmas eve , or that she ’ d just returned from basketball tryouts when she read the horrifying missive . it was typically accompanied by a photograph of a rather fetching girl in a pink top looking back over her shoulder and smiling , or a headshot of some other pretty girl . <PARA> the lure circulated as a facebook post and as an e - mail , both of which contained a link ( which we ’ ve elided from the example above ) to an application claiming to send those who launch it to a site where they could view the heartbreaking message left by the father of the deceased girl . that link led to a facebook “ request for permission ” page which asked visitors to provide permission for the following ( the link to the app and the name of the app itself were constantly being changed by the scam artists running the con , so with that in mind , in the following example we ’ ve used “ name of app ” in place of the ever - changing moniker ): <PARA> “ name of app ” is requesting permission to do the following : <PARA> access my basic information <PARA> includes name , profile picture , gender , networks , user id , list of friends , and any other information i ’ ve shared with everyone . <PARA> post to my wall <PARA> “ name of app ” may post status messages , notes , photos , and videos to my wall <PARA> access my data any time <PARA> “ name of app ” may access my data when i ’ m not using the application <PARA> access my basic information <PARA> includes name , profile picture , gender , networks , user id , list of friends , and any other information i ’ ve shared with everyone . <PARA> post to my wall <PARA> “ name of app ” may post status messages , notes , photos , and videos to my wall <PARA> access my data any time <PARA> “ name of app ” may access my data when i ’ m not using the application <PARA> if prurient interest prompted the visitor to allow the app to run , the program so unleashed could access that person ’ s facebook information and begin posting messages to his facebook page , and could continue to do so even when the overly curious was no longer trying to see the “ heartbreaking ” message supposedly left by the deceased ’ s father . the purpose of such activity was to get even more people to attempt to look at the phantom message via “ clickjacking ,” using the unsuspecting victim ’ s facebook account to post a status update with a link to an “ omg i can ’ t believe what her dad said !!” page . <PARA> the ultimate purpose of all this activity was to take those who ’ d been tricked into trying to view the message and lead them down a path to a survey screen , which they were told they must complete before being allowed to access the content of the horrifying message . the survey appeared to be the actual goal of the scam , earning money for those who were running it . however , actual harm to the curious should not be ruled out , as information gathered via such surveys can also be put to bad purposes . <PARA> the precursor of this scam was an august 2010 virus hoax that made the rounds of cyberspace : <PARA> warning : there is a virus going around again , if you see a girl who killed herself over something her father wrote on her wall do not open it , it is a virus and it will not allow you to delete it , please pass this on before someone opens it .

unproven	apologies for the offensive language in the first example . the quote comes from 1917 , a time when racist humor was the norm . it stands not only as an early example of the legend , but also as an eloquent expression of the racist message which underpins it . accept it as a graphic example of what this legend is really about . <PARA> examples : <PARA> before delving into the legend itself , an entire category of “ funny names ” has to be dismissed . key to the legend is the belief that the parents acted unknowingly in bestowing an embarrassing name on the young ‘ un . unusual names are not in themselves folkloric ; what makes them so are the perceived motivations of the parents . <PARA> there ’ s nothing folkloric about a child christened female ( pronounced fuh - mall - ee ) if the parents understood full well what they were doing when they ponied up with the name . a classic example of non - folkloric use is found in the 1981 movie pilot of the tv series cagney & lacey . a prostitute gives her name to the desk sergeant but , as he ’ s not familiar with fuh - mall - ee , he asks her to spell it . “ f - e - m - a - l - e ,” she offers . “ that ’ s female ,” he says in disbelief . “ yeah , well my parents had twelve kids ,” responds the woman . “ by the time they got to me they ’ d run out of names .” <PARA> a properly folkloric version of the fuh - mall - ee tale would have it that the parents saw the “ name ” on the baby ’ s bracelet . not being able to read well , they sounded it out badly , it fell on their ears prettily , and thus baby was named . alternatively , they interpreted what was written on the bracelet as the hospital having already named their child and the matter now being out of their hands . <PARA> real - life fuh - mall - ees are beside the point ; what matters is how they came by the name . <PARA> as the 1917 example shows , this legend has been around for dogs ’ years . it now exists in two slightly different forms — the parents either misread a word , coming up with an unusual but pleasant - sounding pronunciation of same , or a member of the medical staff is overheard to properly pronounce the word , the parents think it pretty , and thus choose to stick the youngster with it . <PARA> names reported to have resulted from misinterpretations of the written word : <PARA> vagina ( va - gee - na ) <PARA> names reported to have resulted from overhearing an unusual but flowery - sounding term : <PARA> vagina ( va - jai - na ) <PARA> either way , the tale swings on the fictitious parents ’ lack of education and how this leads them to choose a totally unsuitable name . <PARA> this legend is not strictly told of african - americans ; white southerners are also sometimes cast in the starring role . <PARA> examining the 1917 example again , the proud black grandmother and her daughter are seen as attempting to exceed their presumed place and are punished for this act . rather than stick to her own , the daughter has chosen an important - sounding name for her child . her “ uppityness ” is duly rewarded by the joke being on her and her family . <PARA> legend of the “ kid named eczema ” ilk attempt to reinforce belief in the rightness of racism or regionalism . just as parables were used in the bible to communicate in a simple - to - understand form a behavior thought worthy of emulation , racist legends try to drive home the point that the looked - down - upon group is inherently inferior . presenting the moral in the form of a story makes it easier to absorb . <PARA> racism and / or regionalism play a part in a number of legends . ( see our password page for another such representative tale .) the more stories like these are told , the more the message of them is worked into the fabric of the people exposed to them . hearing the “ kid named eczema ” story again and again makes it that much more easy to think of blacks as less intelligent . <PARA> was there ever a mother so stupid as to name her kid eczema without realizing what the name meant ? probably not . but because the story fits in with what ’ s already believed about the shortcomings of whichever group the mother is supposedly part of , the tale will be re - told and believed anew . <PARA> some legendary names : <PARA> nosmo king <PARA> there was a nosmo king , but it was a matter of a grown man adopting an unusual stage name , not of an infant being saddled with his mother ’ s stupidity . h . vernon watson ( b . 1886 , d . 1949 ) was a well - known british music hall artist before world war i . in the early 1920s , watson did a “ blackface ” bit under the fanciful name of nosmo king . the routine went over so well that by 1925 watson was billed as his onstage persona , nosmo king . <PARA> ima hogg <PARA> ima hogg was real , but not her rumored sister , ura . ima ( b . 1882 d . 1975 ) was the daughter of james steven hogg , governor of texas . <PARA> mark lemongello <PARA> a pitcher for the houston astros in the 1970s . <PARA> shanda lear <PARA> daughter of bill and moya lear ( of lear jet fame ). <PARA> trout fishing in america <PARA> in april 1994 peter eastman jr . changed his name to trout fishing in america . the 17 - year - old from santa barbara figured it would be cool to name himself after a book he liked . rumor has it he goes by “ trout ”. <PARA> ronly bonly jones <PARA> this name is likely apocryphal although many have claimed their fathers knew someone similarly afflicted ( i . e ., jonly bonly stuart , bonly nonly jones , nonly monly jones , gonly bonly jones ).

true	origins : for several decades now , state motor vehicle departments of states have employed resources — both human and automated ones — to ensure that potentially offensive strings of characters ( such as “ fuk ”) do not appear in the letter and number <PARA> combinations used on motor vehicle license plates . the process has never been perfectly straightforward , since factors other than predictable letter combinations have to be considered . for one thing , certain digits can be mistaken for letters ( e . g ., from a distance , the numbers 0 , 1 , and 5 are easily confused with the letters o , i , and s ). and <PARA> the advent of motorist - selected personalized plates in the 1970s added a whole new dimension to the problem , as motor vehicle departments could no longer rely upon anticipating the regular letter - number patterns issued in sequence but had to scrutinize each application individually to weed out a variety of tricks : applicants combining letters and numbers designed to spell out words and phrases (“ i h8 u ”), sneaking in slang sexual terms ( such as “ 69 ”), or even slipping through suggestive combinations intended to be read backwards as reflected in rear - view mirrors <PARA> (“ 3mta3 ”). <PARA> the license plate displayed in the photograph demonstrates how difficult it is to foresee every conceivable problem in this regard , with letters , numbers resembling letters , and the decorative orange that appears in the center of a florida plate all joining to turn the innocuous combination a55 rgy into something that can be read as the risqué phrase “ ass orgy .” the photo hasn ’ t been manipulated , nor is the license plate shown a personalized one ( deliberately chosen for its naughtiness or otherwise ) — the tag is a random , regular - issue plate assigned to a lincoln ls automobile registered to a miami - based computer company . and thanks to the internet , it ’ s now one of the most recognizable license plates in the u . s .

mixture	an old joke runs as follows : <PARA> this jape exemplifies a bit of twisted logic worthy of gracie allen : if your problem doesn ’ t fit the location , then make the location fit the problem . that ’ s the reasoning behind the letter to the editor reproduced above , one which advocates that a “ deer crossing ” warning sign should be moved to an area with less traffic because too many of the animals are being struck by automobiles at its current location . ( the humor , of course , is that such a sign merely alerts motorists that deer are present in the area — it doesn ’ t lure deer to the area or encourage them to cross the roadway there , so moving the sign elsewhere would do nothing to ameliorate the stated problem .) <PARA> this letter was indeed submitted by crown point , indiana , resident tim abbott and published by the munster , indiana , times on 19 august 2011 , and the missive garnered a good deal of public attention after it was read on the air by tonight show host jay leno in september 2011 and again when it was posted on the facebook page of star trek actor george takei in june 2012 . <PARA> in a june 2012 follow - up article about the letter , its author declined to explictly confirm whether he had meant it to be taken seriously or humorously , but the tenor of his response clearly indicated the latter : <PARA> on 17 september 2012 , a woman later dubbed “ donna the deer lady ” called the weekly “ vent line ” feature of fargo radio station y94 ’ s “ morning playhouse ” show and stated that she had been in three car accidents involving deer in the last few years , all of which had occurred near deer - crossing signs ; she then offered seemingly earnest complaints about officials ’ “ allowing these deer crossings to be in such high - traffic areas ” and questioned “ why we are encouraging deer to cross the interstate .” the following month , a recording of that call received wide circulation on the internet via youtube . <PARA> however , others such as tampa radio talk show host todd schnitt maintain that “ donna ” was actually a fake caller who has been used by y94 ’ s hosts more than once to stage supposedly real , outrageous phone conversations . according to schnitt , she appeared on the station again in october 2013 claiming that she was going to hand out “ fat letters ” on halloween to trick - or - treaters she did not deem thin enough to deserve candy .

<PARA> origins : this alarmist warning about a provision of the patient protection and affordable care act [ ppaca ] ( commonly known as “ obamacare ”) supposedly authorizing federal agents to undertake “ forced home inspections ” under the guise of ensuring eligibility began in august 2013 as a blog post that was picked up and uncritically spread via other blogs and web sites . the original entry claimed , in part , that : <PARA> according to an obamacare provision millions of americans will be targeted . <PARA> the health and human services ’ website states that your family will be targeted if you fall under the “ high - risk ” categories below : <PARA> families where mom is not yet 21 . <PARA> families where someone is a tobacco user . <PARA> families where children have low student achievement , developmental delays , or disabilities . <PARA> families with individuals who are serving or formerly served in the armed forces , including such families that have members of the armed forces who have had multiple deployments outside the united states . <PARA> there is no reference to medicaid being the determinant for a family to be “ eligible .” <PARA> in 2011 , the hhs announced $ 224 million will be given to support evidence - based home visiting programs to “ help parents and children .” individuals from the state will implement these leveraging strategies to “ enhance program sustainability .” <PARA> constitutional attorney and author kent masterson brown states , <PARA> “ this is not a ‘ voluntary ’ program . the eligible entity receiving the grant for performing the home visits is to identify the individuals to be visited and intervene so as to meet the improvement benchmarks . a homeschooling family , for instance , may be subject to ‘ intervention ’ in ‘ school readiness ’ and ‘ social - emotional developmental indicators .’ a farm family may be subject to ‘ intervention ’ in order to ‘ prevent child injuries ’ the sky is the limit .” <PARA> the health and human services ’ website states that your family will be targeted if you fall under the “ high - risk ” categories below : <PARA> there is no reference to medicaid being the determinant for a family to be “ eligible .” <PARA> in 2011 , the hhs announced $ 224 million will be given to support evidence - based home visiting programs to “ help parents and children .” individuals from the state will implement these leveraging strategies to “ enhance program sustainability .” <PARA> constitutional attorney and author kent masterson brown states , <PARA> “ this is not a ‘ voluntary ’ program . the eligible entity receiving the grant for performing the home visits is to identify the individuals to be visited and intervene so as to meet the improvement benchmarks . a homeschooling family , for instance , may be subject to ‘ intervention ’ in ‘ school readiness ’ and ‘ social - emotional developmental indicators .’ a farm family may be subject to ‘ intervention ’ in order to ‘ prevent child injuries ’ the sky is the limit .” <PARA> no provision of the ppaca authorizes federal agents to undertake “ forced home inspections .” what this item ( erroneously ) references is the ppaca ’ s creation of the maternal , infant , and early childhood home visiting program ( miechv ), which “ facilitates collaboration and partnership at the federal , state , and community levels to improve health and <PARA> development outcomes for at - risk children through evidence - based home visiting programs ” by awarding development grants to states that “ currently have modest home visiting programs and want to build on existing efforts .” <PARA> the grant program is intended to assist states ( not the federal government ) in conducting voluntary in - home visits to high - risk households with children younger than the age of five to help match those families with government services related to issues such as maternal and child health , child development , school readiness , economic self - sufficiency , and child abuse prevention . ( these home visiting programs are not something new created by obamacare ; there were extant home visiting programs in nearly every state prior to the passage of the ppaca .) <PARA> as noted in a september 2011 press release from the u . s . department of health and human services ( hhs ): <PARA> “ home visiting programs play a critical role in the nation ’ s efforts to help children get off to a strong start . parenting is a tough job , and helping parents succeed pays big dividends in a child ’ s well - being and healthy development ,” said hhs secretary kathleen sebelius . <PARA> both the formula and competitive grants will be used by state agencies to support home visiting programs that bring nurses , social workers , or other health care professionals to meet with at - risk families that agree to meet with them in their homes . they work with families to evaluate their circumstances , help parents gain the skills they need to succeed in promoting healthy development in their children , and connect families to the kinds of help that can make a real difference in a child ’ s health , development , and ability to learn . <PARA> research has shown that home visiting programs can improve outcomes for children and families , including improving maternal and child health , reducing child maltreatment , increasing parental employment , and improving the rate at which children reach developmental milestones . hhs undertook an exhaustive review of the research evidence on different home visiting programs to identify the models that have been shown to work . <PARA> both the formula and competitive grants will be used by state agencies to support home visiting programs that bring nurses , social workers , or other health care professionals to meet with at - risk families that agree to meet with them in their homes . they work with families to evaluate their circumstances , help parents gain the skills they need to succeed in promoting healthy development in their children , and connect families to the kinds of help that can make a real difference in a child ’ s health , development , and ability to learn . <PARA> research has shown that home visiting programs can improve outcomes for children and families , including improving maternal and child health , reducing child maltreatment , increasing parental employment , and improving the rate at which children reach developmental milestones . hhs undertook an exhaustive review of the research evidence on different home visiting programs to identify the models that have been shown to work . <PARA> the ppaca defines high - risk households as : <PARA> however , nothing in the ppaca authorizes federal or state agents to “ target ” and conduct forced inspections at such households . the ppaca requires that miechv grant recipients give priority to such households ( because that ’ s where the return on money spent is highest ), but as stated in the press release quoted above , the miechv grant program brings “ nurses , social workers , or other health care professionals to meet with at - risk families that agree to meet with them in their homes . likewise , the relevant section ( p . 251 ) of the ppaca specifically states that miechv grant recipients must provide “ assurances that the entity will establish procedures to ensure that the participation of each eligible family in the program is voluntary .”	
false	origins : the renowned nobel prize is the legacy of swedish chemist , inventor , and industrialist alfred nobel , <PARA> whose 1895 will specified that most of his fortune be set aside to establish a fund for the awarding of five annual prizes “ to those who , during the preceding year , shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind .” the first nobel prizes were distributed on 10 december 1901 , the fifth anniversary of nobel ’ s death , for achievements in the fields specified by nobel : physics , chemistry , medicine , literature , and peace . ( a prize for a sixth category , economics , was added by the bank of sweden beginning in 1969 .) <PARA> in the century since the nobel foundation was established , many have speculated on the reasons why alfred nobel did not provide for a prize to be awarded for achievement in the field of mathematics . surely an eminent man of science such as alfred nobel could not simply have forgotten about mathematics , so he must have had a good reason for omitting it . with no obvious reason at hand , people invented one , and as usual the invented tale had a bit of salaciousness to it : alfred nobel deliberately avoided establishing a prize for mathematics out of vindictiveness because a prominent swedish mathematician was carrying on an affair with his wife . <PARA> the “ wife ” theory is easily discounted , since nobel was never married . some variations of the legend claim it was nobel ’ s fiancée or mistress who was carrying on the affair , with her partner in infidelity identified as the eminent swedish mathematician gosta mittag - leffler . nobel reportedly did have a mistress , a viennese woman named sophie hess , but there is no evidence she ever had anything to do with mittag - leffler . another version of the legend maintains that nobel bore animosity towards mittag - leffler for some other reason , and he therefore avoided establishing a mathematics prize because mittag - leffler would almost certainly have been one of its first recipients . however , this version also has little factual evidence to support it , as : <PARA> okay then , so why did alfred nobel give mathematics a pass ? there is no definitive answer since nobel didn ’ t explain his reasons , but there are several plausible possibilities : <PARA> as professor ordinarius in stockholm , mittag - leffler began a 30 - year career of vigorous mathematical activity . in 1882 he founded the acta mathematica , which a century later is still one of the world ’ s leading mathematical journals . through his influence in stockholm he persuaded king oscar ii to endow prize competitions and honor various distinguished mathematicians all over europe . hermite , bertrand , weierstrass , and poincare were among those honored by the king . <PARA> nobel may have been hesitant to compete with this established prize by creating one of his own . <PARA> whenever a man ’ s motivations for a course of action aren ’ t clear , attributing them to something sexual usually creates a tale both plausible and entertaining . which is what urban legends are about , after all . <PARA> sightings : the legend about there being no nobel prize in mathematics thanks to some hanky panky between a mathematician and nobel ’ s wife is repeated in an episode of the television series numb3rs (“ obsession ,” original air date 7 october 2005 ).	
unproven	origins : perhaps no single work of american literature is as firmly woven into our tapestry of popular culture and folklore as l . frank baum ’ s the wonderful wizard of oz . first published in 1900 , baum ’ s tale of a little kansas girl lifted to a faraway land by a <PARA> cyclone had sold 5 million copies before its copyright expired in 1956 , and the 1939 musical film version with judy garland ( although not initially successful ) has probably been viewed more times by more people than any other film in the history of cinema . <PARA> in the decades since the book and film versions of the wizard of oz ( as it is now more popularly known ) were first presented to audiences , our fondness for minutiae has spurred numerous articles dissecting the details of how , when , and why both versions were created . questions such as “ why did baum choose ‘ toto ’ as the name of dorothy ’ s dog ?”, “ why does dorothy wear ruby slippers in the film version when the book has her shod in silver slippers ?”, and “ should baum have more properly described the storm that lifted dorothy ’ s house of kansas as a ‘ tornado ’ rather than a ‘ cyclone ’?” have prompted debate and discussion , as no oz topic , it seems , is too trivial to be the subject of serious investigation . <PARA> one of the more famous items of oz trivia is the selection of the name for baum ’ s make - believe land , which was featured not just in the wonderful wizard of oz , but in the title of thirteen subsequent books as well . the name oz is short , yet catchy and wonderfully evocative , and , as legend has it , the name boasts a suitably whimsical origin as well : baum , pressed for a name by the children to whom he was unfolding his tale <PARA> of characters in search of a great wizard , drew inspiration from a nearby file cabinet drawer and dubbed his fictional locale ‘ oz .’ <PARA> is this anecdote the true origin of ‘ oz ,’ or is it merely one of those tales created and repeated because it makes for a much more colorful and satisfying answer than “ i don ’ t remember ” or “ it doesn ’ t mean anything ; it just came to me one day ”? the version cited as an example above is the explanation given in a 1961 biography of baum by one of his sons , frank j . baum8 , and another of his children , harry neal baum , repeated the same story to a chicago daily news reporter in 1965 , saying : “ father tried and discarded many names for his land , writing at his rolltop desk , and one day he glanced at its three file drawers and was inspired .” 1 <PARA> we don ’ t have to rely upon whatever baum ’ s children may have been told for verification , however , as baum himself had offered essentially the same story many years earlier in a press release drafted to announce the reissue of the wonderful wizard of oz in 1903 : <PARA> i have a little cabinet letter file on my desk that is just in front of me . i was thinking and wondering about a title for the story , and had settled on the “ wizard ” as part of it . my gaze was caught by the gilt letters on the three drawers of the cabinet . the first was a - g ; the next drawer was labeled h - n ; and on the last were the letters o - z . and “ oz ” it at once became . <PARA> this evidence wouldn ’ t seem to leave much room for doubt , as baum himself is undeniably the one person who knows how he came to choose the name , and this explanation comes straight from the horse ’ s pen , so to speak . baum ’ s version does differ from the one offered by his son in that the latter places him in a roomful of children rather than alone in his study , but that difference might be dismissed as a mere literary embellishment on his son ’ s part . even baum ’ s version contains its own discrepancies , though , as various pre - publication references and copyright registrations reveal that baum considered several titles for his book using the word “ oz ” but not the word “ wizard ” ( e . g ., “ the city of the great oz ,” “ the fairyland of oz ,” “ the land of oz ”), so clearly he had not “ settled on the ‘ wizard ’ as part of it ” before coming up with the name ‘ oz .’ 2 moreover , baum ’ s wife maud wrote to a friend in 1943 that : <PARA> the word oz came out of mr . baum ’ s mind , just as did his queer characters . no one or anything suggested the word — or any person . this is a fact . <PARA> the discrepancy in baum ’ s version could easily be chalked up to the fallibility of human memory — he was writing more than three years after the fact , and his not remembering a small detail such as whether he had first settled on “ wizard ” or “ oz ” as a title word wouldn ’ t be at all unusual . and his wife ’ s much later insistence that no “ thing ” or “ person ” had suggested the name to him could have been intended to discount some other version of its origins , not to completely disclaim the idea that he might have drawn inspiration from a file drawer . <PARA> still , this wouldn ’ t be nearly as interesting an article if we labeled this claim as a legend and left things at that , so we ’ ll engage in some additional flights of fancy — namely a listing of other explanations offered by various oz chroniclers over the years : <PARA> ( our equivalent of “ the alpha and the omega ” — the first and last letters of the greek alphabet — would be the letters a and z : when combined they produce “ a - z ”, which might be pronounced “ oz .” note , however , that “ oz ” was rhymed with the word “ was ” in a song drafted for an unpublished dramatization of baum ’ s book in 1901 , which indicates that baum himself pronounced it more like “ uz .”) <PARA> if we had to choose a winner from all the candidates in this contest , we ’ d go with l . frank baum ’ s explanation . if the author of one of literature ’ s most popular children ’ s fantasy series had really wanted to concoct a fanciful explanation for the origins of “ oz ,” surely he could have come up with something more imaginative than a file drawer .

unproven	while on a lunch break , members of a work crew were idly shoving boulders over the edge of the steep road when they suddenly heard the sound of a rock hitting metal . <PARA> it turned out that buried among the jagged rocks of the roadside was a wrecked old car with 1950s canadian license plates . inside , still looking straight ahead , were the skeletons of four unfortunate passengers . <PARA> origins : like a good many urban legends , the tale of the “ lost wreck ” reflects some societal fears that are perhaps <PARA> as old as mankind itself , primarily apprehensions about our safety when we venture out into the world alone . if something unfortunate should happen to us when we ’ re outside the view of others , will anyone be there to come to our assistance ? if we fail to return from an excursion as expected , will anyone notice we ’ re missing , or care enough to go looking for us ? will searchers be able to find us ? could it be our chilling fate that we will simply perish in some remote place , with no one knowing or caring about our demise ? <PARA> as folklorist jan harold brunvand notes in curses ! broiled again !, the modern “ lost wreck ” tale incorporates a key motif from a scandinavian legend known since the nineteenth century , with a norwegian version described as follows : <PARA> “ once there was a hunter who was out shooting grouse . it must have been a long time ago , for he was using a bow and arrow . he caught sight of a bird sitting in a tree a shot at it , but a strange clang was heard as though the arrow had struck a metal object . the hunter went over to see what it was , and underneath some huge trees stood an ancient church .” <PARA> the hunter had discovered the site of a village apparently completely wiped out by the plague . the metal his arrow had struck was the old churchbell . <PARA> the hunter had discovered the site of a village apparently completely wiped out by the plague . the metal his arrow had struck was the old churchbell . <PARA> although they don ’ t necessarily match all the details recounted in modern versions of the “ lost wreck ” legend , many true instances of long - dead bodies discovered in wrecked automobiles have been reported over the years . one of the more notable cases was that of susie roberts of gainesville , georgia , who disappeared with a friend while they were on their way home from a dance in the nearby town of dawsonville one day in 1958 . although the friend ’ s body turned up a year later , roberts ’ body remained undiscovered until <PARA> workers building a bridge found and pulled the car containing her remains from the bottom of lake lanier thirty - two years later . <PARA> another similar real - life version of the “ car filled with skeletons discovered by happenstance ” story would be the case of kimberly marie barnes and her four friends , who disappeared from palm beach , florida , in a van one summer evening in 1979 . their fate remained unknown until a mud - filled van was spotted in palm beach county canal by a fisherman eighteen years later ; the automobile was dragged out and came within seconds of being shredded for scrap when a miami salvage yard manager noticed a shin bone fall from the van . investigators later found a total of five skulls inside . <PARA> in september 2013 , highway patrol officials who were testing new sonar equipment on foss lake , in a remote , sparsely populated area of southwestern oklahoma , discovered two submerged , decades - old cars containing a total of six human skulls and matching bones . one vehicle , a 1969 chevy camaro , contained the remains of three sayre , oklahoma , teenagers who vanished on their way to a friday night football game in 1970 . the other car , a 1952 chevy , held the remains of an oklahoma man and two friends who disappeared in april 1969 . <PARA> this legend is similar in structure to crushin ’ roulette , both of them involving the discovery of long - wrecked automobiles with human remains inside . <PARA> sightings : an episode of tv ’ s law and order (“ ramparts ,” original air date 13 january 1999 ) opens with a van containing the skeleton of a decades - old murder victim being dredged from the hudson river .

false	this report has been circulating around the internet for several years at least . <PARA> examples : <PARA> the story is almost certainly false for a number of highly technical reasons . first off , police radar is relatively weak — it doesn ’ t need to be strong , and you wouldn ’ t want to fry passing motorists or the police officers who use it daily . these units don ’ t have much range ; a few miles or so is sufficient since the police officer needs to be in line - of - sight with the vehicle he ’ d like to track . <PARA> next , a number of different radar types ( pulse , continuous - scan , doppler , and so on ) are used for different purposes . doppler radar is used for tracking the speed of an object , whether it ’ s a moving automobile or a particularly threatening thunderstorm . pulse units are used for aerial and naval navigation as well as military applications ; in the latter case their on / off nature makes it slightly more difficult for an enemy to identify their source . <PARA> additionally , there are different types of scan profiles in use , such as circular , unidirectional , bi - directional , helical , raster , palmer , conical , and track - while - scan . police radar units are directional ones that send pulses in a relatively narrow cone in the direction the officer points the device . ( this type of radar is used to prevent the operators from being exposed to the devices ’ high - frequency radiation over long periods of time .) therefore , it ’ s pretty unlikely that an officer pointing a hand - held unit at an incoming car would also manage to illuminate a flying aircraft — an intervening hill , a large building , or even heavy plant growth would block any stray signal . <PARA> surface - to - air missile ( sam ) radars behave differently than handheld police units . also , each type or model of radar gives off very specific characteristics , and the onboard systems in military planes can differentiate among these types of threats ( e . g ., a sam - 2 vs . a zsu vs . an f - 16 ). to quote from info - strategies ’ web site , “ every radar produces a radio frequency ( rf ) signal with specific characteristics that differentiate it from all other signals and define its capabilities and limitations .” excepting a case of incredible coincidence , the police radar wouldn ’ t be on the “ threat ” list . also , sam radar units are also relatively short range systems ( 30 - 50km ), since the usual practice is to employ longer - range tracking stations to keep watch on incoming aircraft , then alert the sam unit in the aircraft ’ s flight path of the impending arrival of the hostile plane . <PARA> building on the above , we also need to remember that radar is in common use all over the world , and europe sports some densely - packed airspace . all aircraft are tracked by large , fixed stations in order to prevent mid - air collisions and other accidents . thus , the tornado in question was most likely being “ painted ” by multiple radar stations at various airports around the uk , and possibly also from the continent . a puny police traffic - enforcement radar signal wouldn ’ t even be noticed in all the noise . <PARA> next , and very important to our understanding of this legend , the systems on military aircraft will not automatically arm and fire offensive ordnance . this is the case to specifically prevent incidents such as the one described in this story . there ’ s no way that the tornado ’ s systems would auto - arm a missile , much less try to fire it without a human “ go ” signal . at any rate , a human operator in a non - wartime situation would need explicit permission to fire at an enemy position ; if the pilot in our story was alerted of a possible “ threat ” radar signal by an onboard system , he or she could simply confirm the source by checking the direction from which the signal was emanating . as the police unit was outside any military firing range it would be obvious from the start that the signal was not a threat or was merely a spurious contact . <PARA> lastly , there are glaring factual errors in the story itself . the “ sidewinder ” is a heat - seeking air - to - air missile ( aam ) designed for short - range strikes against attacking aircraft . in other variants of the story , an “ asraam ” ( also a heat - seeking aam ) is mentioned . neither would ever be used against a ground - based target ; instead an alarm ( air - launched anti - radar missile ), agm - 65a “ maverick ,” or as . 30 ( l ) air - to - surface missile ( asm ) would be fired . also , the act of “ jamming ” radar does not involve disabling the unit itself , but rather forces it to produce inaccurate or widely fluctuating results ( or no results at all ) in order to confuse the operator and any incoming missiles are attempting to “ lock ” onto the target . <PARA> this urban legend seems to be a classic “ warning against technology ” tale , cautioning us against the development of systems that could somehow escape human control and cause havoc . compare this tale with cruise control , in which a misunderstanding of the operation of an automotive device leads to a serious accident . also think of the y2k craze , or even to recent stories of the purported existence of an automated “ armageddon ” system called “ dead hand ” in russia ( which was supposedly about to fire all soviet missiles on 1 / 1 / 2000 after the computers failed ). all are about our fear of modern technology and how a possible lack of human control in a given situation spells disaster .	
false	her name is kaydance bearden . she is my baby cousin and is only 2 years old ! she was kidnapped sometime yesterday in the saline / pulaski county area and we need help finding her . please !!! she has blonde hair , blue eyes and weighs about 25 pounds . it is quite possible that the lady who took her is heading to florida . please , please , please share and spread the word . help us find our little girl and bring her home safely !!! <PARA> origins : this item claiming that a 2 - year - old girl named kaydance bearden was kidnapped was posted by a facebook user on 1 september 2013 , with no details other than the girl ’ s name and the mention of a general geographic area ( arkansas ’ saline and pulaski counties ). we found no information about a girl named kaydance bearden other than postings of this same message — no police reports , fbi bulletins , amber alerts , news articles , or any other expected references to a kidnapped child with that name — but on the following day the same facebook user reported that kaydance had been found .	
false	origins : these days postal customers have a multiplicity of options for buying postage : they can purchase stamps not only at post offices but also from private mailbox chain outlets and from many grocery , warehouse , and convenience stores ; they can order stamps by phone , through the mail , or over the internet ; and they can even print out postage stamps themselves through programs operated by authorized u . s . postal service ( usps ) vendors . it wasn ’ t all that long ago , however , when many customers had few ( if any ) alternatives for obtaining stamps other than by trekking down to the local post office . it might be memories from those days — when the u . s . post office department was strictly a government agency ( i . e ., prior to the creation of the usps in 1970 ) and its offices were the only sales outlet for stamps for many people — that have fostered the mistaken belief it is illegal to re - sell u . s . postage stamps for a price greater than their face value . perhaps people viewed postage stamps as a type of government service , and therefore they thought making a <PARA> profit from the resale of stamps was a form of illegal profiteering . <PARA> we know this not to be true from anecdotal evidence : years ago , one of the few sources of stamps other than the post office was the mechanical , lever - operated <PARA> machines commonly found in grocery stores which dispensed individual stamps ( rather than booklets ) and were notorious for not providing full value — depositing a dime in such a machine would typically fetch the customer something like one five - cent stamp and two one - cent stamps , or a quarter might buy three six - cent stamps and one three - cent stamp . even today , the private mailbox outlets that have sprung up across the country often add surcharges to the price of stamps they offer their customers as a convenience . ( plus , if selling stamps for more than their face value were truly prohibited by law , then all philatelic sales of uncancelled stamps would be illegal .) <PARA> in any case , we don ’ t need to rely on anecdotal evidence , because the frequently asked questions ( faq ) section of the usps ’ s web site explains that it has no control over the prices other entities charge for reselling u . s . postage stamps : <PARA> selling stamps at a higher price <PARA> the postal service sells stamps at face value to everyone . we have no control over the pricing policies of private entrepreneurs , companies or agencies who resell our products . a charge at a higher price is most likely imposed to earn a return on their investment of capital and effort . the prices they charge are , no doubt , established on the basis of their needs and market evaluations . <PARA> customers may avoid paying more than the stated value for first - class mail postage by purchasing stamps at their post office , through stamps by mail , phone , online , automated postal centers and retail outlets that are involved with our consignment programs or from one of the many postal stores . <PARA> the postal service sells stamps at face value to everyone . we have no control over the pricing policies of private entrepreneurs , companies or agencies who resell our products . a charge at a higher price is most likely imposed to earn a return on their investment of capital and effort . the prices they charge are , no doubt , established on the basis of their needs and market evaluations . <PARA> customers may avoid paying more than the stated value for first - class mail postage by purchasing stamps at their post office , through stamps by mail , phone , online , automated postal centers and retail outlets that are involved with our consignment programs or from one of the many postal stores .	
mixture	variations : some october 2004 versions are prefaced “ cbs reported this type of identification theft is one of the fastest growing scams today .” ( if cbs had run a piece on cell phone cameras used by thieves to capture credit card numbers , it has escaped our notice . more likely , this claim was added by someone looking to infuse the mailing with a greater sense of credibility .) <PARA> origins : camera phones , the latest in cell phone wizardry , allow users to take pictures on the go and transmit these images by e - mail or post them to the web . with video phone in hand , unexpected sightings of celebrities can be snared with a flick of the wrist ( turning the celled into the snaparazzi ), as can chance encounters with pretty girls or gorgeous sunsets . though introduced in the usa only in 2002 , camera phones have already helped solve crimes and aided in the capture of criminals when quick - thinking phone owners had the wit to turn their units on their attackers . <PARA> are fast growing in popularity . yet they also have a dark side , one that ultimately might be their undoing . <PARA> most who purchase such instruments have only the most innocuous of pleasures in mind — they want to be able to take and transmit pictures of places they ’ re visiting and people they ’ re meeting . or they want to have something handy with which to snap photos if something hilarious plays out in front of them . however , at least some who are equipping themselves with this latest in technology are doing so for nefarious purposes . <PARA> camera phones have been banned in many public areas like swimming pools and locker rooms in the u . k . and japan after police discovered pedophiles were using the technology to add to their child porn collections . in japan , police have apprehended people using camera phones to take photos up the skirts of unsuspecting women in crowded trains and stores . in the u . s ., some state legislatures have before them bills that would serve to ban cell phone cameras in venues where folks have an expectation of privacy , such as locker rooms and restrooms . even without this legislation , a number of american health clubs and courthouses have barred their use on their premises . <PARA> yet the danger posed by these instruments may not end with embarrassing or lewd photos of the unsuspecting — quite possibly such phones may be used to harvest credit card data . information in other forms has already been purloined via camera phone , with newsstand owners in japan complaining folks armed with such gadgets have been photographing magazine articles instead of buying the issues , thereby cutting into their business . in january 2003 , <PARA> a web - based fashion magazine used video phones to beam photos from paris fashion shows , producing almost - live coverage of the catwalks and scooping the competition . pictures were sent directly to the web . <PARA> we first saw the warning against camera cell phone enabled identify thieves in january 2004 . although we ’ ve yet to stumble across reports of actual incidents of theft of credit card information by this method , the warning implicit to the e - mail is valid — the ill - intentioned could indeed photograph the face of your credit card with such devices . <PARA> at this time , most of the units on the market don ’ t take very good pictures , possibly not nearly high enough quality to capture what is , after all , fairly small raised print on fairly small items . video phone pictures aren ’ t high - resolution , and most camera phones can ’ t autofocus , lack onboard flash , and rely on long exposures — all limitations that conspire to make them unsuitable for data mining over someone ’ s shoulder . however , what they ( at this time ) lack in clarity of image , they make up for in distance their captures can be transmitted . unlike the cameras found secreted at atms , which could send their images to receivers no farther than about 200 meters away , video phones can relay what they see to the other side of the world . they are , after all , telephones . <PARA> although at this time the phones ’ limitations might appear to rule out the risk of your visa or mastercard details being harvested by camera phone - wielding thieves , the danger should not be discounted . the more expensive of these instruments take better photos , meaning they could pick off minute detail that lesser phones couldn ’ t , so every video phone should not be judged safe to flash your plastic to . moreover , the technology is improving , which makes it a good bet the next generation of camera phones will transmit sharper , clearer images . <PARA> in february 2005 , a retail fraud investigator for one of the larger chain stores told us that while he is still unable to capture a useable image of a credit card from even the newer camera phones , he has been able to grab readable images of all account and routing info from the personal checks customers have produced at the checkout . check writers , he says , have a tendency to “ lay out ” their check books on the writing counter at the registers and keep them stationary enough to obtain a clear image of all the personal information printed on the check . he has also tested this theory with camera - equipped palm tops and has found that with the adjustable resolution he has been able to get a pretty clear picture , with zoom , from a reasonable distance away ( 3 - 5 feet ). so at this point in time , while your credit card might still be secure , your personal check might not be . <PARA> as for camera phones themselves , whatever their limitations or potential for misuse , unless legislated out of existence , they are likely to become the next “ must have ” item . we do so love our toys , after all . <PARA> barbara “ surfeit usa ” mikkelson

where trayvon martin was killed ”) which maintained that the community relations service ( crs ) division of the department of justice <PARA> ( doj ) “ actively worked to foment unrest , spending thousands of taxpayer dollars on travel and hotel rooms to train protestors throughout florida ” in the wake of the shooting of trayvon martin by george zimmerman in sanford , florida , on 26 february 2012 . this item was quickly spun into headlines such as “ why did the obama administration ‘ organize and manage ’ protests against george zimmerman ?” on various conspiracy sites . <PARA> the documents published by judicial watch don ’ t support the claim that the crs was “ actively working to foment unrest ” or “ training protestors throughout florida ,” however — they mostly show the crs doing what it ’ s supposed to do , which is to defuse potentially explosive social and political situations before they explode into scenarios involving dangerous and violent conflict . <PARA> as the community relations service web page describes that organization ’ s mission : <PARA> the community relations service is the department [ of justice ]’ s “ peacemaker ” for community conflicts and tensions arising from differences of race , color , and national origin . created by the civil rights act of 1964 , crs is the only federal agency dedicated to assist state and local units of government , private and public organizations , and community groups with preventing and resolving racial and ethnic tensions , incidents , and civil disorders , and in restoring racial stability and harmony . <PARA> the documents published by judicial watch were primarily expense vouchers showing expenditures for crs personnel traveling to sanford ( at the request of city authorities ) to engage in such activities as “ provid [ ing ] technical assistance to the city of sanford , event organizers , and law enforcement agencies ” and “ providing technical assistance , conciliation , and onsite mediation ” during marches and rallies . it ’ s exceedingly unlikely that the city of sanford and various law enforcement agencies would have invited the crs to that area and worked with it in order to accomplish a goal of “ training ” and “ fomenting ” protestors . it ’ s also unlikely that if the crs were furtively working to stir up unrest over the trayvon martin case , they would have ( as documented on one travel voucher ) met with an official from the republican national convention in order to discuss the possibility of protests and demonstrations occurring during that event . <PARA> as the blaze reported on the subject : <PARA> [ the vouchers ] show that crs was meeting with a variety of people , including law enforcement and , at one point , the rnc . those expenses even include a reference to mediation . <PARA> and all that would seem to fulfill the mission of the group described on the crs website . <PARA> while that mission is not perfectly defined and leaves some room for interpretation , the expenses — traveling “ to work marches ,” “ provide technical assistance ,” etc . — are not unreasonable in that context : it is the purpose of the crs to travel to such places and “ work ” the marches . <PARA> the ostensible job of the crs is to act as a peacemaker for “ community conflicts and tensions arising from differences of race , color , and national origin .” they travel to the sources of conflict , using “ impartial mediation practices and conflict resolution procedures ” to restore peace and harmony . <PARA> in sum , without photos or video of compromising behavior that would show officials stirring up trouble , it seems an overreach to say the doj was actively involved in fomenting protests by citing their involvement in aspects surrounding them . especially when that involvement appears to be fulfilling the group ’ s mission . <PARA> and all that would seem to fulfill the mission of the group described on the crs website . <PARA> while that

true	origins : slang is one of the more fluid components of language , often calling upon perfectly ordinary words to pull double duty as terms for something else . thus , a lawyer becomes a “ mouthpiece ,” <PARA> a pretty woman a “ doll ” or a “ skirt ,” and a well - muscled bouncer a “ gorilla .” we delight in these dual uses because , in oddball fashion , these creative doublings seem to convey in a more vivid fashion the essences of the items at hand . <PARA> thus , names of various foodstuffs are often employed as casual terms for money ( a theme of sustenance , perhaps ?): lettuce , cabbage , coconuts , and even bananas . we accept these slang terms as an ordinary part of the linguistic landscape , barely giving them a second thought . yet sometimes that second thought is required , especially in the world of commerce . it was the use of “ banana ” in the monetary sense that caused $ 10 , 000 worth of trouble for a national chain of electronics stores . <PARA> in 1986 , silo ( a chain of home electronics stores ) ran a television commercial in 23 markets nationwide , offering stereos for “ 299 bananas .” they never thought anyone would take them at their word ; after all , “ banana ” is a widely accepted , if playful , term for greenbacks . who could possibly mistake one for the other ? thirty - two customers held the retailer to its unwitting word — they showed up bearing loads of the yellow fruit and demanding the store keep its end of the <PARA> bargain . <PARA> “ the ad said bananas , by golly , and so we had 32 buyers come to our southcenter distribution point saturday morning to exchange bananas for the stereos ,” ed altizer , silo district manager , said . <PARA> each stereo was exchanged for $ 40 to $ 60 worth of bananas , and silo took in a total of 11 , 000 bananas . many of the bananas were donated to woodland park zoo , but there were too many even for the hungry animals . <PARA> “ we need about 1 , 000 a week for the elephants , monkeys , gorillas , primates , hippos ,” said bob daleske of the zoo commissary . “ most of our animals like them , but we can ’ t just give them bananas in uncontrolled amounts .” <PARA> bananas were also donated to local food banks . <PARA> barbara “ banana republicans ” mikkelson

false	examples : <PARA> i just heard today a story that sounded like a hoax but couldn ’ t find it on your board . a friend went into a kids hair salon and was asking about shampoo . the beautician said that there was a recent show on 20 / 20 or 60 minutes , etc . that said johnson & johnson adds novocaine to their “ no more tears ” shampoo . the novocaine is added to prevent the burning sensation in the eyes . <PARA> [ collected via e - mail , march 2004 ] <PARA> someone told me that reason that johnson ’ s no more tears baby shampoo works is not because it ’ s gentle but because it has something in it that numbs children ’ s eyes to the sting of the cleansers . she was trying to sell us her company ’ s line of baby products that are gentler and i have to admit she caught my attention . though it does smack of urban legend material ! <PARA> [ collected via e - mail , august 2004 ] <PARA> only last night i was told that johnson and johnson no tears baby wash / shampoo had formaldahyde or novacaine ( or some kind of “ caine ”) in its ingredients so that it numbs the babies eyes so they don ’ t feel the sting . <PARA> [ collected via e - mail , november 2011 ] <PARA> a friend who is expecting , and who is normally very tech - savvy , has stated outright that she refuses to use johnson & johnson products as they “ put anasthetic in the ‘ no more tears ’ shampoo so that the children don ’ t cry – it ’ s not a weaker or different shampoo at all ”, and that “ many of their baby products like baby powder are carcinogenic ”. <PARA> origins : we ’ re not sure how long the rumor that “ no tears ” baby shampoos contain desensitizing agents ( novocaine , lidocaine , xylocaine ) has been around , but we ’ ve been encountering it since at least 1994 . the rumor plays upon a deep - seated belief that some things are too good to be true ; in this case , that belief is applied to the notion that if a shampoo doesn ’ t irritate a baby ’ s eyes when it finds its way into them , this lack of suffering must be due to the presence of some sort of anesthetic that numbs the delicate tissues it encounters . <PARA> concerns to the contrary , there are no anesthetics in these products . if there were , caregivers everywhere would be experiencing numbness in their hands after washing their children ’ s hair . moreover , if novocaine or any of its cousins were used in baby shampoo to produce a “ no tears ” effect , that usage would create the dangerous situation of the shampoo ’ s potentially causing harm to a child ’ s eyes while suppressing the warning signs ( pain ) and natural defenses ( tears ) that protect against such harm . <PARA> overdoses of lidocaine have led to severe toxicity or death in both children and adults , so there is an especial need to protect youngsters from overexposure to that drug — amounts that are innocuous for grownups may present a significant <PARA> toxic hazard in children . if for no other reason than that , makers of baby shampoo would not use lidocaine in their products given <PARA> the risk of accidental oral ingestion of soap suds by children . <PARA> “ no more tears ” shampoos gain that effect from the nature of the chemicals used in their formulation , which trade off cleansing ability for mildness . mainstream shampoos generally contain lauryl sulfates that irritate the eyes and scalp but also leave hair very , very clean . baby shampoos instead use long chain surfactants ( which are far less efficient in emulsifying oil from hair ) or they include an ionic polymer in the formulation , either of which helps prevent the product from stinging when it gets into the eyes . <PARA> however , that is not to say that all has always been well with baby shampoos . in 2009 , the campaign for safe cosmetics analyzed the contents of dozens of products for children and discovered many of those goods contained two substances they identified as being of particular concern : formaldehyde and 1 , 4 dioxane . that organization brought pressure to bear upon johnson & johnson , the maker of johnson ’ s ® baby shampoo ( which as been on the market since 1953 ), to reformulate their product to remove a chemical that releases formaldehyde , a known carcinogen . in august 2012 , johnson & johnson pledged to eliminate formaldehyde , parabens , triclosan , and phthalates from all their baby products , and in may 2013 announced that they had done so . <PARA> 1 , 4 - dioxane , which forms as a byproduct during the manufacturing process of certain cosmetic ingredients , is harder to eliminate . johnson & johnson says it has reformulated about 70 percent of their baby products to reduce the amount of 1 , 4 - dioxane contained in them . <PARA> barbara “ chemical solution ” mikkelson

false	examples : <PARA> as the legend goes , petty wrote [“ american girl ”] about a university of florida coed who jumped to her death from the beatty towers dorm . one variation has the unnamed girl tripping on hallucinogens and attempting to fly . <PARA> [ collected on the internet , 2005 ] <PARA> while attending my brother - in - law ’ s graduation at uf this weekend , he gave us a quick tour around campus . he pointed to a building , saying “ some girl committed suicide off that building , tom petty wrote ‘ american girl ’ about it .” <PARA> origins : for <PARA> whatever reasons — perhaps as a way to make sense of otherwise enigmatic lyrics , perhaps just for fun , or perhaps a bit <PARA> of both — some popular songs ( such as phil collins ’ “ in the air tonight ” and james taylor ’ s “ fire and rain “) have become strongly associated with fan - created urban legends , narratives that attempt to link the lyrics to real - life events . another entry in this category is the byrds - like “ american girl ,” one of the standout tracks from tom petty and the heartbreakers ’ eponymous 1976 debut album . <PARA> according to legend , “ american girl ” was inspired by a student ’ s suicide at the university of florida ( uf ), one committed by a female student who jumped to her death from the balcony of her beaty towers dormitory room . it ’ s not hard to see why this story is so prevalent , as the reference to a suicide from a balcony is an obvious interpretation of the lyrics ; tom petty himself is from gainesville ( where uf is located ); and the words mention “ 441 ,” a highway that runs past the school ( and beaty towers ): <PARA> well , she was an american girl , <PARA> raised on promises . <PARA> she couldn ’ t help thinkin ’ that there <PARA> was a little more to life <PARA> somewhere else . <PARA> after all it was a great big world <PARA> with lots of places to run to . <PARA> yeah , and if she had to die <PARA> tryin ’ she had one little promise <PARA> she was gonna keep . <PARA> it was kind of cold that night <PARA> she stood alone on her balcony . <PARA> she could hear the cars roll by <PARA> out on 441 <PARA> like waves crashin ’ in the beach , <PARA> and for one desperate moment there <PARA> he crept back in her memory . <PARA> god it ’ s so painful , <PARA> something that ’ s so close <PARA> and still so far out of reach . <PARA> it was kind of cold that night <PARA> she stood alone on her balcony . <PARA> she could hear the cars roll by <PARA> out on 441 <PARA> like waves crashin ’ in the beach , <PARA> and for one desperate moment there <PARA> he crept back in her memory . <PARA> god it ’ s so painful , <PARA> something that ’ s so close <PARA> and still so far out of reach . <PARA> of course , the lyrics don ’ t specifically mention gainesville or the university of florida or beaty towers , and u . s . highway 441 spans about a thousand miles from miami , florida , to lake city , tennessee . moreover , plenty of students familiar with uf have pointed out that the beaty towers buildings don ’ t feature balconies , and the rooms have windows too small and awkwardly positioned to serve as practical exit points for would - be jumpers . but we don ’ t need to engage in speculation about geographic locales and the physical features of buildings , because tom petty himself addressed the legend of “ american girl ” in an interview reproduced in the book conversations with tom petty : <PARA> q : there ’ s the story that [‘ american girl ’] was based on the suicide of a girl at the university of florida . any truth to that ? <PARA> a : urban legend . it ’ s become a huge urban myth down in florida . that ’ s just not at all true . the song has nothing to do with that . but that story really gets around ... and that ’ s happened with a lot of songs . but really extremely in that song . they ’ ve really got the whole story . i ’ ve even seen magazine articles about that story . is it true or isn ’ t it true ?

<PARA> a : i don ’ t remember exactly . i was living in an apartment where i was right by the freeway . and the cars would go by . in encino , near leon [ russell ]’ s house . and i remember thinking that that sounded like the ocean to me . that was my ocean . my malibu . where i heard the waves crash , but it was just the cars going by . i think that must have inspired the lyric . <PARA> a : i don ’ t remember exactly . i was living in an apartment where i was right by the freeway . and the cars would go by . in encino , near leon [ russell ]’ s house . and i remember thinking that that sounded like the ocean to me . that was my ocean . my malibu . where i heard the waves crash , but it was just the cars going by . i think that must have inspired the lyric . <PARA> an offshoot of the legend has uf students throwing halloween parties at tom petty ’ s former residence in gainesville every year , another assumption petty has disclosed as being based upon a fiction : <PARA> i ’ ll meet students from gainesville . and they ’ ll say , ‘ yeah , we party in your old house on halloween .’ there ’ s this tradition that they go to my house , whoever ’ s renting it at the time , and have this big party . but i never lived in a house in gainesville . i lived in apartments . i lived in my mom ’ s house , where i know they ’ re not throwing a party . so that ’ s also a myth . someone got a house and said , ‘ this is where he lived .’ that tradition has gone on and on . and every time i tell them it ’ s not true , they go , ‘ aaah ...’ [ laughs ] i almost am tempted to go ‘ oh great ,’ because i don ’ t want to pop their balloon .	
false	origins : native speakers of english accept without pause the many seemingly nonsensical sayings that are part and parcel of the vernacular . we blithely announce ‘ it ’ s raining cats and dogs ’ to communicate the concept of a heavy downpour , yet spare precious little thought to the realization that neither felines nor canines play any part in the process of rainfall . similarly , someone who is trying to say something without actually forthrightly stating it “ beats about the bush ” even when the topic being striven for is not shrubbery . for us , it ’ s the saying ’ s easy conveyance of meaning , not how it was put together , that matters . <PARA> another seemingly nonsensical familiar expression is ‘ the exception proves the rule .’ those who utter it use it to convey a message that an inconsistency confirms the validity of the hypothesis , which is an absurd notion . the existence of white bears , for instance , does not elevate to truth the statement “ all bears are brown or black .” <PARA> the meaning of ‘ the exception proves the rule ’ is actually quite different from its most common usage even though its core concept , that an exception establishes the validity of a rule or law , is accurate . <PARA> some who think they ’ re in the know attempt to explain the seeming contradiction of ‘ the exception proves the rule ’ by looking at the verb used in the aphorism in a less common fashion . while we ’ re now most familiar with ‘ prove ’ as a verb meaning ‘ to establish as truth ,’ an older meaning of that self - same word that has since almost disappeared from everyday usage defines it as meaning ‘ to test .’ by those lights , ‘ the exception proves the rule ’ should be read as ‘ the exception tests the rule ’ — that is , the contradiction puts the claim through its paces and finds it wanting . <PARA> yet even that is not the case . our puzzling saying is actually a legal maxim drawn from early 17th century english law . it was then written in latin as exceptio probat regulam <PARA> in casibus non exceptis , which translates into english as exception confirms the rule in the cases not excepted . more simply , ‘ the exception proves the rule exists ‘ — that certain exceptions are spelled out in a legal document or announcement confirms the rule ( minus the exceptions ) is in force at all other times . <PARA> if that sounds a bit hard to grasp , consider this : a sign announcing ‘ free parking on sunday ’ should lead one to conclude that on every other day of the week there will be a charge levied for leaving one ’ s car in that spot . the posted exception , therefore proves ( demonstrates ) that at other times the rule is in effect . <PARA> barbara “ clause and effect ” mikkelson

( hint : take a look at a 110 - gallon aquarium and imagine trying to boil a whole camel in that little water . indeed , try to imagine having a pot large enough in which to boil a camel , or even where you could buy one .) while all the other ingredients are quantified , the amount of salt needed for this enormous repast is left “ to taste .” <PARA> on the other hand , the guinness book of world records has included a similar dish in their listings ; however , they merely cite the recipe without documenting any instance of someone ’ s actually having used it : <PARA> the largest item on any menu in the world is roasted camel , prepared occasionally for bedouin wedding feasts . cooked eggs are stuffed into fish , the fish stuffed into cooked chickens , the chickens stuffed into a roasted sheep ’ s carcass and the sheep stuffed into a whole camel . <PARA> in the introduction to his book , the fearless diner , globe - hopping gourmet richard sterling described finally encountering someone who claimed to have cooked up a banquet of roast camel : <PARA> i was on my way to circumnavigate the globe a few years ago , to literally eat my way around the world . it was my gustatory goal for that year . i stopped in bangkok to visit sven krause , executive chef of the celadon restaurant in the beaufort sukhothai hotel . he took me into the inner sanctum of the celadon ’ s kitchen , where he dared me any half - dozen dishes just to prove he could make them and make them quickly . it was no contest . within minutes he presented me with a thai feast . as i <PARA> munched each delectable dish , i asked him to tell me his most unusual cooking experience . <PARA> “ you won ’ t believe it ,” he said . <PARA> “ try me ,” i said , feeling a tug of intuition about the tale he was going to relate . <PARA> “ i was working in saudi arabia ,” he continued . “ there was a wedding of some sheik or other . and you won ’ t believe what they wanted me to cook .” <PARA> i knew in my gut , in my gastronomic soul , that what i had long hoped was true . that it wasn ’ t just some wild traveler ’ s tale designed to stir the imagination and not the pot . the ultimate cookout was a reality . the only thing that could possibly be greater would be to spit - roast a giant squid . my wildest culinary dream could come true . sven , allah bless him and may his tribe increase , had done it . <PARA> “ i tell you no lie ,” he went on , sipping a cold one . “ they wanted camel . i roasted a whole camel on a spit .” <PARA> “ yes !” i cried . “ tell me everything .” and he did . he told me how he stuffed the camel with six sheep , stuffed the sheep with chickens , and the chickens with fish . he told me how it took 24 hours to cook , and that he served it on a silver platter in the shape of a recumbent camel . he related how the tribesmen who were the sheik ’ s guests then attacked it with their knives en masse , feasted with their bare hands , and ate the meat down to the ivory . <PARA> munched each delectable dish , i asked him to tell me his most unusual cooking experience . <PARA> “ you won ’ t believe it ,” he said . <PARA> “ try me ,” i said , feeling a tug of intuition about the tale he was going to relate . <PARA> “ i was working in saudi arabia ,” he continued . “ there was a wedding of some sheik or other . and you won ’ t believe what they wanted me to cook .” <PARA> i knew in my gut , in my gastronomic soul , that what i had long hoped was true . that it wasn ’ t just some wild traveler ’ s tale designed to stir the imagination and not the pot . the ultimate cookout was a reality . the only thing that could possibly be greater would be to spit - roast a giant squid . my wildest culinary dream could come true . sven , allah bless him and may his tribe increase , had done it . <PARA> “ i tell you no lie ,” he went on , sipping a cold one . “ they wanted camel . i roasted a whole camel on a spit .” <PARA> “ yes !” i cried . “ tell me everything .” and he did . he told me how he stuffed the camel with six sheep , stuffed the sheep with chickens , and the chickens with fish . he told me how it took 24 hours to cook , and that he served it on a silver platter in the shape of a recumbent camel . he related how the tribesmen who were the sheik ’ s guests then attacked it with their knives en masse , feasted with their bare hands , and ate the meat down to the ivory . <PARA> although sterling later wrote of having feasted on camel himself , the preparations he described were nothing like the infamously extravagant recipe of interest : <PARA> the whole village turned out , and it was said to be the most magnificant feast that anyone had ever attended . amdi ’ s mother supervised the preparation and sent [ the camel ] to us in many guises : roasted , stewed , grilled , braised with vegetables , made into soup . i stood by with a notebook , as mother directed her daughters and daughters - in - law , writing down the recipes . and the anticipation ! it was as savory as the meal itself . the ultimate cookout was happening before me , in the shadow of the sphinx , and in my honor no less . <PARA> mind you , there are actual ( non - camel ) dishes wherein different types of meat are stuffed into each other . the turducken is one such culinary adventure : a chicken stuffed into a duck stuffed into a turkey , all boneless . ( warning : although many have touted the turducken as a delicacy , one person of my acquaintance pronounced it “ bloody awful .” proceed at your own risk .) as for stuffed camel , we still haven ’ t decided whether it ’ s a real ( albeit uncommon ) dish , or merely a tall tale which middle easterners delight in foisting off on gullible tourists . <PARA> we ’ ll close by noting the similarity between the stuffed camel recipe and a joke about how to make elephant stew : <PARA> elephant stew <PARA> ingredients : <PARA> 1 elephant <PARA> 10 warthogs <PARA> 100 kilograms tomatoes <PARA> 1000 kilograms potatoes <PARA> 2 bags onions <PARA> 100 kilograms salt <PARA> 1 wheelbarrow onions ( heaped ) <PARA> 10 liters vinegar <PARA> 20 liters chutney <PARA> 4 guineafowl <PARA> preparation : <PARA> hunt the elephant , warthog and guineafowl . hang guineafowl to ripen . cut elephant into edible chunks ( will take about a month ). boil the warthog with other ingredients ( except guineafowl ) till nice and juicy . now boil elephant chunks over high flames till tender ( will take about 4 weeks ) and add everything together . boil for another 5 to 7 days . <PARA> produces about 3 , 500 helpings . <PARA> note : if the above isn ’ t enough , add the guineafowl as well . <PARA> ingredients : <PARA> 1 elephant <PARA> 10 warthogs <PARA> 100 kilograms tomatoes <PARA> 1000 kilograms potatoes <PARA> 2 bags onions <PARA> 100 kilograms salt <PARA> 1 wheelbarrow onions ( heaped ) <PARA> 10 liters vinegar <PARA> 20 liters chutney <PARA> 4 guineafowl <PARA> preparation : <PARA> hunt the elephant , warthog and guineafowl . hang guineafowl to ripen . cut elephant into edible chunks ( will take about a month ). boil the warthog with other ingredients ( except guineafowl ) till nice and juicy . now boil elephant chunks over high flames till tender ( will take about 4 weeks ) and add everything together . boil for another 5 to 7 days . <PARA> produces about 3 , 500 helpings . <PARA> note : if the above isn ’ t enough , add the guineafowl as well .

false	origins : the latter half of the message quoted above ( the portion beginning after the heading “ women united against war ”) is indeed the text of an on - line <PARA> petition started and signed by women opposed to any military action against iraq . however , the prelude , describing a walkout staged by 25 female members of the house of representatives during an 11 october 2002 vote on a resolution authorizing president bush to use military force against iraq , is fiction . no members of congress staged such a walkout , and there is no house member named barbara bell , from california or any other state . california is represented in congress by senator barbara boxer and representative barbara lee , and the latter ’ s web site explains the facts that were likely embellished in creating the introduction to this petition : <PARA> perhaps some of you have seen or heard of a false and misleading internet story claiming that “ barbara bell ” led a walkout of 25 congresswomen who refused to vote on the bush administration ’ s resolution authorizing the use of force against iraq . i want to make it clear that “ barbara bell ” is a fictional member of congress and that no such event ever occurred . <PARA> i , barbara lee , did offer an amendment in opposition to the bush resolution authorizing force against iraq and i have been a vocal opponent of the president ’ s doctrine of preemption and rush to war . i did not , however , lead or participate in any supposed walkout by women members . <PARA> as always , i thank you for contacting me and appreciate your interest in our continuing efforts to ensure a peaceful disarmament of any iraqi weapons of mass destruction . <PARA> i , barbara lee , did offer an amendment in opposition to the bush resolution authorizing force against iraq and i have been a vocal opponent of the president ’ s doctrine of preemption and rush to war . i did not , however , lead or participate in any supposed walkout by women members . <PARA> as always , i thank you for contacting me and appreciate your interest in our continuing efforts to ensure a peaceful disarmament of any iraqi weapons of mass destruction .	
true	origins : the substance of this petition is fairly accurate . on 19 january 2001 , 17 - year - old bariya ibrahim magazu ( whose name is rendered in e - mail as “ hariya ibrahim lagazu ”) was publicly flogged one hundred strokes with a cane for the crime of premarital sex . in september 2000 , her swelling belly served to condemn her : it provided incontrovertible proof that she had indeed engaged in this activity . she was charged and sentenced to receive 180 strokes of the cane once she ’ d recovered from the birth of her child , an event which took place in early december 2000 . <PARA> the original sentence of 180 lashes was reduced to 100 when the court which tried her case was <PARA> prevailed upon to drop the 80 lashes imposed for making unsubstantiated allegations against the men she named as her paramours . the 100 - lash sentence for engaging in premarital sex was upheld . it was carried out six - and - a - half weeks after she gave birth to her son . <PARA> although the e - mail lays the situation out as a straightforward case of rape , this can ’ t be asserted as accurate . at her trial ( where she was not represented by counsel , by the way ), magazu claimed she had been pressured into having sex with three middle - aged men from her village who were associates of her father . although coercion of this nature is reprehensible beyond my ability to express disgust , it ’ s not right to call it rape , a decidedly loaded word most people parse as a violent attack involving physical force and the immediate threat of serious bodily harm . <PARA> the pregnant teen produced seven witnesses who agreed with her claims . what form this agreement took is not known , nor is the strength of the evidence they gave . however , none of her witnesses had seen her have sex with any of the men , and sharia law decrees that four witnesses must be produced for such testimony to be taken as valid . <PARA> all three men named by magazu denied having had sexual relations with her . <PARA> the court ruled that magazu had not provided enough proof and found her guilty of sex before marriage and making unproven allegations against the men . ( had the court believed her , the men could have been convicted of adultery and stoned to <PARA> death .) <PARA> if she wasn ’ t forcibly raped , was she coerced ? that question is also unanswerable with the information at hand . a reporter from the toronto globe and mail traveled to the girl ’ s village to find out more , but she was prevented from having a real conversation with the 17 - year - old mother , however , she did pick up tales that were well - believed gossip in the village — magazu , it seems , was a rarity : a 17 - year - old who wasn ’ t married , in a community where every girl weds by 15 . the women say it was common knowledge that she had sex with men . in fact , there was a bit of a scandal a year ago , the gossips claim , when one of the men magazu said could have fathered her child essentially deserted his wife , spending all his free time with magazu . <PARA> was she voluntarily involved in the relationship that left her pregnant , or was that just village chin - wagging ? had she ( as has sometimes been asserted ) been persuaded into sexual relations with older men as a way of satisfying family debts ? no one will now say ; certainly not the girl herself , who maintains her pregnancy was “ a mere coincidence ,” something that she cannot explain . <PARA> bariya ibrahim magazu is now wed to a man from another village who took her as a second wife as an act of charity . <PARA> her sentence prompted an outcry from human rights groups . far from being swept under the rug , magazu ’ s story has repeatedly made the front pages . the united nations children ’ s fund ( unicef ) condemned the decision to flog magazu . the canadian high commission in the nigerian capital , abuja , delivered a diplomatic rebuke to the nigerian government . criticism of the nigerian government has been universal . <PARA> well , maybe not universal . protests from overseas have been vocal and strident . in nigeria , the response is best characterized as muted . nigerian president olusegun obasanjo has condemned the public flogging as conflicting with “ fundamental human rights ” but says he was powerless to stop it . <PARA> since nigeria returned to civilian rule last year , nine northern states have introduced ( or declared plans to introduce ) the strict islamic code known as the sharia . sharia — literally , “ the way ” — is a broad social and political framework muslims must live by . it ’ s a harsh code , but it is fundamental to their belief system . as for criticisms that the application of this code violates basic human rights , ahmed sani , the governor of zamfara , disagrees . any convention that says flogging or amputation violate human rights is inherently unsound , he said , and if freedom of religion is a fundamental human right , it cannot be negated by those who disagree with components of a faith <PARA> magazu was the first woman in modern times to be sentenced to a flogging in nigeria for having had premarital sex . it is unlikely she will be the last . <PARA> is it wrong to sentence a teenage girl to be publicly beaten for a violation of islamic strictures , possibly even one she played no willing part in ? we think so . but the nigerians do not . <PARA> barbara “ faith and justice : unbeatable ” mikkelson

false	origins : the most ( physically ) damaging aspect of prolonged power outages for the average citizen is food spoilage . perishable foods generally should be discarded after having been held unchilled for two hours or more , although modern refrigerators can usually keep them safely cool for up to about <PARA> five hours without power . fortunately , power outages of such duration are relatively uncommon ( and limited in area ) these days , but the august 2003 blackout of much of northeastern north america demonstrated that prolonged , widespread power outages are still very much a possibility . <PARA> usually food gone bad from a lack of electricity was pitched into the trash with a sigh and a groan ( and a trip to the grocery store quickly scheduled ), but these days more people are aware ( and taking advantage ) of power company offers to reimburse their customers for spoiled food products . hence the interest in a on - line form which conedison customers can fill out and submit to request up to $ 350 in reimbursement from the company for household food products spoiled by a power outage . <PARA> but even if the form is genuine , the idea that conedison customers can use it to obtain reimbursement for food spoiled during the august 2003 northeastern blackout is not . as the form states in its qualifying conditions : <PARA> the outage must have resulted from a failure in con edison ’ s local distribution system and must have lasted for more than 12 hours within a 24 - hour period . <PARA> although many conedison customers did experience power failures which lasted more than 12 hours , conedison maintains that the blackout did not come about “ from a failure in con edison ’ s local distribution system ,” and the terms of their compensation offer therefore do not apply : <PARA> “ it ’ s not true [ that we are reimbursing customers for spoiled food ]” said joe petta , a spokesman for consolidated edison inc . unit consolidated edison co . of new york inc . <PARA> “ there is a claim form on our web site , but it has always been there — we have said since day two ( of the blackout ) that we are not liable .” <PARA> con edison has said the blackout likely originated outside its service area . <PARA> petta said con edison , which provides power to more than nine million people in and around new york city , has been inundated with thousands of the spoiled food claim forms . <PARA> “ there is a claim form on our web site , but it has always been there — we have said since day two ( of the blackout ) that we are not liable .” <PARA> con edison has said the blackout likely originated outside its service area . <PARA> petta said con edison , which provides power to more than nine million people in and around new york city , has been inundated with thousands of the spoiled food claim forms . <PARA> the downloadable form now comes with a prepended page informing conedison customers that : <PARA> while we regret the inconvenience to our customers , the august 14 power disruption in new york city and westchester county was caused by events hundreds of miles away . under government regulations , con edison cannot be held responsible for legal claims stemming from food spoilage and other inconveniences . <PARA> pending a change in conedison ’ s policies ( or a new discovery regarding the cause of the blackout ), customers whose food spoiled during the blackout will have to deal with it the old - fashioned way : toss it in the garbage and start over .

false	origins : most missing child alerts circulated via e - mail fall into one of two categories : genuine reports of missing children that continue to be forwarded long after the child has been found , or hoaxes imploring readers to look for children who aren ’ t missing or don ’ t exist . the above - quoted message bears all the earmarks of the latter category . <PARA> the entreaty to help find carissa malanitch first reached us on 5 february 2009 . it was circulated primarily as a text message randomly sent to <PARA> cell phones in missouri , nevada , and utah , and included a photograph ( displayed above ) of a blonde girl sitting in a car . <PARA> none of the versions or descriptions of them subsequently received include even the most basic information one would expect to find in a genuine missing child plea : where carissa malanitch went missing , the date , time , and location where she was last seen , a physical description of her , a description of what she was last seen wearing , contact information for her parents , or contact information for the local police authorities handling the case . all that was provided was the information that the child ’ s mother “ works in the mall at the thai way express .” <PARA> the alert even included phrases taken word - for - word from previous missing child hoax e - mails , such as christopher john mineo , kelsey brooke jones , ashley flores , and evan trembley . <PARA> a variety of searches through news accounts and law enforcement and missing child web sites , including the site of the center for missing & exploited children ( ncmec ), failed to turn up mention of a missing girl named carissa malanitch . <PARA> the one piece of identifying information provided in the message , an e - mail address , produced a “ this user doesn ’ t have a yahoo . com account ” error when mail was sent to it on 10 february 2009 . said message is automatically generated by yahoo . com in response to e - mails sent to non - existent addresses . <PARA> that address has subsequently been registered , as this auto - reply generated from it on 11 february 2009 shows : <PARA> hello . this message is an auto - reply , from someone not related to miss malanitch . i read the story of the text message at the urban legends reference pages website , <URL> and decided to try registering the account . to my surprise , it was not already registered . please take the fact that this email account did not exist when the message was written as a sign that it is a hoax .	
false	origins : it ’ s hard not to be sympathetic to a plea to help find a missing child . the terror the parent is facing is unimaginable , and it strikes right to the hearts of all who receive the story . <PARA> there ’ s one problem with turning to the online community for help in locating a missing child : how do you then tell them the hunt is off ? <PARA> this case , the missing child was safely returned to her home two days after her 10 july 1998 disappearance . krystava had been taken by rebecca dearmond , the 18 - year - old girl in whose care she ’ d been left . at first rebecca claimed she thought she was supposed to be babysitting krystava until saturday and that it was all a misunderstanding . later she admitted she ’ d taken the child as a way of getting back at the child ’ s uncle , with whom she ’ d been having a relationship . felony charges of false imprisonment and depriving a mother of parental rights were laid against her . <PARA> all ’ s well that ends well . unfortunately , for the police it didn ’ t end for a long time . concerned phone calls about krystava continued to flood the city of mounds view police thanks to this cyber - plea for help . manpower that could have been going towards catching criminals and keeping other little kids safe was expended in explaining to caller after caller that the little girl had been returned unharmed and was now home . meanwhile , even as police were reassuring callers , concerned netizens continued to forward this plea to even wider circles of acquaintance , thereby setting up the mounds view police force to field even more inquiries . <PARA> if at this point you ’ re still tempted to see the problem as one of asking the police department to handle the occasional call or two about the case , consider this : according to a 30 april 1999 article in the minneapolis star tribune : “ the ramsey county sheriff ’ s office , which dispatches for mounds view , had 150 calls about the case last thursday [ april 22 ], some coming from as far away as israel and china . ‘ this is unreal ,’ mounds view lt . david brick said . ‘ if there was a way to stop it , we <PARA> would .'” <PARA> in the summer of 1999 , a full year after krystava was back from her two - day absence , the mounds view police department revamped its phone system to include a recorded message about the recovery of krystava patients schmidt . callers now have to first listen to this message before their calls are connected to the dispatcher . so far there has yet to have been a case of an emergency situation made worse by the caller first having to sit through a message about the found child , but it ’ s easy to see how such a delay in the wrong situation could have tragic consequences . <PARA> if you get a cybersolicitation to aid in the hunt for a missing child , still your natural desire to help long enough to first do a bit of checking . look to the national center for missing and exploited children ( ncmec ) for information about the child in question . if you don ’ t find the child listed on their pages , call them at 1 - 800 - the - lost and ask about the e - mail you ’ ve received . <PARA> we all want to make the world a better place , but sometimes in our haste to do so , we actually make it worse . think before you hit the “ forward to all ” button . <PARA> barbara “ sometimes it ’ s not the kid that ’ s missing , it ’ s the information ” mikkelson

false	origins : this request for business cards for a suffering youngster reached us in july 2008 . unlike some “ sick child asks for cards ” entreaties , this one was for real : there was such a child , and both his condition and request were as described . <PARA> brandon rayner of las vegas , nevada , was a ten - year - old brain tumor survivor . he also had leukemia , for which he was being treated at sunrise children ’ s hospital in <PARA> las vegas . <PARA> brandon had been collecting business cards for a couple of years simply because he found them interesting , but in 2008 decided he wanted to be included in the guinness world records annals as the holder of the record for the largest assemblage of these items . he had consequently asked that folks send him their business cards to aid in his quest . <PARA> the boy passed away on 24 december 2008 . at the time of his passing , he had amassed more than 900 , 000 cards . <PARA> an entity called the world records academy has awarded brandon recognition for the largest collection of business cards . <PARA> however , that the youngster wanted to establish a world record for this achievement doesn ’ t necessarily mean that guinness world records will honor the attempt and list it in its book even if the boy does manage to accumulate a gobsmackingly large stockpile of cards . guinness requires that those seeking to be recognized as record holders in any category register with it and fill out the proper forms as a first step in the vetting process . those looking to break existing records are then sent current record details and the relevant rules and guidelines , while the requests of those trying something that hasn ’ t been done before are forwarded to the company ’ s research department for review — first to determine if there ’ s interest in the new category , then to lay down the necessary guidelines for the try . <PARA> yet there is hope for the attempt . according to the las vegas review - journal , “ and though not official , a representative from guinness said the company is looking into creating a record for the largest business card collection . because no one currently has this record , brandon would be the one to beat .” <PARA> jo rayner , brandon ’ s mother , said she submitted the application to guinness at the beginning of september 2008 and is patiently waiting to hear back . <PARA> however , even if all the requisite paperwork hoops are jumped through , it ’ s unlikely guinness will want to involve itself in this try . it once allowed itself to be entangled in a similar record attempt concerning the accumulation of birthday cards , which led to the craig shergold fiasco in which a lad who ( then ) had cancer brought strife upon himself , his family , and even the children ’ s wish foundation via his desire to get into the record books . <PARA> while there is no official record for the most birthday cards received in a single year , craig shergold is believed to have received in the neighborhood of 250 million get - well cards across the span of his appeal ( although guinness world records retired that category in 1992 at 33 million after finding those kind of campaigns kept circulating long after the recipients wanted them to stop ). <PARA> as guiness has concluded , the danger with such entreaties is they don ’ t magically end when the need is fulfilled . the shergold family continued to receive an avalanche of cards even after it had repeatedly asked that folks cease forwarding them and eventually had to move because of the influx of well - intentioned mail . <PARA> guinness explains its position very clearly in the faq on its web site , saying of shergold record : <PARA> this record attempt has ceased . many years ago , a boy fighting cancer started a campaign for people to send him get - well messages in order to set a record for the most items received . not only was that boy successful in getting a mention in the 1991 edition of the guinness world records book , he also made a full recovery . <PARA> however , since then , chain mails have started up with variations on the original story , some requesting business cards or compliments slips rather than get - well messages . please don ’ t respond to any such requests , and if anyone asks you about it please tell them it ’ s a hoax ! <PARA> however , since then , chain mails have started up with variations on the original story , some requesting business cards or compliments slips rather than get - well messages . please don ’ t respond to any such requests , and if anyone asks you about it please tell them it ’ s a hoax ! <PARA> barbara “ card of hearing ” mikkelson

mixture	origins : on 18 april 2013 , the u . s . house of representatives ( but not yet the senate ) passed cyber intelligence sharing and protection act ( cispa ). the intent of cispa is to assist the federal government in combating threats from hackers and cybercriminals ( both in the u . s . and abroad ) by facilitating the voluntary sharing of information about internet users between the government and private companies . <PARA> critics of cispa content that the bill ’ s privacy protections are insufficient or nonexistent , particularly because it does not require the government to secure a warrant prior to <PARA> obtaining information on individuals ’ internet activity , nor does it allow internet users to hold companies that share their information with the government legally liable ( even though such sharing may violate those companies ’ stated privacy policies ). <PARA> mike rogers , a michigan representative and the house intelligence committee chairman , has been one of proponents of cispa , stating that “ people were stealing their identities , their accounts , their intellectual property , and subsequent to that , their jobs . [ users ] began to question the value of getting on internet and using [ it ] for commercial purposes . their trust in the free and open internet ... was at risk .” <PARA> colorado representative jared polis has been an outspoken critic of cispa , criticizing it as “ the biggest government takeover of personal information that i ’ ve seen during my time here in congress .” <PARA> the house intelligence committee has published a document entitled “ myths and facts about the cyber intelligence sharing and protection act ( cispa )” to counter criticisms of the bill . <PARA> cispa still has a ways to go before becoming enacted as law , as it must be passed by the senate and signed by president obama . neither is a slam dunk , as a similar cispa bill was passed by the house in 2012 but failed to clear the senate , and the office of management and budget issued a statement proclaiming that “ if the bill , as currently crafted , were presented to the president , his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill .”	
false	examples : [ collected on the internet , 2001 ] <PARA> origins : just about any unsourced list of witty observations about our politics and social mores gets credited to humorist george carlin these days , even when it doesn ’ t really sound like anything he would write . carlin may sometimes use the format of stringing together a few dozen pithy comments about a wide variety of topical subjects , but the tone of his humor is nothing like this reactionary piece . if any doubt remained , carlin himself swept it away by announcing on his web site that he is not the author of the <PARA> article . <PARA> if not carlin , then who did write it ? this piece has also been credited to a number of decidedly conservative , outspoken media figures , such as rock star ted nugent , talk radio host rush limbaugh , and other comedians , such as denis leary , but the even if the article might seem to echo the political opinions of these men , it doesn ’ t quite match any of them , nor does the language used sound quite right for any of these figures .

false	origins : an article published on the purported web site of “ youth leader tyson bowers iii ” on 4 april 2013 proclaimed that a south carolina couple had made “ national news ” by putting their 16 - year - old daughter up for adoption after learning she was gay because they “ don ’ t know how to handle someone who decides to live a lifestyle that we do not agree with ”: <PARA> a southern carolina couple have made national news by being the first parents to put their child up for adoption due to their sexuality . usually parents give up their children because they can ’ t raise them due to finances or because they are young and don ’ t have the mental ability to bring up a child . kids are also usually given up for adoption at a young age , but april chadwell is barely 16 years old and has been listed as legally adoptable by the state of southern carolina . mrs . chadwell released a statement saying “ it was a tough choice to give up our daughter to the state , but we don ’ t know how to handle someone who decides to live a lifestyle that we do not agree with ”. the chadwells said they had help from their local church , who prayed for weeks seeking guidance for the couple and came to the conclusion that it would be best to let the child go in hopes of being adopted by a gay friendly family . <PARA> tyson bowers iii is not a real person , however , but rather a pen name employed by bryan butvidas , one of the founders of the satirical web site christwire . org . the web site of the fictional tyson bowers iii is a repository for such outrage - provoking spoofs as “ kentucky man sues mother for not aborting him ” and “ african american scientists invent synthetic watermelon .” <PARA> as the new york times wrote of christwire in 2010 : <PARA> since 2008 , christwire . org has emerged as the leading internet site for ultraconservative christian news , commentary and weather reportage . <PARA> oh , by the way : christwire is all one big joke . <PARA> not the readership , but the content , the opinions and the fake authors who write the stuff . neither of the two founders is a conservative christian . they are just like - minded 28 - year - olds who met on the internet , have never seen each other in person , and until this week had never given their real identities to a reporter . <PARA> oh , by the way : christwire is all one big joke . <PARA> not the readership , but the content , the opinions and the fake authors who write the stuff . neither of the two founders is a conservative christian . they are just like - minded 28 - year - olds who met on the internet , have never seen each other in person , and until this week had never given their real identities to a reporter . <PARA> new york magazine also reported that the site ’ s founders “ write to see how far we can get people to believe our nonsense ”: <PARA> christwire owners bryan butvidas and kirwin watson , after fielding press queries and book offers for months , have finally decided to go public . in an interview with new york , butvidas said the site ’ s basic concept is to <PARA> “ see what glenn beck is talking about and then make it ten times worse .” <PARA> “ we ’ re not trying to promote hate , we want to show how fake the world really is ,” he said . “ we write to see how far we can get people to believe our nonsense . people believe anything they read on the internet .” do readers get the joke ? just like with the media , not always . butyidas , who usually pens columns under the name tyson bowers iii , said some of the people who leave vituperative comments don ’ t get the irony . <PARA> “ people have these preconceived notions about how certain people are supposed to act , so if a conservative christian has a website , there are certain things you expect to see ,” he said . “ no matter how many times you say it ’ s satire , people will still buy it .” <PARA> “ see what glenn beck is talking about and then make it ten times worse .” <PARA> “ we ’ re not trying to promote hate , we want to show how fake the world really is ,” he said . “ we write to see how far we can get people to believe our nonsense . people believe anything they read on the internet .” do readers get the joke ? just like with the media , not always . butyidas , who usually pens columns under the name tyson bowers iii , said some of the people who leave vituperative comments don ’ t get the irony . <PARA> “ people have these preconceived notions about how certain people are supposed to act , so if a conservative christian has a website , there are certain things you expect to see ,” he said . “ no matter how many times you say it ’ s satire , people will still buy it .”

false	it seems that the mom and the boyfriend had been leaving this child alone all day long with a glass of milk and a bowl of chicken nuggets while they went off to school . <PARA> because this darling child went to the bathroom on the floor , 15 year old <PARA> daddy - wanna - be beat her severely . <PARA> he is facing less than 5 years because of his age . this is not a small “ boy ”. he is rather a good sized kid whom one would think was 18 – 19 years old . this child was a small child . standing up she may have come to just above his knee in height . <PARA> when this reaches 500 please to the person who is 500 , email this to me at <PARA> nascarfan_2006 <USER> <PARA> please no fake names ... this is serious ! <PARA> dear mr . fitzpatrick , <PARA> as tax paying citizens , we demand that the 15 year old boy , anthony weakfall , that killed 20 month old imani jennings be tried as an adult . he beat this innocent baby for over an hour .... he had to have known how hurt she was when he left her to go to school . he deserves 25 years to life .... not the “ be out in 4 years ” crap that you guys are going after . he took a life with no remorse .... he showed this baby no mercy , why should we show him any ? do you people understand that he beat this baby so bad that her own mother didn ’ t even recognize her ? do you understand the pain and horror that this baby had lived with everyday ??? the police and investigators were coming out of the house with tears streaming down their faces ..... and you still want him to have youthful offender because he is 15 ? he is old enough to know right from wrong and he is old enough to know that beating a baby like he did would end in her death . i am going to start a petition to demand that this “ kid ” serve the time he deserves and carries the stigma of being a baby killer for the rest of his life . the probability of him committing another violent crime if he is granted youthful offender is very high . please , reconsider .... give mr . weakfall the adult trial he deserves and give baby imani the justice she deserves !! <PARA> origins : on 21 november 2008 , the body of 20 - month - old imani jennings was discovered by her mother , 18 - year - old cherron patterson , who came home around 3 p . m . and found that her child had been beaten so severely that she was almost <PARA> unrecognizable . <PARA> authorities maintained that her killer was 15 - year - old anthony weakfall jr ., the boyfriend of the mother , whom they said beat imani for nearly an hour with a metal rod , a cable cord , bedsprings , and his fists after the child experienced a potty - training accident , then left imani for dead as he headed off to school . <PARA> according to news reports on the case , imani jennings ’ abuse did not begin and end on the day of her death . those accounts stated that for the three weeks prior to imani ’ s murder , her mother and her mother ’ s boyfriend would leave her alone in a second - floor apartment for six to eight hours at a time , putting out a bowl of chicken nuggets and a glass of milk for her eat while they were gone . imani ’ s mother and her mother ’ s boyfriend routinely beat her with a variety of implements for having potty training accidents , the press reported . both old and fresh blood spots from the child were reportedly found spattered on all the walls of the apartment where the family lived . <PARA> weakfall was charged with second - degree murder , and because of his age he automatically qualified for juvenile offender status . an adult convicted on that charge would face a minimum sentence of 15 to 25 years with a maximum of life , but a juvenile offender would face a minimum penalty for his crime of between 7 - 1 / 2 to 15 years with a maximum of life . the e - mail ’ s claims that “[ weakfall ] is facing less than 5 years because of his age ” or that he will “ be out in 4 years ” were therefore incorrect . <PARA> imani ’ s mother , cherron patterson , was charged with second - degree assault and endangering the welfare of a child after she also admitted to having beaten <PARA> imani . <PARA> day care worker diane shakir was charged with failure to report suspected child abuse ( a misdemeanor ) and had her day care license revoked . imani jennings had been coming to shakir ’ s day care during the fall of 2008 , and three weeks prior to the child ’ s murder , shakir had taken photographs of the child ’ s injuries and confronted cherron patterson with them , asking what was going on . that was the last day imani was seen at that day care . child care workers are required by law to report cases of suspected abuse . <PARA> the petition to have anthony weakfall tried as an adult rather than as a juvenile was directed to onondaga county district attorney bill fitzpatrick . in response to it , he posted the following message on his web site : <PARA> let me make the following comments on the points raised by the author and apparently adopted by the signators . <PARA> 1 . the defendant anthony weakfall is presumed innocent . any death of a child , particularly a death by homicidal means , is heartbreaking . our constitution , however , does not distinguish between the right to a fair trial for defendants charged with mundane crimes as opposed to serious crimes . emotional responses in the public forum to an alleged crime serve no purpose other than to prejudice a jury pool and make my office ’ s job more difficult to bring an accused to justice . <PARA> 2 . everyone who signs this “ petition ” will likely be excused from ever sitting as a juror on the case . <PARA> 3 . the e - mail author opines “ he deserves 25 years to life ... not the “ be out in 4 years ” crap that you guys are going after .” i have no idea where this came from , and i doubt the e - mail author does either . let ’ s get some facts straight . mr . weakfall is charged with murder in the second degree ( a 15 year old cannot be charged with murder in the first degree ) as a “ juvenile offender .” this is not the equivalent of “ youthful offender .” in 1978 , responding to a rash of juvenile violence , the nys legislature made it possible for certain 13 , 14 and 15 year olds to be tried in adult court for “ designated juvenile offenses ,” murder in the second degree being one of them . the only difference distinguishing mr . weakfall from an adult in similar circumstances is the potential punishment he faces should he be convicted of murder . an adult would be facing a life sentence with a minimum ranging anywhere from 15 to 25 years . mr . weakfall , on the other hand , as a “ juvenile offender ,” is also facing a life sentence but with a minimum ranging anywhere from 71 ⁄ 2 to 15 years .

false	warnings about facebook “ pirates ” who copy other users ’ profiles began circulating widely on that social media site in december 2012 and have reappeared periodically since then : <PARA> it is true in a general sense that some scammers have engaged in facebook cloning , a process in which the scammer creates a new facebook account using a profile picture and similar name taken from an existing user , then sends out friend requests which appear to originate from that user . ( the requests often claim the sender has just set up a new facebook account or was locked out of his previous account .) the end purpose of such scams varies : it may be to send facebook users links to malicious websites that propagate malware , to perpetrate phishing schemes , or to collect personal information from users that can be used for identity theft . <PARA> however , contrary to the example texts reproduced above , facebook cloning is not a “ new scam ,” nor is there any evidence that its occurrence has increased greatly in recent days . ( it also isn ’ t a “ hack ,” as the scam requires no special privileges nor breaking in to any facebook accounts to accomplish .) <PARA> in general , facebook users should always be cautious with friend requests : attempt to verify their validity before accepting them , be wary of additional requests from persons you have already befriended , and take care about what information you share with friends on facebook .	
mixture	examples : [ collected via e - mail , january 2013 ] <PARA> they just made an announcement that starting sunday , when you use <PARA> your debit / atm card if you do not put in your pin ( atm ) you will be <PARA> charged 4 % from the visa mastercard company . don ’ t know how it will work <PARA> with credit card , but the 4 % is per swipe . so you guys might want to ditch <PARA> the credit cards , think about how many times a month you use it , 4 % x ? <PARA> can you afford it . this is part of some lawsuit they had where the <PARA> merchant was charged , but now it is directly on you . the stores will post <PARA> who is doing this and who is not . but bring cash or use your pin for your <PARA> atm card . this is not the time to be adding to the bill . <PARA> origins : although many customers are not aware of the practice , issuers of credit cards such as visa and mastercard charge merchants what are known as interchange fees for accepting purchases made with those credit cards . interchange fees typically range from between 1 . 5 % to 3 . 0 % of the total transaction amount . <PARA> until recently , merchants have been prohibited from passing along the costs of those interchange fees to customers who use credit cards by charging them higher prices ( although some merchants have skirted the concept by offering discounts to customers who pay in cash ). however , <PARA> due to a recent court case , beginning on 27 january 2013 merchants in many states will be allowed to pass along the cost of those interchange fees to their customers through the imposition of a checkout fee . <PARA> it isn ’ t true , however , that every customer who uses a visa or mastercard credit card will be now paying an extra 4 % at the cash register for every purchase . the passing along of interchange fees to customers isn ’ t automatic ; it ’ s up to each merchant to decide whether or not to charge a checkout fee . also , merchants will only be allowed to charge a fee that is equivalent to what they must pay for accepting a credit card , which as noted above is typically between 1 . 5 % and 3 % of the total transaction amount . the 4 % figure is the maximum checkout fee merchants may charge , even if their interchange fees are greater than that . <PARA> there are some other restrictions on checkout fees : they are permitted only on credit and charge cards , not debit cards ; merchants must provide customers with “ clear disclosure ” notices ( at store entrances , at the point of checkout , and on receipts ) of any checkout fees , and checkout fees may not be assessed in the ten states ( california , colorado , connecticut , florida , kansas , maine , massachusetts , new york , oklahoma and texas ) that prohibit them .

false	origins : pez began in 1927 as an austrian manufacturer and vendor of compressed peppermint tablets ( hence its name , taken from pfefferminz , the german word for “ peppermint ”). now , of course , <PARA> pez is an international business known not just for its fruit - flavored candy tablets , but for the ubiquitous , brightly - colored molded plastic dispensers sold with them . <PARA> initially , pez dispensers resembled cigarette lighters , befitting pez ’ s market position as a breath mint for adult smokers rather than a candy . when pez inventor edward haas brought his product to the american market in 1952 , sales were less than encouraging , so he made a couple of key changes intended to appeal to children : pez became fruit - flavored ( cherry , lemon , orange and strawberry ), and the dispensers were topped with the heads of cartoon characters , animals , circus figures , and other kiddie favorites . pez thus became more than just a candy company : they were transformed into a de facto manufacturer of specialized toys — toys purchased not only by candy - gulping children , but avidly sought after by collectors of all ages . <PARA> over the years , pez dispensers have been fashioned after a wide variety of cartoon <PARA> characters ( bugs bunny , peanuts , the flintstones ), comic book superheroes ( batman , spider - man ), movie favorites ( star wars ), and various animals . <PARA> rarely have pez dispensers featured real people , however ; when humans have been depicted , they have generally been either fictional characters ( such as santa claus ) or generic representations of roles ( such as a fireman or pilot ). the initial exceptions came in 1976 , when pez distributed a special series of nine dispensers based on an american history theme to coincide with the bicentennial of the united states . <PARA> the bi - centennial pez dispensers were also primarily generic representations of types ( indian chief , wounded soldier ) and fictional characters ( uncle sam ). but despite what was claimed in a popular trivia item afterwards , the series also included dispensers representing not just one , but three real people : legendary flag - maker betsy ross , frontiersman daniel boone , and celebrated revolutionary war figure paul revere .

false	so , if 1 / 3 of the states ( 17 ) do not cast their electoral college votes – then it goes to the house of representatives ( not the senate ) to elect the next president . <PARA> origins : as generations of american school children have been taught in civics / government classes , although all eligible citizens throughout the united states may participate in the voting to select the person who shall hold the office of president of the united states , they do not directly elect the president . instead , the residents of each state vote for a slate of electors equal in number to the members of their state ’ s congressional delegation ; those electors ( currently 538 in number ) cast ballots designating their choice of candidate for the presidency ( a process known as the electoral college ), and whichever candidate receives a majority of those 538 electoral votes becomes president . if no candidate receives a majority of electoral votes , then the house of representatives votes to select a president from the top three candidates . the latter circumstance is quite rare , however : only twice in u . s . history , and not since 1824 , has the house of representatives been called upon to choose a president . <PARA> in november 2012 , wnd published an article (“ how obama can be stopped in electoral college ”) by judson phillips , founder of tea party nation , suggesting a way in which the electoral college process could be circumvented to prevent president obama ’ s re - election and instead install mitt romney as president : one - third of the state electors could simply refuse to cast electoral college ballots , thereby throwing the selection of the next president to the house of representatives . since republicans will control a majority of state delegations in the house during the next congress , surely they would vote to elect the republican candidate , mitt romney , over democrat barack obama : <PARA> according to the 12th amendment , for the electoral college to be able to select the president , it must have a quorum of two - thirds of the states voting . if enough states refuse to participate , the electoral college will not have a quorum . if the electoral college does not have a quorum or otherwise cannot vote or decide , then the responsibility for selecting the president and vice president devolves to the congress . <PARA> the house of representatives selects the president and the senate selects the vice president . <PARA> since the republicans hold a majority in the house , presumably they would vote for mitt romney , and the democrats in the senate would vote for joe biden for vice president . <PARA> can this work ? <PARA> sure it can . <PARA> the house of representatives selects the president and the senate selects the vice president . <PARA> since the republicans hold a majority in the house , presumably they would vote for mitt romney , and the democrats in the senate would vote for joe biden for vice president . <PARA> can this work ? <PARA> sure it can . <PARA> this article was poorly researched and flat out wrong , an erroneous assumption based upon a misreading of the 12th amendment which put the cart before the horse . <PARA> the 12th amendment to the constitution doesn ’ t state that congress “ must have a quorum of two - thirds of the states voting for the electoral college to be able to select the president .” it directs <PARA> that if the selection of president has already devolved upon the house of representatives because no candidate received a majority of electoral votes , then “ a quorum consist [ ing ] of a member or members from two - thirds of the states ” is necessary before the house can begin to vote . in other words , the 12th amendment doesn ’ t say that electors from two - thirds of the states must participate in electoral college voting for the results to be valid ; it says that members of the house of representatives from two - thirds of the states have to be present in order to select a president if the electoral college has already failed to do so . <PARA> moreover , the scheme described above includes a couple of implicit errors . members of the house of representatives do not cast ballots individually for president ; they vote as part of state delegations , with each state having one vote . therefore , whichever party controls the majority of seats in the house is not guaranteed a victory in such a process ; what ’ s important is which party controls a majority of state delegations in the house . additionally , the current composition of the house is irrelevant , as the new congress to be seated in january 2013 would select a president if no candidate who ran in the november 2012 election received a majority of electoral votes . <PARA> it has happened from time to time that “ faithless ” electors have cast ballots for candidates other than the ones they were pledged to support in the electoral college ( although many are now prohibited from doing so by state laws ), but electors pledged to a losing candidate can ’ t do an end run around the electoral college process simply by refusing to vote at all .	
false	origins : americans love their snacks , and few snacks are more popular than hostess twinkies . twinkies are cream - filled sponge cakes <PARA> shaped like ladyfingers which pack 160 calories per cake . yet for all their nutritional drawbacks twinkies are a hugely popular treat in the usa , with 500 million of these confections baked each year . <PARA> because these cellophane - wrapped snack cakes are always to be found on the shelves at supermarkets and corner stores and always appear to feel fresh and spongy to the touch , a long - lived myth has sprung up to account for the continual presence of seemingly always - fresh twinkies . according to lore , twinkies have multi - year shelf lives and remain edible for decades ; this incredible longevity , rumor says , is due to twinkies not actually being food but rather some strange type of artificial , manufactured item shaped and flavored to resemble a cake - like offering . <PARA> through the years many of our readers have asked us about this baked product . each had heard a version of the basic twinkies legend about unbelievable shelf life brought about through some form of artificial production , either in the ingredients or the manufacturing process used . we ’ ve seen claims that twinkies : <PARA> as always , the truth is far less exciting than the lore . <PARA> twinkies were created in 1930 as ladyfinger - shaped spongecakes enrobing a banana filling at the hostess bakery in schiller park , illinois . ( hostess is now owned by kansas city - based interstate bakeries corp .) the product ’ s name was inspired by a billboard in st . louis advertising twinkle toe shoes . when the world ’ s banana trade ground to a halt during world war ii ( this wasn ’ t the first time war disrupted the banana trade — the popular ditty “ yes , we have no bananas ” came out of world war i because of similar circumstances ), hostess substituted a vanilla cream filling not dissimilar to cake <PARA> frosting . <PARA> twinkies have a shelf life of twenty - five days , not seven years , and certainly not fifty years . even so , twenty - five days is an unusually long time for a baked product to stay fresh . the secret to twinkies ’ longevity is their lack of dairy ingredients : because dairy products are not part of the formula , twinkies spoil much more slowly than other bakery items . <PARA> after the baking process of the sponge cake portion is completed , cream filling is injected into each twinkie through three holes in its top ( brown ) side ; the product is then flipped before packaging , turning its bottom into its top . hostess estimates it uses eight million pounds of sugar , seven million pounds of flour , and one million eggs to produce the 500 million twinkies baked every year . <PARA> twinkies gained notoriety in american jurisprudence in 1979 when the media widely misreported the claim that dan white , on trial for shooting san francisco mayor george moscone and city supervisor harvey milk , asserted that his consumption of junk foods such as twinkies “ had left him with diminished capacity for reason .” <PARA> according to hostess , it takes forty - five seconds to explode a twinkie in a microwave . <PARA> barbara “ and far less than forty - five for your mother to pitch a fit over it ” mikkelson

66 , then as a mormon missionary in france from mid - 1966 through the end of 1968 . <PARA> mitt romney served as a mormon missionary in france for a thirty - month period from july 1966 to december 1968 . in 2007 the new york times reported of his experience there that : <PARA> france was a humbling experience for mr . romney , who recalled it as the only time in his life when “ most of what i was trying to do was rejected .” <PARA> missionary work is a rite of passage for mormon men , who are encouraged to volunteer when they turn 19 . mitt romney ’ s grandfather , father and older brother had all served in britain , so his assignment to france “ came as a surprise ,” he recalled . <PARA> the son of a car company chief executive who later became governor of michigan , mitt romney called his mission an “ instructive ” first experience of deprivation . he lived on about $ 100 a month , sleeping on cast -

time clergy . members in good standing take turns serving in leadership roles . they are expected to perform their ecclesiastical duties on top of career and family responsibilities . those called to serve as stake presidents and bishops , or leaders of local wards , are fully empowered as agents of the church , and they carry great authority over their domains . mitt romney first took on a major church role around 1977 , when he was called to be a counselor to gordon williams , then the president of the boston stake . romney was essentially an adviser and deputy to williams , helping oversee area congregations . his appointment was somewhat unusual in that counselors at that level have typically been bishops of their local wards first . but romney , who was only about 30 years old , was deemed to possess leadership qualities beyond his years . romney ’ s responsibilities only grew from there ; he would go on to serve as bishop and then as stake president , overseeing about a dozen congregations with close to 4 , 000 members altogether . those positions in the church amounted to his biggest leadership test yet , exposing him to personal and institutional crises , human tragedies , immigrant cultures , social forces , and organizational challenges that he had never before encountered . <PARA> mitt romney served as the president and ceo of the salt lake organizing committee for the olympic and paralympic winter games of 2002 . according to his spokesman , romney donated the salary and severance pay he received for that effort to charity : <PARA> in romney ’ s case , he signed an offer letter in 1999 acknowledging he would be paid $ 280 , 000 annually for the olympic job and receive up to one year in severance pay after the games . romney announced the day he started the job that he would not accept any wages unless the organizing committee completed the games with a profit . he also told the salt lake tribune one of his “ absolutes ” was that he would “ not accept any severance pay when his three - year term is complete .” he also cited his pledge to forgo any severance pay in his book , “ turnaround : crisis , leadership , and the olympic games .” <PARA> when the organizing committee posted a surplus of nearly $ 100 million after the games , romney accepted $ 922 , 980 in total salary as well as the $ 476 , 000 severance package .

unproven	origins : sometimes tracking down the origins of various anecdotes which come our way is a simple task — a matter of sending an inquiry via e - mail , making a confirmatory phone call , or plucking a book or two from the shelf — and sometimes it ’ s a deceptively difficult one . this entry definitely fits into the latter category . <PARA> at first blush the account quoted above would seem like an easy one to verify : it involves a well - known personage ( fiorello la guardia , who served an unprecedented three terms as mayor of new york from 1934 to 1945 ), deals with a rather unusual and politically newsworthy event , and relates a story supposedly reported in new york city newspapers ( of which there were several at the time ). piece of <PARA> cake . <PARA> er , not quite . the expected sources we checked — la guardia biographies and new york city newspapers from january 1935 — contained nothing even vaguely similar to this anecdote . a lack of contemporary or historical documentation is generally a good indicator of the apocryphality of this type of story , but since absence of evidence isn ’ t necessarily evidence of absence , we considered a few other possibilities and continued the pursuit . <PARA> perhaps la guardia ’ s various biographers didn ’ t come across this story or didn ’ t consider it significant enough to include in their works , and perhaps the date given in the version quoted above ( january 1935 ) was erroneous . so , we tried tracking the story backwards instead ; finding a recently published version of the story might provide some clues about where it came from . <PARA> a quick web search turned up an identically - worded version of this anecdote in brennan manning ’ s book ragamuffin gospel ( 2000 ), so we headed out to a local bookstore to check it out . fortunately , that store had the book in stock ; we found a copy on the shelf , located the anecdote of interest within it , checked the endnotes for the corresponding chapter , and found that manning ’ s source was . . . another book . luck was with us that day , however , for the same store also had a copy of that other book , say please , say thank you : the respect we owe one another ( 1999 ) by donald w . mccullough . our luck ran out there , though , as the endnotes indicated mccullough ’ s source for the la guardia anecdote was an out - of - print book , best sermons 1 ( 1988 ). <PARA> gratification was merely delayed , not denied , by this stumbling block . although none of our local libraries possessed a copy , used book resources are plentiful on the web ; within a week we had a copy of best sermons 1 in our hands , where we found a quite similar version of the la guardia anecdote within a sermon entitled “ the righteous and the good ” by one james n . mccutcheon . but sermons don ’ t usually include footnotes ( and this one was no exception ), so we still had nothing to help us determine where the story might have come from originally . <PARA> a short biographical sketch accompanying the sermon informed us that james n . mccutcheon was ( at the time the book was published ) senior minister of wayzata community church in wayzata , minnesota , so we tried looking him up via an on - line phone directory and got a hit . alas , when we called the phone number provided by the directory , we found that it was no longer in service . undaunted , we called the wayzata community church and learned that rev . mccutcheon had since retired and moved out of state ; after we explained our interest in tracking him down , they cautiously gave us his new address . that address information was enough for us to find a current phone listing for him , and in the interests of urban legendry i gave him a call at home one evening . <PARA> rev . mccutcheon was taken aback at first that someone he ’ d never heard of was calling him out of the blue to ask about the source of an anecdote he ’ d used in the middle of a sermon over fifteen years earlier , but once i explained who i was and what i was trying to accomplish , he was quite polite and eager to be helpful . we talked at length , but the gist of the conversation was that he ’ d read the la guardia anecdote somewhere and used it in a sermon , but he no longer remembered where he ’ d read it and had long since discarded or misplaced his notes . ( he was adamant that he hadn ’ t made the story up , and i reassured him that that thought had never crossed my mind .) <PARA> we were back to square one . combing through la guardia biographies again , we did find that new york mayors were empowered to act as magistrates in those days , a right la guardia exercised on more than one occasion . la guardia ’ s most recent biographer , alyn brodsky , noted : <PARA> on occasion , la guardia would don judicial robes and take to the bench in magistrate ’ s court , a prerogative to which his office as the city ’ s chief magistrate entitled him . a bus driver went through a red light when la guardia happened to be on the scene . he noted the license number , had the offender hauled before him , and imposed — and collected on the spot — a two - dollar fine . <PARA> and lawrence elliott , author of little flower : the life and times of fiorello la guardia , wrote : <PARA> an obscure statute empowered new york ’ s mayors to sit as judges ; none of them had ever paid the slightest attention to it . but at 8 : 30 one morning , la guardia walked into the west 100th street police station , told the dumbstruck magistrate to go find a seat in the courtroom , and himself sat down to preside at the bar of justice . it was a hard day for pimps and gamblers . <PARA> one defendant , charged with operating a string of slot machines , stepped up confident of receiving the usual admonition or , at worst , a fine . la guardia sent him to jail . later , to underscore the point , he posed for press photographers wearing a menacing scowl and holding a sledgehammer poised over a heap of slot machines about to be dumped into the east river . <PARA> one defendant , charged with operating a string of slot machines , stepped up confident of receiving the usual admonition or , at worst , a fine . la guardia sent him to jail . later , to underscore the point , he posed for press photographers wearing a menacing scowl and holding a sledgehammer poised over a heap of slot machines about to be dumped into the east river . <PARA> we seemed to be on the right track , but we were still missing any accounts matching the specifics of our story . we turned to the newspapers again , this time searching the new york times historical database for any articles mentioning ‘ la guardia ’ ( or ‘ laguardia ’) and ‘ magistrate .’ the first hit , from february 1934 , sounded like a match for the occasion described by elliott above : <PARA> mayor laguardia dashed up the steps of the west 100th street police station late yesterday afternoon , threw open the door and strode angrily inside . <PARA> “ as you were !” he snapped to the policemen who jumped to attention . he threw aside his black felt hat and black overcoat with determined gestures . his unruly black hair tumbling down over his forehead and his black eyes flashing fire , he crossed the room quickly and seated himself behind the big oaken desk where the lieutenant usually presides . police commissioner o ’ ryan , who had been waiting , sat alongside . the police on duty stood about the walls , looking solemn and unhappy . <PARA> “ as you were !” he snapped to the policemen who jumped to attention . he threw aside his black felt hat and black overcoat with determined gestures . his unruly black hair tumbling down over his forehead and his black eyes flashing fire , he crossed the room quickly and seated himself behind the big oaken desk where the lieutenant usually presides . police commissioner o ’ ryan , who had been waiting , sat alongside . the police on duty stood about the walls , looking solemn and unhappy . <PARA> however , the article described la guardia ’ s hearing only a single case — that of a woman arrested in her husband ’ s store and charged with having a slot machine in her possession — and implied that the mayor had deliberately chosen in advance to act as magistrate in that one specific case ( because he was engaged in a battle with racketeers to wipe out the proliferation of illegal slot machines in new york ). the article made no mention of a “ tattered old woman ” accused of stealing a loaf of bread , nor even the “ pimps and gamblers ” of elliott ’ s version . ( the sole defendant was let go in her husband ’ s custody on her promise to pay $ 5 bail , “ the lowest that could be fixed under the law ”; she was not “ sent to jail ,” as elliott wrote .) <PARA> the only other article would could find describing la guardia ’ s acting as a magistrate came a few months later , in july 1934 , when the mayor sat “ on the jefferson market court bench from 9 : 55 a . m . to 2 : 30 p . m ., with no time out for lunch .” however , the only cases specifically mentioned were those of a bartender who served a plainclothes policeman two drinks after the legal closing hour , eight bootblacks who had been “ plying their trade in a restricted area ,” some “ pretzel peddlers ” who received a day in jail for unspecified reasons , five women who had been engaged in a “ clothes - line fight ” ( whom la guardia sent home because the weather was “ too hot to fight ”), and a man held for violating the sullivan law ( i . e ., carrying pistols without a permit ). la guardia was quoted afterwards as saying that he planned to spend a day in magistrate ’ s court in each of the city ’ s five boroughs within the next few weeks , but we couldn ’ t find any news reports indicating that he ever did so . <PARA> that left us with a choice between the possibility that the anecdote was apocryphal and the possibility that it was true but the new york times didn ’ t report it . to ensure we hadn ’ t missed anything ( perhaps the story was somehow reported without use of the word ‘ magistrate ’), we searched every new york times article published between january and march of 1935 that included la guardia ’ s name in the text . ( we used that wide range of dates because even though the version of the anecdote quoted at the head of this page makes reference to january 1935 , the sermon we tracked it back to says only that the incident in question took place “ one bitter cold winter ’ s night in 1935 .”) none of the articles related anything other than standard governmental business , save for one that noted the mayor spent a quiet new year ’ s eve at home after attending a performance of “ la boheme ,” and another that reported he took in a concert at the metropolitan museum of art on january 19 . <PARA> after we exhausted this avenue of approach , a reader pointed us to a source we had on hand but hadn ’ t thought to check , one of publisher bennett cerf ’ s many collections of humorous anecdotes . it didn ’ t provide any more detail to help verify the story , but it did demonstrate that the story was around while mayor la guardia was still in office : <PARA> mayor laguardia , the present incumbent , rates a whole book for himself , but as long as he ’ s mayor of the town we all work in , i ’ d better be careful . besides , he officiated at my marriage , and i owe him a debt of gratitude . he whipped through the ceremony in three seconds flat , mumbled , “ don ’ t blame me for anything that happens ,” and was off — probably to attend a fire . here ’ s one nice story about him . he presides occasionally at police court . one bitter cold day they brought a trembling old man before him , charged with stealing a loaf of bread . “ i ’ ve got to punish you , declared laguardia . “ the law makes no exception . i can do nothing but sentence you to a fine of ten dollars .” <PARA> but the little flower was reaching into his pocket as he added , “ well , here ’ s the ten dollars to pay your fine . and now i remit the fine .” he tossed a ten - dollar bill into his famous sombrero . “ furthermore ,” he declared , “ i ’ m going to fine everybody in this courtroom fifty cents for living in a town where a man has to steal bread in order to eat . mr . bailiff , collect the fines and give them to this defendant !” the hat was passed and an incredulous old man , with a light of heaven in his eyes , left the courtroom with a stake of forty - seven dollars and fifty cents . <PARA> but the little flower was reaching into his pocket as he added , “ well , here ’ s the ten dollars to pay your fine . and now i remit the fine .” he tossed a ten - dollar bill into his famous sombrero . “ furthermore ,” he declared , “ i ’ m going to fine everybody in this courtroom fifty cents for living in a town where a man has to steal bread in order to eat . mr . bailiff , collect the fines and give them to this defendant !” the hat was passed and an incredulous old man , with a light of heaven in his eyes , left the courtroom with a stake of forty - seven dollars and fifty cents . <PARA> we ’ re still lacking any convincing proof that this might be anything other than a charming yet fictitious anecdote , but we ’ re not quite ready to throw in the towel and declare it false yet . <PARA> in 2012 , we received the following odd variation of the la guardia legend : <PARA> an indonesian judge by the name of marzuki was sitting in judgment of an old lady who pleaded guilty of stealing some tapioca from a plantation . in her defense , she admitted to the judge that she was indeed guilty of the crime because she was poor and her son was sick while her grandchild was hungry . <PARA> the plantation manager insisted that she be punished as a deterrent to others . the judge going through the documents then looked up and said to the old lady , “ i ’ m sorry but i cannot make any exception to the law and you must be punished .” the old lady was fined rp . 1 million ( usd 100 ) and if she could not pay the fine then she will be jailed for 2 and a half years as demanded by the law . <PARA> she wept as she could not pay the fine . the judge then took off his hat and put in rp . 1 million into the hat and said “ in the name of justice , i fine all who are in the court rp . 50 thousand ( usd 5 . 50 ) as dwellers of this city for letting a child to starve until her grandmother has to steal to feed her grandchild . the registrar will now collect the fines from all present .” the court managed to collect rp 3 . 5 million ( usd 200 ) whereby once the fine was paid off , the rest was given to the old lady – including the fine collected from the plantation manager . <PARA> the plantation manager insisted that she be punished as a deterrent to others . the judge going through the documents then looked up and said to the old lady , “ i ’ m sorry but i cannot make any exception to the law and you must be punished .” the old lady was fined rp . 1 million ( usd 100 ) and if she could not pay the fine then she will be jailed for 2 and a half years as demanded by the law . <PARA> she wept as she could not pay the fine . the judge then took off his hat and put in rp . 1 million into the hat and said “ in the name of justice , i fine all who are in the court rp . 50 thousand ( usd 5 . 50 ) as dwellers of this city for letting a child to starve until her grandmother has to steal to feed her grandchild . the registrar will now collect the fines from all present .” the court managed to collect rp 3 . 5 million ( usd 200 ) whereby once the fine was paid off , the rest was given to the old lady – including the fine collected from the plantation manager .	
false	no two works have had a greater influence on the “ monster ” genre of popular culture than mary shelley ’ s frankenstein ( 1818 ) and bram stoker ’ s dracula ( 1897 ). the archetypal characters introduced in these novels — the frankenstein monster and count dracula the vampire — have suffused popular culture through hundreds of films , television programs , books , and other media , featuring in works as diverse as the chillingly stark silent film nosferatu to the cheerily silly sitcom the munsters . <PARA> it ’ s often the case , however , that aspects of such original works become obscured by the innumerable derivatives they spawn : elements enter the popular “ lore ” of a genre not because they were present in the progenitor work , but because they were introduced somewhere along the line in films , plays , sequels , modern updatings , or other types of adaptations . such is the case with bram stoker ’ s dracula : those who are familiar with the count dracula character of popular culture but are not well - acquainted with the original bram stoker version might be surprised to learn that two common elements of vampire lore are not to be found in stoker ’ s novel . <PARA> one element that is lacking in stoker ’ s dracula is the final dispatching of the titular count through the medium of driving a wooden stake through his heart . certainly this method of converting the undead into the really , truly dead ( usually accompanied by a simultaneous decapitation ) appears several times throughout the novel , such as when professor abraham van helsing writes to dr . john seward ( in chapter 15 ) that the latter must : <PARA> van helsing repeats the need for staking and decapitation in chapter 18 : <PARA> in chapter 25 , jonathan harker details in his journal how he plans to help turn count dracula to dust : <PARA> and also in chapter 25 , mina murray requests that this procedure be performed on her should she succumb to the world of vampirism : <PARA> this is indeed the method by which van helsing dispatches dracula ’ s “ brides ,” and in chapter 16 arthur holmwood follows similar instructions from van helsing in order to free his fiancée lucy from the torment of the undead : <PARA> in the novel ’ s climactic scene , however , it is not a wooden stake but rather two knives — a kukri and a bowie — that serve as the instruments which finally turn count dracula to dust : <PARA> another element surprisingly absent from bram stoker ’ s dracula is the notion that vampires cannot ever expose themselves to daylight ; they must return to a safe enclosure ( typically a coffin ) before dawn and remain there until after dark . this isn ’ t the case in stoker ’ s novel : even though jonathan harker muses in his journal ( in chapter 4 ) that “ i have not yet seen the count in the daylight . can it be that he sleeps when others wake , that he may be awake whilst they sleep ?” he is clearly mistaken in his assumption , as he previously had a daytime encounter with dracula : <PARA> and as author elizabeth miller noted in dracula : sense & nonsense , several more instances of the vampire dracula ’ s being out and about during daylight hours occur in the novel : <PARA> miller noted that successive film adaptations were responsible for introducing and promulgating this aspect of the dracula story :	
true	subject : stunning blow to mitt romney – salt lake tribune endorses obama <PARA> salt lake tribune endorses president obama over mitt romney , who organized city ’ s olympics . looking for the truth is this was even published or it is false <PARA> is this true ? <PARA> “ salt lake city tribune endorses obama for re - election ” <PARA> origins : despite the significant ties republican presidential candidate mitt romney has to utah ’ s salt lake city — including his prominent membership in the church of jesus christ of latter - day saints ( which is headquartered in that city ), and his work as the president and ceo of the salt lake organizing committee for the 2002 winter olympics — it came as a surprise to many people that the salt lake tribune , the highest - circulation daily newspaper in utah , endorsed his opponent , barack obama , in the 2012 presidential contest . <PARA> in a 19 october 2012 editorial entitled “ too many mitts ,” the tribune cited the former massachusetts governor ’ s shifting positions on political issues and his refusal to provide specifics about his economic plans as its primary reasons for declining to endorse him for president : <PARA> from his embrace of the party ’ s radical right wing , to subsequent portrayals of himself as a moderate champion of the middle class , romney has raised the most frequently asked question of the campaign : “ who is this guy , really , and what in the world does he truly believe ?” <PARA> the evidence suggests no clear answer , or at least one that would survive romney ’ s next speech or sound bite . politicians routinely tailor <PARA> their words to suit an audience . romney , though , is shameless , lavishing vastly diverse audiences with words , any words , they would trade their votes to hear . <PARA> more troubling , romney has repeatedly refused to share specifics of his radical plan to simultaneously reduce the debt , get rid of obamacare ( or , as he now says , only part of it ), make a voucher program of medicare , slash taxes and spending , and thereby create millions of new jobs . to claim , as romney does , that he would offset his tax and spending cuts ( except for billions more for the military ) by doing away with tax deductions and exemptions is utterly meaningless without identifying which and how many would get the ax . absent those specifics , his promise of a balanced budget simply does not pencil out . <PARA> [...] <PARA> in considering which candidate to endorse , the salt lake tribune editorial board had hoped that romney would exhibit the same talents for organization , pragmatic problem solving and inspired leadership that he displayed here more than a decade ago . instead , we have watched him morph into a friend of the far right , then tack toward the center with breathtaking aplomb . through a pair of presidential debates , romney ’ s domestic agenda remains bereft of detail and worthy of mistrust . <PARA> therefore , our endorsement must go to the incumbent , a competent leader who , against tough odds , has guided the country through catastrophe and set a course that , while rocky , is pointing toward a brighter day . the president has earned a second term . romney , in whatever guise , does not deserve a first . <PARA> the evidence suggests no clear answer , or at least one that would survive romney ’ s next speech or sound bite . politicians routinely tailor <PARA> their words to suit an audience . romney , though , is shameless , lavishing vastly diverse audiences with words , any words , they would trade their votes to hear . <PARA> more troubling , romney has repeatedly refused to share specifics of his radical plan to simultaneously reduce the debt , get rid of obamacare ( or , as he now says , only part of it ), make a voucher program of medicare , slash taxes and spending , and thereby create millions of new jobs . to claim , as romney does , that he would offset his tax and spending cuts ( except for billions more for the military ) by doing away with tax deductions and exemptions is utterly meaningless without identifying which and how many would get the ax . absent those specifics , his promise of a balanced budget simply does not pencil out . <PARA> [...] <PARA> in considering which candidate to endorse , the salt lake tribune editorial board had hoped that romney would exhibit the same talents for organization , pragmatic problem solving and inspired leadership that he displayed here more than a decade ago . instead , we have watched him morph into a friend of the far right , then tack toward the center with breathtaking aplomb . through a pair of presidential debates , romney ’ s domestic agenda remains bereft of detail and worthy of mistrust . <PARA> therefore , our endorsement must go to the incumbent , a competent leader who , against tough odds , has guided the country through catastrophe and set a course that , while rocky , is pointing toward a brighter day . the president has earned a second term . romney , in whatever guise , does not deserve a first . <PARA> the tribune noted in a follow - up piece that their editorial endorsing barack obama “ flooded the trib ’ s website and nearly logged an all - time high in unique visitors .” <PARA> those who followed the 2008 presidential campaign closely might not have found the salt lake tribune ‘ s endorsement of barack obama in 2012 too much of a surprise , as that newspaper endorsed him in the 2008 election as well .

false	examples : [ collected via e - mail , october 2012 ] <PARA> i heard that donald trump ’ s hired private investigator found out that barack and michelle obama have actually been divorced for some time now . is this true ? <PARA> origins : the may 2012 publication of edward klein ’ s biography of barack obama , the amateur , caused something of a stir with the book ’ s controversial claim ( denied by those involved ) that after obama was defeated by bobby rush in the 2000 democratic primary for illinois ’ 1st congressional district , his marriage was “ on the rocks ” to the point that , according to an unidentified “ friend ,” his wife michelle went so far as to take out divorce papers : <PARA> after obama ’ s humiliating defeat , he was broke and deeply in debt , and it looked as though he might be finished in public life . for a narcissist like obama , this was a calamitous turn of events , and during the dark days that followed his defeat , he turned to michelle for comfort . but she was in no mood to offer him sympathy . after all , he had refused to listen to her warnings about taking on the formidable bobby rush . he had put his family in a precarious financial position . and he had dashed michelle ’ s hopes of creating a stable and secure future . as a result , their marriage was on the rocks , and obama confided to friends that he and michelle were talking about divorce . <PARA> “ michelle actually had divorce papers drawn up ,” one of her friends told me . <PARA> “ michelle actually had divorce papers drawn up ,” one of her friends told me . <PARA> when business magnate donald trump announced in october 2012 that he would soon be revealing “ something very , very big concerning the president of the united states ” that could possibly change the race for the white house , speculation ran rampant about what he might be planning on disclosing . one guess was that trump has obtained copies of the putative divorce papers referenced in edward klein ’ s book : <PARA> donald trump is to claim that he has unearthed divorce papers of michelle obama and the president , according to a respected financial pundit with links to the tycoon . <PARA> it is alleged that the eccentric real estate mogul will claim that the documents show the first lady and the president were at one point in their two decades of marriage seriously considering splitting up . <PARA> trump set the hare running by claiming that he was set to make an announcement that would be ‘ bordering on gigantic ’ and that it would ‘ possibly ’ change the presidential race . <PARA> it is alleged that the eccentric real estate mogul will claim that the documents show the first lady and the president were at one point in their two decades of marriage seriously considering splitting up . <PARA> trump set the hare running by claiming that he was set to make an announcement that would be ‘ bordering on gigantic ’ and that it would ‘ possibly ’ change the presidential race . <PARA> trump ’ s “ major announcement ” turned out to be a non - revelatory one that had nothing to do with the subject of divorce : he merely pledged to pay $ 5 million to charity if president obama would release his college and passport records : <PARA> donald trump pledged $ 5 million to a charity of president obama ’ s choice , provided the president makes public his college applications and transcripts and releases his passport history , a far cry from the october - surprise bombshell trump had promised . <PARA> calling the offer a “ major announcement ,” trump released a video via twitter to much ballyhoo , and his online followers grew by the hundreds in the moments before the video was released . <PARA> “ i have a deal for the president ,” trump said . “ if barack obama opens up and gives his college records and applications , and passport application and records , i will give to a charity of his choice , a check immediately for $ 5 million .” <PARA> calling the offer a “ major announcement ,” trump released a video via twitter to much ballyhoo , and his online followers grew by the hundreds in the moments before the video was released . <PARA> “ i have a deal for the president ,” trump said . “ if barack obama opens up and gives his college records and applications , and passport application and records , i will give to a charity of his choice , a check immediately for $ 5 million .”	
mixture	in england anyone over 59 cannot receive heart repairs or stents or bypass because it is not covered as being too expensive and not needed . <PARA> i got this today and am sending it on . if obama ’ s plans in other areas don ’ t scare you , this should . <PARA> please do not let obama sign senior death warrants <PARA> everybody that is on this mailing list is either a senior citizen , is getting close or knows somebody that is . <PARA> most of you know by now that the senate version ( at least ) of the “ stimulus ” bill includes provisions for extensive rationing of health care for senior citizens . the author of this part of the bill , former senator and tax evader , tom daschle was credited today by bloomberg with the following statement : <PARA> bloomberg : daschle says “ health - care reform will not be pain free . seniors should be more accepting of the conditions that come with age instead of treating them .” <PARA> if this does not sufficiently raise your ire , just remember that senators and congressmen have their own healthcare plan that is first dollar or very low co - pay which they are guaranteed the remainder of their lives and are not subject to this new law if it passes . <PARA> please use the power of the internet to get this message out . talk it up at the grassroots level .... we have an election coming up in one year and nine months . we have the ability to address and reverse the dangerous direction the obama administration and it allies have begun and in the interim , we can make their lives miserable . lets do it ! if you disagree , don ’ t do anything . <PARA> origins : whenever the subject of health care reform is taken up in the u . s ., a common argument expressed in opposition is that increased government involvement in the health care system will inevitably result in a significant rationing of services , with senior citizens being the group most adversely affected by such rationing . the e - mail quoted above is an expression in that vein — a warning that health care reform will be tantamount to signing “ senior death warrants ” — but its supporting statements are a mixture of true , false , and questionable information . <PARA> the death of actress natasha richardson from a head injury sustained in a skiing accident on mont tremblant in quebec in march 2009 was quickly seized upon by many critics as an example of the perils of “ socialized medicine ” — it was a lack of crucial equipment such as ct scanners and medevac helicopters that killed her , they said ; if her accident had occurred in the u . s ., she probably would have survived . while the <PARA> question of whether richardson might have survived under different conditions is unanswerable , the way the issue is presented here is inaccurate . <PARA> about four hours elapsed between richardson ’ s accident and her admission to a hospital , but that delay was due to the actress ’ having initially declined to be transported elsewhere for medical treatment when paramedics first tended to her at the ski resort . only after a second emergency call was placed over two hours later and medics had worked on her for additional half hour was richardson ready to be transported to a hospital , a facility which was a 40 - minute ( not eight - hour ) drive away . two hours later , she was taken by ambulance to a second hospital in montreal . <PARA> it is possible that if richardson had been immediately delivered to the second hospital by a medevac helicopter , she might have survived her injury , but that is a matter of speculation . and while it is true that a helicopter medevac service was not available in the particular area of quebec where her accident occurred , it is not true ( as some have inferred ) that all of canada lacks access to such medevac services . <PARA> although the health care initiative proposed by president obama ( commonly dubbed “ obamacare ”) is often characterized as the adoption of a medical system identical to that used in canada and / or the uk , that characterization is not accurate . the president ’ s plan calls for providing americans with the option of government health insurance ( which will compete with private insurance plans ), not for replacing the entire u . s . medical system with a single - payer , government - funded system .

mail which is critical of provisions of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( better known as the “ stimulus bill “), that established a federal coordinating council for comparative effectiveness research ( fcccer ) to “ provide information on the relative strengths and weakness of various medical interventions ” and “ give clinicians and patients valid information to make decisions that will improve the performance of the u . s . health care system .” says that article : <PARA> medicare now pays for treatments deemed safe and effective . the stimulus bill would change that and apply a cost - effectiveness standard set by the federal council . <PARA> the federal council is modeled after a u . k . board [ the national institute for health and clinical excellence , or nice ], discussed in daschle ’ s book . this board approves or rejects treatments using a formula that divides the cost of the treatment by the number of years the patient is likely to benefit . treatments for younger patients are more often approved than treatments for diseases that affect the elderly , such as osteoporosis . <PARA> the federal council is modeled after a u . k . board [ the national institute for health and clinical excellence , or nice ], discussed in daschle ’ s book . this board approves or rejects treatments using a formula that divides the cost of the treatment by the number of years the patient is likely to benefit . treatments for younger patients are more often approved than treatments for diseases that affect the elderly , such as osteoporosis . <PARA> the wall street journal observed that : <PARA> proponents argue that such cost - benefit analysis has to figure into health - care decisions , and that any medical system rations care in some way . and it is true that u . s . private insurers also deny reimbursement for some kinds of care . the core issue is whether those decisions are going to be dictated by [...] politics ( nice ) or by prices ( a private insurance system ). <PARA> although the statement credited to tom daschle was included in a 9 february 2009 bloomberg article by betsy mccaughey , it ’ s not a direct quote from the former senator . here ’ s how the sentence actually reads as presented in that article : <PARA> daschle says health - care reform “ will not be pain free .” seniors should be more accepting of the conditions that come with age instead of treating them . that means the elderly will bear the brunt . <PARA> note the difference in quotation marks : only the words “ will not be pain free ” are actually daschle ’ s . the rest , as politifact noted , is the author ’ s interpretation of material that appeared in daschle ’ s 2008 book , critical : what we can do about the health - care crisis : <PARA> we contacted mccaughey to see which parts of this were her words and which were daschle ’ s . <PARA> the phrase that health care reform “ will not be pain - free ” is a direct quote from daschle , she explained . she said the sentence beginning “ seniors should be more accepting ” was her paraphrasing of an argument in daschle ’ s book in which he quotes david mechanic , a health care policy expert at rutgers university , saying , “ more and more of what were once seen as social , behavioral , or normative aspects of every day life , or as a normal process of aging , are now framed in a medical context . ... whether wrinkles , breasts , or buttocks , impotence or social anxieties , or inattention in school , they all have become grist for the medical mill .” <PARA> we think it ’ s a stretch to summarize daschle ’ s position as saying that seniors should be more accepting of the conditions that come with age instead of treating them . not treating wrinkles is one thing . not treating , say , heart disease , is another . <PARA> the phrase that health care reform “ will not be pain -

false	examples : <PARA> must listen this needs to go viral . a brain surgeon called into the mark levin show . if you are over 70 years of age and you go to the er and you are on government supported care , you will get comfort care instead of surgery . a government panel ( a group of people that know absolutely nothing about medicine ) will decide if you can have surgery and it has been decided that it will be denied if you are over 70 . patients will also be called “ units ” instead of “ patients ”. sarah palin was correct — death panels ! <PARA> origins : on 22 november 2011 , a caller to the mark levin show identified himself as a “ brain surgeon ” and said that he had just returned from a meeting in washington , d . c ., with the american association of neurological surgeons and the congress of neurological surgeons where “ we were reading over what the obama health care plan would be for advanced neurosurgery for patients over 70 .” according to the caller , at that meeting he viewed a document issued by the department of health and human services ( hhs ) which referred to patients over 70 years old as “ units ” and stated that if such patients were on “ government - supported care ” and needed “ advanced neurosurgical care ,” “ ethics panels ” or “ ethics committees ” established by health care reform legislation would allow them to be provided with “ comfort care ” only , not neurosurgery . <PARA> in response , the american association of neurological surgeons ( aans ) investigated the matter and determined that the caller was likely not a neurosurgeon and that the information he provided “ contained several factual inaccuracies ,” issuing the following statement about the matter : <PARA> on november 22 , 2011 , an individual claiming to be a “ brain surgeon ” made several statements referencing neurosurgical care on a mark levin radio show segment . the american association of neurological surgeons ( aans ) and the congress of neurological surgeons ( cns ) reviewed this segment and found that it contained several factual inaccuracies which we wish to clarify . <PARA> the aans and cns are unaware of any federal government document directing that advanced neurosurgery for patients over 70 years of age will not be indicated and only supportive care treatment will be provided . furthermore , in conducting our own due diligence , it appears that the caller who identified himself as a brain surgeon may not actually be a neurosurgeon , nor was there any session at the recent congress of neurological surgeons ’ scientific meeting in washington , dc at which a purported government document calling for the rationing of neurosurgical care was discussed . <PARA> neurosurgeons are committed to providing timely , compassionate , and state of the art treatment for all patients — regardless of age — who have neurosurgical conditions . as such , we have requested that this podcast be removed from mark levin ’ s website as it portrays inaccurate information which could potentially be harmful to the patients that we serve . <PARA> the aans and cns are unaware of any federal government document directing that advanced neurosurgery for patients over 70 years of age will not be indicated and only supportive care treatment will be provided . furthermore , in conducting our own due diligence , it appears that the caller who identified himself as a brain surgeon may not actually be a neurosurgeon , nor was there any session at the recent congress of neurological surgeons ’ scientific meeting in washington , dc at which a purported government document calling for the rationing of neurosurgical care was discussed . <PARA> neurosurgeons are committed to providing timely , compassionate , and state of the art treatment for all patients — regardless of age — who have neurosurgical conditions . as such , we have requested that this podcast be removed from mark levin ’ s website as it portrays inaccurate information which could potentially be harmful to the patients that we serve . <PARA> amplifying that statement , alison dye of the aans confirmed for us that they had determined the caller was not in fact a neurosurgeon , as he claimed . and erin shields of hhs told us that “ these false claims were simply made up by an anonymous call to a radio station . no such document exists and no such presentation took place .”	
unproven	origins : the quote attributed to caroline kennedy ( daughter of president john f . kennedy ) referenced above originated with edward klein ’ s 2012 book the amateur : barack obama in the white house . it appeared in the following passage , which talked about caroline kennedy — who had been a strong supporter of barack obama during the 2008 presidential campaign — becoming disenchanted with the obamas for making “ catty ” remarks about her family and for not being more liberal in political policy - making : <PARA> “ through these [ spies that the kennedy family has in the obama administration ] and other people , caroline heard back that there was a lot of nasty shit being said about the kennedys by the president and michelle ,” [ a ] family member [ said ]. “ there were catty remarks about how badly the kennedy women dressed , and how their houses were shabby and threadbare . caroline got the impression that most of this negativity was coming from michelle , who didn ’ t want the kennedys to be part of the administration for fear that they would have too much influence over the president .” <PARA> “ gradually , caroline began to change her tune and side with bobby and kathleen [ kennedy townsend ] against the obamas . unlike jackie , who was completely apolitical , caroline is a liberal with a capital l . when obama didn ’ t raise taxes to balance the budget , caroline marked him down . in her eyes , he ’ s a mess because he doesn ’ t follow the liberal bible on politics . more important , caroline discovered that the obamas didn ’ t give a damn about her support . for instance , she was not invited to the state dinners at the white house hosted by the obamas , or to the president ’ s forty - ninth birth celebration in chicago . <PARA> “ it really annoyed caroline when comparisons were made by the media between michelle [ obama ] and jackie [ kennedy ]. caroline had a word for such comparisons ; she called them ‘ odious .’ she really got annoyed . and when she began to fall out of love with the obamas , love was replaced by outright scorn . now she says things about obama like , ‘ i can ’ t stand to hear his voice any more . he ’ s a liar and worse .'” <PARA> “ gradually , caroline began to change her tune and side with bobby and kathleen [ kennedy townsend ] against the obamas . unlike jackie , who was completely apolitical , caroline is a liberal with a capital l . when obama didn ’ t raise taxes to balance the budget , caroline marked him down . in her eyes , he ’ s a mess because he doesn ’ t follow the liberal bible on politics . more important , caroline discovered that the obamas didn ’ t give a damn about her support . for instance , she was not invited to the state dinners at the white house hosted by the obamas , or to the president ’ s forty - ninth birth celebration in chicago . <PARA> “ it really annoyed caroline when comparisons were made by the media between michelle [ obama ] and jackie [ kennedy ]. caroline had a word for such comparisons ; she called them ‘ odious .’ she really got annoyed . and when she began to fall out of love with the obamas , love was replaced by outright scorn . now she says things about obama like , ‘ i can ’ t stand to hear his voice any more . he ’ s a liar and worse .'” <PARA> however verifying exactly what caroline kennedy might have said is difficult because the quote offered in this passage is second - hand rather than direct ( i . e ., it ’ s someone else talking about what she said , not a direct statement from caroline kennedy herself ) and because the source of the statement is anonymous ( beyond the description of his or her being a “ member of the kennedy clan ”). caroline kennedy herself has neither confirmed nor denied that she made the remarks attributed to her , but even after their publication she has continued to publicly express support for the obamas , such as issuing a message to wish president obama a happy father ’ s day , campaigning in new hampshire for the president ’ s re - election , and making plans to attend the democratic national convention .	
true	i need not spend much time on the failure of obama as president . his tenure has been a failure on every measurable level . so much so , in fact , that some of the staunchest , most respected liberal democrats and democratic supporters have not only openly criticized him — some even more harshly than this essayist — but they have called for him to step down . <PARA> richard nixon ’ s words “ i am not a crook ,” punctuated with his involvement in watergate , and bill clinton ’ s finger - wagging as he told one of the most pathetic lies in presidential history , in the aftermath of obama , will be viewed as mere prevarications . <PARA> [ rest of article here .] <PARA> origins : mychal s . massie is , according to the biography on his web site ( the daily rant : black conservative mychal massie ’ s hard hitting commentary on race , obama and politics ): <PARA> mychal s . massie is the former national chairman of the conservative black think tank , project 21 - the national leadership network of black conservatives ; and a member of its ’ [ sic ] parent think tank , the national center for public policy research . in his official capacity with this free market public policy think tank he has spoken at the u . s . capitol , cpac , participated in numerous press conferences on capitol hill , the national press club and has testified concerning property rights pursuant to the “ endangered species act ” before the chairman of the house committee on resources . he has been a keynote speaker at colleges and universities nationwide , at tea party rallies , at rallies supporting our troops and conservative presidents ; and rally ’ s [ sic ] supporting conservative causes across the country . he is an unapologetic supporter of our right to own and carry firearms . <PARA> the opinion piece referenced above , “ nero in the white house ,” was his column of 8 august 2011 .

false	“ if the people let the government decide what foods they eat and what medicines they take , their bodies will soon be in a sorry a state as are the souls of those who live under tyranny .” – thomas jefferson <PARA> origins : notes on the state of virginia was the only full - length book by thomas jefferson which was published during his lifetime . initially finished in 1781 ( with additional updates in 1782 and 1783 ), the book was presented in a format which had jefferson responding to questions about virginia which had been posed to him in 1780 by françois barbé - marbois , the secretary of the french delegation at philadelphia . the completed work was first published anonymously in paris in 1785 ; the first english edition appeared in london in 1787 . <PARA> in response to a question about the various religious groups that had made their way into virginia , jefferson wrote : <PARA> since the late 1990s , the sentence highlighted above has been transformed into the statement “ if the people let the government decide what foods they eat and what medicines they take , their bodies will soon be in a sorry a state as are the souls of those who live under tyranny ” and proffered as a founding father ’ s sagacious warning across the centuries about the dangers of government - run health care . but that isn ’ t what jefferson wrote , nor is it what he meant . jefferson wasn ’ t cautioning against the government ’ s meddling with private medical practice and likening it to tyranny ; he was suggesting that legislating morality was as futile as legislating what a person might swallow . his larger point was that we are the keepers of our own souls ( in the sense of being free to practice whichever religion we choose ), and the that state has no more right to govern our souls than it has to govern our bodies ( by , for example , choosing our medicines and diets for us ).

false	the worker then said to obama that this is the flag of the state of wisconsin — which was founded in 1848 . <PARA> this was only reported by a local radio station in milwaukee and not by the major news networks — they did not want to embarrass this “ got no clue ” president . <PARA> since they didn ’ t do their job of reporting on this presidential visit . the only way for the news to get around is by us — on the internet . <PARA> origins : on 15 february 2012 , president barack obama traveled to milwaukee , wisconsin , where he visited a master lock plant that he had praised in his state of the union address for bringing jobs back from china to america and gave a speech highlighting his administration ’ s initiatives to support insourcing and american manufacturing : <PARA> president obama , who had praised master lock for bringing 100 manufacturing jobs home from china and putting its milwaukee plant at capacity and on a path to expanding , emphasized feb . 15 that this was not just a passing comment in his state of the union address . <PARA> he flew into milwaukee accompanied by popular milwaukee rep . gwen moore as the first leg of a ferocious national policy push for more american manufacturing jobs , tax code changes , local initiatives , tax breaks for manufacturers that create american jobs , the end of tax breaks for companies that outsource such work and massive skills training for available jobs for two million americans through expanded funding for community colleges . <PARA> obama had no problem [ with his speech ] in front of a boisterous crowd of about 800 stacked with elected officials , residents of one of american ’ s hardest hit communities and the hundreds of cheering workers from uaw local 469 , the core of master lock . <PARA> he flew into milwaukee accompanied by popular milwaukee rep . gwen moore as the first leg of a ferocious national policy push for more american manufacturing jobs , tax code changes , local initiatives , tax breaks for manufacturers that create american jobs , the end of tax breaks for companies that outsource such work and massive skills training for available jobs for two million americans through expanded funding for community colleges . <PARA> obama had no problem [ with his speech ] in front of a boisterous crowd of about 800 stacked with elected officials , residents of one of american ’ s hardest hit communities and the hundreds of cheering workers from uaw local 469 , the core of master lock . <PARA> shortly after president obama ’ s milwaukee visit the online rumor reproduced above began circulating , claiming that while touring the master lock plant , the president mistook the state flag of wisconsin for a union banner — a gaffe that supposedly went completely unreported by the news media save for one local radio station . in fact , a confusion of the wisconsin state flag with a union banner did occur in conjunction with that presidential visit , and it did draw some modest coverage , but president obama was not involved in the incident . the error occurred in a politico article ( since removed from that site ) about the president ’ s visit to milwaukee , in which reporter donovan slack misidentified the wisconsin state flag as “ a flag for the local union , wisconsin 1848 ”: <PARA> wh flies labor flag in milwaukee <PARA> milwaukee — it ’ s very clear what side president obama is on here in wisconsin . <PARA> behind the stage where he will speak today are two flags : an american one , as usual , and right alongside it — and a flag for the local union , wisconsin 1848 . <PARA> the president has been mum in recent months on the battle raging in the badger state between unions and republican gov . scott walker , who is facing a recall election largely pushed by labor after he pushed through laws effectively taking away collective bargaining rights in the state . <PARA> here at master lock , obama is speaking about domestic manufacturing and highlighting what he calls “ in - sourcing ,” bringing jobs back from overseas . the padlock manufacturer brought roughly 100 jobs back from china to this factory — union jobs , the white house has noted . <PARA> walker had been expected to join the president but canceled this morning because his office said he has the flu . <PARA> given that the central design element of the wisconsin state flag represents the state ’ s main industries ( manufacturing , agriculture , mining , and shipping ) by featuring a sailor with rope and a miner with a pickaxe surrounding a yellow shield depicting an arm and hammer , a plow , a pick and shovel , and an anchor , the wisconsin flag is something that an unfamiliar observer might easily confuse for a labor union banner . <PARA> this item is reminiscent of a similar occurrence that took place in october 2008 , when presidential candidate barack obama gave a speech in toledo , ohio , in front of a backdrop of u . s . and ohio state flags , and some viewers unfamiliar with the latter mistook them for obama campaign flags .	
unproven	“ hi darling , it ’ s peter , i ’ m on the train – yes , i know it ’ s the 6 . 30 not the 4 . 30 but i had a long meeting – no , not with that floozy from the typing pool , with the boss ..... no darling , you ’ re the only one in my life – yes , i ’ m sure , cross my heart .” etc ., etc . <PARA> this was still going on at wimbledon , when the young woman opposite him , driven beyond endurance , yelled at the top of her voice – <PARA> “ hey , peter , turn that bloody phone off and come back to bed !!” <PARA> variations : <PARA> origins : modern life subjects us to the cell phone calls of others while we ’ re trapped in public locales from which there is no immediate escape ( elevators , subway trains , and the like ), thereby forcing us into becoming a hostage audience to the drama of others . while , mercifully , most calls placed or received in tightly - confined public settings are of short duration , sometimes the one on the mobile either doesn ’ t realize he ’ s being annoying or doesn ’ t care that he is disturbing others . at those moments , thoughts of retribution naturally occur among those being imposed upon , which brings us to our tale about an overheard cell phone call on a train in britain and one woman ’ s way of handling its self - important miscreant . <PARA> as satisfying a yarn as this is , it ’ s likely better regarded as a story about an imagined revenge rather than an account of an actual incident . it offers no checkable datapoints that can independently be verified , not so much as date , location , or full names of those involved . the few details that flesh out the anecdote ( which cities the train was traveling between , the first name of the man making the call , where along the route the fed up female passenger inserted herself into the conversation ) change from telling to telling , as evidenced by the variations section listed above . <PARA> moreover , certain turns of phrase within it give one pause . while floozy has been recorded as part of the english language since 1911 , it ’ s rarely encountered these days , other slang for “ woman of disreputable character ” having mostly displaced it . then there ’ s the matter of <PARA> typing pool , a term not seen much of since the 1960s and earlier when it was common for certain larger companies to keep on hand a group of stenographers or typists unassigned to particular bosses who could be handed correspondence to be typed by executives that lacked their own personal secretaries . both terms appear to be part of the tale only to advance the reader ’ s intuitive understanding that the man ’ s explanation for his tardiness is a bald - faced lie , that in actual fact he had been dallying with another woman that afternoon rather than meeting with his boss . <PARA> key to grasping that the story is more anecdote than truth is noting the “ hi darling , it ’ s peter ” lead - in to the call — very few among us identify ourselves by name to our spouses . yet for the story to work , the man must state his name if the woman in the background who shouts “ turn that bloody phone off and come back to bed !” is to be unmistakably understood by the wife as addressing her husband . <PARA> although this item was presented as a true story in the sydney morning herald in late - march 2012 , our earliest sighting of the tale was a 14 february 2012 appearance of it on a british web site . since that date , the yarn has resurfaced on a number of sites , sometimes identified as a humor piece and sometimes not . <PARA> a day after running the bit , the sydney morning herald sheepishly admitted to having been given “ a right royal bucketing ” from its readers for presenting as a news item what it subsequently discovered was an internet - spread anecdote of dubious origin . <PARA> as a society we remain uncertain as to what is appropriate when it comes to cell phones ( e . g ., should they be used in public lavatories ), but as with anything else , one always knows when a line has been crossed even when it ’ s impossible to define its precise location . overly loud , boorish conversations inflicted upon others are social transgressions , especially in locales from which there is no easy escape . the fictional gal in this particular legend answered rudeness with rudeness by inserting herself into the exchange between a man and his wife , thereby dealing the lout a sharp , quick lesson about the downside to forcing his private conversations upon strangers ; but we are all supposed to take from this tale the realization that there is sometimes a price to be paid for being ill - mannered and thoughtless of others , thus we ’ d better not make that mistake ourselves . <PARA> telephones and self - important conversations carried out on them feature in another urban legend , one in which an uninstalled or non - functioning telephone delivers its user to the embarrassment he so richly deserves . <PARA> barbara “ cell blocked ” mikkelson

( currently only non - service - related medical treatments are so billed .) the proposal would not have , as was often misreported , forced veterans to pay for the treatment of their injuries out of their own pockets or required them to buy private insurance ; but it did raise the prospect that injured or ill veterans might find it harder or more expensive to purchase health coverage , or to obtain employment in the private sector if employer - funded private insurance plans had to cover the additional costs of treating injuries and other service - related health problems . <PARA> the plan was heavily criticized by veterans almost from the moment it was presented to them , as the washington post reported in an account of a meeting between president obama and veterans ’ groups : <PARA> within 48 hours , the white house announced that the proposal had been dropped , but the president still came in for his fair share of criticism from those who maintained that he failed to anticipate how his proposal would be received and should have known better than to even raise the subject : <PARA> a newsday editorial summed up many americans ’ feelings about the matter in opining that :

true	origins : the one thing this tempest in a teapot makes abundantly clear is you can ’ t make everybody happy all of the time . in an ironic twist , an abc policy meant to ensure the name of jesus is not used in a profane manner has left many christians <PARA> irate . <PARA> on a 23 may 2002 episode of the view , co - host joy behar said of the end of her daily weigh - ins ( she ’ d been dieting ), “ yes , and thank you , thank you , jesus , is all i have to say .” her words were aired live in much of the country , but when abc broadcast a taped version of the show on the west coast , “ jesus ” was edited out . <PARA> according to abc spokeswoman julie hoover , that usage ran afoul of a particular standard the network adheres to . abc has no problem with jesus ’ name if it is used in a “ prayerful and respectful manner ,” she said . but abc does not allow jesus ’ name to be used in an exclamation . <PARA> in an attempt to bend over backwards to not condone what many would have seen as blasphemy , <PARA> “ jesus ” got bleeped . this put yet another group of christians up in arms over what they perceived as censorship of the holy name . rather than realizing abc had been trying to prevent what many would have seen as a misuse of the name , those ranting about censorship fretted that the network was turning its back upon jesus . <PARA> like i said , some days you can ’ t win for trying . <PARA> certain exclamations of “ jesus !” are clearly less than respectful . ( certainly all those of the “ i just hammered my thumb ” variety fall into this category .) but what about heartfelt “ thank you , jesus !” praiseful cries over the cessation of daily weigh - ins ? some will view those as wholly appropriate , some will accept them as permissible if a bit overboard , and some will out - and - out reject them as frivolous trivializations of something far too venerated and holy to be demeaned by being twinned with a successful jenny craiging . different christians will draw the “ thou shalt not take the lord thy god ’ s name in vain ” line in a different place . <PARA> we think abc was a bit overzealous in snipping the word in this instance , because a “ thank you , jesus !” exclamation over any manner of non - earth - shaking matters has become a widespread linguistic flourish and does not necessarily signify an instance of blasphemy . on the other hand , had abc not elided the word , the network would likely have come under fire from a different — if not equally fervent — group of christians who would have vehemently disagreed with what they would have seen as a slighting usage . <PARA> one thing is clear : abc did not excise the word because they were trying to “ get rid ” of jesus . rather , they were trying to protect the holy name , which is quite a different kettle fish from the one falwell is trying to stir . <PARA> barbara “ bouillibiasse bawl ” mikkelson <PARA> additional information :

in the second case , boycotting a gasoline brand over political issues is problematic for a number of reasons ( not least of which is the notion that threatening not to buy gasoline from someone who is threatening not to sell it to you doesn ’ t sound like an effective ploy for either side ). <PARA> many different oil companies buy crude oil from venezuela , so even americans who shun citgo brand gasoline have no guarantee that they aren ’ t still sending their money to that country . and although citgo may be owned by petróleos de venezuela , it is a formerly american company which is still headquartered in the u . s . ( in houston , texas ), employs 4 , 000 people , and supplies 14 , 000 independent retailers with gasoline and other petroleum products — americans with no substantive connection to venezuela who would be economically harmed by such an action . ( citgo also provides free or discounted heating oil to low - income communities and tribal reservations within the united states .) and , of course , in a tight oil market citgo could likely find alternative buyers for its products far more easily than the u . s . could make up the shortfall created by a cut - off of venezuelan oil . <PARA> as we ’ ve noted in many other articles discussing various schemes regarding where and how people should purchase gasoline , the global and fungible nature of the world oil market doesn ’ t really provide consumers with many effective opportunities to influence political issues through their buying patterns . <PARA> since the original e - petitions cited above originally appeared in early 2006 , they have gone through a number of changes that added and dropped additional claims about citgo . in september 2006 , the following addendum to one of the citgo - related e - mails began circulating : <PARA> friends , i asked you earlier to boycott citgo gas stations in response to the actions of hugo chavez and the venezuelan government . i am coming to you again and asking you to take this a step further . <PARA> many 7 - 11 stores sell citgo gas . i ask you to boy cut these stores and notify the southland corp . & the store managers of your action and be sure they know that it is because they sell citgo gas products . <PARA> you may think this is an extreme step but hugo & other american haters count on americans not to have the stomach to do anything . <PARA> prove them wrong ! <PARA> one by one we can make a difference . please forward this to others if you believe in taking a stand against the thugs of our century . <PARA> god bless america ! <PARA> many 7 -

eleven inc . announced it was dropping citgo petroleum as its gasoline supplier , although the convenience store chain also stated the move was not motivated by political issues : 7 - eleven ’ s contract with citgo was due to expire at the end of september 2006 , and the company had already made plans to market its own brand of gasoline . <PARA> in october 2006 , the following e - mail about citgo and petro express began circulating : <PARA> citgo , being aware that gasoline sales are down due to u . s . customers not wanting to buy from “ chavez ”.... have begun changing the name of some of their circle k stores in texas & oklahoma ... and possibly other places as well , to : “ petro express ” <PARA> therefore , do not buy from “ petro express ”, ... nor citgo .... <PARA> “ petro express ” is also 100 % owned by “ chavez ” .... <PARA> therefore , do not buy from “ petro express ”, ... nor citgo .... <PARA> “ petro express ” is also 100 % owned by “ chavez ” .... <PARA> both circle k and petro express <PARA> are privately - owned chains of convenience stores , the former an international property of quebec - based alimentation couche - tard , and the latter owned by the pantry , inc ., which is headquartered in sanford , north carolina . neither chain is owned by citgo or the venezuela government . <PARA> petro express outlets ( which the parent company has been converting to their kangaroo express brand ) were known for selling citgo - branded gasoline . the pantry stated in october 2006 that the chain would be phasing out sales of that brand by 2007 , and soon after the pantry ’ s acquisition of petro express in 2007 , the new parent company announced that gasoline sales at those outlets would be converted to chevron ’ s texaco brand . however , the pantry ’ s 2010 annual report indicates that citgo is still one of their fuel suppliers , with a contract running through august 2013 : <PARA> as of september 30 , 2010 , marathon , bp ® and citgo ® supplied approximately 68 % of our fuel purchases . on july <PARA> 26 , 2010 , we entered into a new fuel supply agreement with marathon . our contract with marathon for unbranded fuel and <PARA> distillate expires on december 31 , 2017 , and our contract with marathon for branded fuel and distillate expires on june 30 , <PARA> 2013 , with an option for the company to renew until december 31 , 2017 . as a result of this new fuel agreement with <PARA> marathon , we now have three principal suppliers for the majority of our fuel . on september 1 , 2010 we entered into a <PARA> marketer franchise agreement , including an addendum to marketer franchise agreement , with citgo ®. our contract with <PARA> citgo ® expires august 31 , 2013 and our contract with bp ® expires september 30 , 2012 . <PARA> it is not uncommon for independent stations and chains to switch fuel suppliers from time to time . occurrences of independents ’ dropping citgo in favor of other suppliers are often misinterpreted by the public as attempts on citgo ’ s part to “ switch names ” in order to fool consumers into continuing to purchase citgo gasoline . <PARA> an addendum about ak - 47 factories and iranian - run oil refineries was also later appended to this piece : <PARA> news flash : <PARA> chavez is now getting a russian weapons factory built by putin . <PARA> the russians are building an ak - 47 kalashnikov assault rifle factory in venezuela to give armament support to communist rebel groups throughout the americas . <PARA> chavez now has iranians operating his oil refineries in venezuela for him . it is likely only a matter of time , if not already , before chavez has iranian built long range missiles , with a variety of warhead types aimed at : guess who ? <PARA> chavez is now getting a russian weapons factory built by putin . <PARA> the russians are building an ak -

false	origins : in the speculation - drenched weeks that followed the september 11 terrorist attacks , the one expected rumor that <PARA> failed to surface was of the “ osama bin laden spotted at a starbucks in new jersey ” ilk . sightings of the dread enemy walking among the populace he menaces are a common form of wartime scuttlebutt and serve as an expression of the reality of the danger he represents . a rumor of that nature works to keep the minds of those on the homefront focused on whom they are fighting and how great an evil he embodies ; they make the threat he represents seem more real to those who might otherwise feel somewhat distanced from the conflict underway in another theater . <PARA> yet osama was in afghanistan , as events soon revealed . moreover , the us was locked down — anyone of even vaguely middle eastern appearance was going to be heavily scrutinized before being allowed entry into the land of the free . could the rumor survive in the face of those odds ? <PARA> it did indeed . rumors about bin laden ’ s living in the salt lake city area have been rife . those who look for something plausible to hang their gossip hats on point to that area ’ s desert - like conditions and purported tolerance towards plural marriages as reasons why the contractor would choose to set up housekeeping there . ( yeah , right . he kills thousands of innocents and is the target of the most intense manhunt in history , but he doesn ’ t want to risk getting in trouble for having too many wives .) <PARA> according to the salt lake tribune , “ federal agents in salt lake city say they have recently fielded dozens of reports that the accused terrorist mastermind has been spotted on the freeway , in the mall or enjoying a big mac and fries at mcdonald ’ s .” fbi special agent kevin eaton is quoted in that same article confirming the number of such reports his office has had to field . “ it is pretty surprising how many people really believe he is here ,” eaton said . <PARA> lt . charles illsley of the west valley city police department likens the recent wave of bin laden sightings to the ted bundy sightings that followed his 1977 escape from a colorado jail and offers the following keen insight into the phenomenon : “ when day - after - day media reports focus on a single person like bundy or bin laden , it is not too big a leap for somebody to go outside and think they see him . images stick .” <PARA> during world war ii , although the nazis did not make it to america , rumors about enemy agents sauntering the streets of various towns in the usa did . hitler wasn ’ t spotted here , but his minions were — they were seen furtively signaling u - boats and laying out markers to guide bombers to their targets . they turned up in truck stops and restaurants looking as unremarkable as anyone else until some small sign inadvertently revealed them for who they <PARA> were . <PARA> then ( as now ) the fbi was bedeviled by a constant barrage of false reports , each of which had to be investigated . according to the rumors afoot then , saboteurs lurked behind every post , and often we initially assumed strangers were enemy agents and only grudgingly afterwards acknowledged them to be mere folks who had just arrived from another town . simple actions that in peacetime would have drawn no comment suddenly appeared ominous — a man spotted notebook in hand near a viaduct over railroad tracks immediately became the subject of a rumor that he was checking troop movements and shipments of war supplies . upon investigation , that man turned out to one of the city ’ s smoke inspectors . the actions of a couple staying in a seaside hotel ( they lowered the shades for privacy and opened the window to catch the breeze ) sparked a rumor that enemy operatives were signaling to submarines lying offshore . and so it went . <PARA> the threat of enemy action on american soil is far greater these days than it was even at the height of the second great war . rumors about honey - skinned terrorists abound , but it needs be stressed that even though there ’ s more to fear now , those rumors are just echoes of similar ones heard over half a century ago . though the reality may be different , the perception of danger is not , and that is what people react to and express through the rumors they exchange . <PARA> the citizenry of the 1940s knew the visage of evil as that of hitler ’ s , whereas their counterparts of the 2000s recognize it as bin laden ’ s . it is thus no wonder they search for his face in the crowd . <PARA> barbara “ faces of death ” mikkelson <PARA> sightings : canada ’ s popular weekly satire tv show the royal canadian air farce has run “ bin laden watch ” segments sporadically since the terrorist attacks . photos of osama are inserted into donut shops , dollar stores , and the like , or he is shown chairing a meeting of the board of directors of nortel .

city fraud and theft ring operating at wal - mart involving wal - mart employees . it was alleged in the letter that the employees of the store would obtain a customer ’ s checking account information , and the information would be used to create fraudulent checks . <PARA> this letter was not official or sanctioned in any way by the department of public safety ; unfortunately this letter was made public . the department will be conducting an internal investigation and , at the conclusion of the investigation , will take the appropriate corrective and / or disciplinary action . <PARA> members of the public should not rely on information contained in the letter . as always , consumers are cautioned to take steps to limit disclosure of their personal information and to be aware of their surroundings . <PARA> this letter was not official or sanctioned in any way by the department of public safety ; unfortunately this letter was made public . the department will be conducting an internal investigation and , at the conclusion of the investigation , will take the appropriate corrective and / or disciplinary action . <PARA> members of the public should not rely on information contained in the letter . as always , consumers are cautioned to take steps to limit disclosure of their personal information and to be aware of their surroundings . <PARA> as for the content of the memo , we note that instances of check fraud have been tied to a then - new practice ( used in some walmart stores ) of processing checks not by the “ traditional ” method of retaining them and submitting them to banks for deposit , but by using them as authorizations to initiate electronic funds transfers ( efts ) and immediately returning them to customers . in some cases , dishonest sales clerks have abused this procedure by deliberately failing to return checks to customers , then re - scanning the checks multiple times and using the ill - gotten proceeds to purchase gift cards and other merchandise . <PARA> for example , tv station ktrk in houston reported the following check - theft scam by a walmart employee in december 2006 : <PARA> a former wal - mart employee is behind bars for her role in what authorities are calling a check fraud scheme . <PARA> when you write a check at wal - mart , you hand it to a clerk who then runs the check through an electronic scanner and hands it back to you . unfortunately some wal - mart shoppers did not get their checks handed back to them and it cost them thousands of dollars . <PARA> pam davis never thought writing a $ 37 check at wal - mart would cost her thousands of dollars , but that ’ s exactly what happened . <PARA> she said , “ i had gone to wal mart and written a check for $ 37 and did not realize i did not get that check back , which is the custom with electronic transfer . you are supposed to <PARA> receive the check back .” <PARA> davis says — and authorities confirm — a clerk at wal - mart never returned davis ’ check at the time of purchase , [ so ] the clerk was able to re - run the check through the electronic reader again and again . <PARA> five times , they changed the amounts each time ,” davis claimed . “ it was almost $ 3 , 000 .” <PARA> authorities believe the clerk gave the checks to other people who then went on shopping sprees inside the store . <PARA> capt . mark herman with precinct 4 said , “ in some of the cases they were getting $ 300 wal - mart gift cards , clothing , just all kinds of purchases .” <PARA> constables say the clerk did the same thing with checks written by other wal - mart customers . <PARA> when you write a check at wal -

mart customers was sentenced to prison . <PARA> robert macvittie and his wife lined up behind customers trying to cash payroll checks at “ dozens and dozens ” of wal - mart stores in 20 states and recorded them providing their social security numbers , assistant u . s . attorney gregory melucci said at the hearing where macvittie received a 34 - month sentence . the couple would then use the victims ’ identities to create counterfeit checks , which they cashed at other wal - marts . <PARA> melucci called macvittie , 35 , and his wife jennifer , 32 , “ the bonnie and clyde of counterfeit checks .” <PARA> more than 400 people had their identities used on the successfully cashed counterfeit checks , melucci said . <PARA> robert macvittie and his wife lined up behind customers trying to cash payroll checks at “ dozens and dozens ” of wal -

mixture	just as a quick warning to you — i just got assaulted at an hsbc cashpoint in hanover sq at lunchtime ( broad daylight , with a queue behind me ) and £ 200 was taken from my account . turns out there ’ s a gang of very smart romanians ( in my case it was 2 guys and a girl ) who are posing as free - newspaper - giver - outers – they waited until i ’ d keyed in my pin and hit the ‘ get cash ’ option before coming up from both sides , jostling me and thrusting their newspapers at me and trying to persuade me to take one . <PARA> behind the papers , the guy on my left hit the £ 200 button and the girl on the right grabbed the cash — they were so fast that no one in the queue even saw them take it , and just assumed they were harrassing me to take a paper ( my card got returned to me out of the machine ). it was only when i went into the bank to tell them there were people harrassing cashpoint users and to double check they hadn ’ t taken any cash that we realised . went to the police and it turns out they ’ ve been targeting women around mayfair and goodge st and elsewhere around oxford circus with a huge number of incidents in the past couple of weeks — all in broad daylight and in very open places , and always taking £ 200 . the advice is to use cash machines inside banks or get cashback if you ’ re in these areas . <PARA> origins : this e - mail began landing in the snopes . com inbox in mid - april 2007 . while we ’ ve yet to locate news articles about such robberies taking place in england , lack of published <PARA> confirmation doesn ’ t necessarily rule them out , as information about every mugging doesn ’ t always make it into the day ’ s papers . still , one would think a “ huge number of incidents in the past couple of weeks ” would have merited mention by the press who cover the crime beat . <PARA> numerous readers from the uk have written to explain how their atms operate , and their descriptions rule out the crime being carried out in the fashion set forth in the e - mail . uk atms will return users ’ cards before dispensing the cash asked for , a bit of programming worked into those contraptions to prevent the absent - minded from taking their money but leaving their plastic in the machines . <PARA> as one of our readers explains : <PARA> so , for the crime to take place in the few seconds that the victim is distracted , the thieves would have to 1 ) hit the £ 200 button , 2 ) wait the few seconds it takes for the transaction to take place , 3 ) remove the victim ’ s card ( and usually the return of the card is accompanied by loud warning bleeps from the machine ), 4 ) wait another few seconds for the cash to be dispensed ( also accompanied by warning bleeps ), and 5 ) reinsert the card in the machine ’ s slot . even if the victim ’ s vision of the machine is blocked by the distracting paper vendor , they ’ re going to hear something odd going on with their transaction , and the whole process can ’ t be done in less than 20 seconds or so . <PARA> however , it does appear that the very form of theft described in the e - mail has been used successfully in ireland . in may 2007 , a 15 - year - old romanian boy pled guilty to employing this type of robbery with the help of an accomplice at an ulster bank atm in dublin plus at two other atms ( banks unnamed ) in the same city . in each case , the team made of with € 200 . <PARA> still , though this particular crime can ’ t be carried out at every atm does not mean one is always entirely safe when using cashpoints . pickpockets and muggers have been known to prey upon those who use atms , however . ( which makes perfect sense when you think about it : if you were a pickpocket or mugger , wouldn ’ t you be inspired to hang about relatively unsupervised outdoor locations where potential victims go to load themselves up with cash ?) it therefore pays to stay alert to one ’ s surroundings when using these <PARA> machines . <PARA> there are precautions folks can take to lessen their chances of being victimized when using atm or cashpoint machines . while some work to protect users from having their financial information stolen and others to lessen the chances of being mugged at the machines , they all bear taking to heart :	
unproven	examples : <PARA> a new york businessman goes out for a mid - morning jog in central park , clad in a trendy warm - up suit . along the way he is bumped by another runner , and not long afterward he realizes that his wallet is missing from his pocket . <PARA> outraged , the businessman catches up to the other runner and , in his best james cagney snarl , demands : “ give me that wallet !” the startled runner hands the man a wallet . <PARA> later , as he changes into his business suit back at the office , the man discovers that he had left his own wallet on the desk when he went out to run . <PARA> [ parade magazine , 1972 , as told by comic gus christie ] <PARA> this is supposed to be a true story . a man , we ’ ll call him mr . jones , is riding to work on the subway in new york city and there ’ s this guy who keeps bumping into him . after awhile jones gets apprehensive and thinks , “ this can ’ t be what i think it is !” he checks his wallet — and it ’ s gone . “ that ’ s it ! nine o ’ clock in the morning and i get mugged in the subway . things are really getting bad .” he grabs the guy , shakes him hard , and says , “ all right , cough up , give me that wallet !” the guy is petrified and he hands over a wallet . so jones goes off to work and when he gets to his office his wife calls and says , “ honey , you left your wallet on the bureau this morning .” <PARA> origins : how old is old ? according to brunvand , an earlier version of the legend originated in russia and can be found in six red months in russia , a collection of articles originally published in the philadelphia public ledger in 1918 . urban legends keep pace with changing conditions , with joggers in expensive warm - up suits replacing turn - of - the - century victims . <PARA> the “ jogger ’ s billfold ” legend is told in another form , one involving a sum of paper money and a woman who suspects another of having swiped it out of her purse . in britain , this tale is sometimes referred to as “ the five pound note .” though the following example comes from 1912 , keep in mind the same story makes the rounds today in almost exactly the same form : <PARA> [ collected by briggs , 1912 ] <PARA> an elderly brother and sister lived together , and one day the sister wanted to go to town to do some shopping . so her brother gave her a five - pound note , and she set out . she traveled third class , and the only other passenger was a shabby old woman who sat opposite her and nodded . miss m was sleepy too , after her early start , so she dozed a little too . then she woke up , and thought it wasn ’ t very safe to go to sleep in a railway carriage , alone with a stranger . she opened her bag to make some notes of what she had to buy , and the five - pound note wasn ’ t there . she looked at her neighbor , who was sleeping heavily with a big old shabby bag beside her . miss m bent forward and , very cautiously , she opened the bag . there was a new five - pound note on top of everything . <PARA> “ old scoundrel !” thought miss m . then she thought , “ she ’ s poor and old , and i oughtn ’ t to have put temptation in her way .” she wondered what she ought to do . it would cause a great deal of delay and bother to call the police , and it seemed cruel to get an old woman into trouble , but she must have her money . so , in the end , she quietly took the five pounds out of the bag and shut it up again . <PARA> at the next stop , the old woman got out , and miss m got to town and did her day ’ s shopping , and came home loaded with parcels . her brother met her at the station . “ how did you manage ? he said . “ i expected to find you up a gum tree . you left your five - pound note on the dressing table .” <PARA> an elderly brother and sister lived together , and one day the sister wanted to go to town to do some shopping . so her brother gave her a five - pound note , and she set out . she traveled third class , and the only other passenger was a shabby old woman who sat opposite her and nodded . miss m was sleepy too , after her early start , so she dozed a little too . then she woke up , and thought it wasn ’ t very safe to go to sleep in a railway carriage , alone with a stranger . she opened her bag to make some notes of what she had to buy , and the five - pound note wasn ’ t there . she looked at her neighbor , who was sleeping heavily with a big old shabby bag beside her . miss m bent forward and , very cautiously , she opened the bag . there was a new five - pound note on top of everything . <PARA> “ old scoundrel !” thought miss m . then she thought , “ she ’ s poor and old , and i oughtn ’ t to have put temptation in her way .” she wondered what she ought to do . it would cause a great deal of delay and bother to call the police , and it seemed cruel to get an old woman into trouble , but she must have her money . so , in the end , she quietly took the five pounds out of the bag and shut it up again . <PARA> at the next stop , the old woman got out , and miss m got to town and did her day ’ s shopping , and came home loaded with parcels . her brother met her at the station . “ how did you manage ?

( visit our pocket ( ed ) watch , stolen biscuits , and gun - toting grannies pages for other legends of this type .) <PARA> unlike the tale of the timepiece presumed to have been stolen , every variation of the jogger ’ s billfold results in <PARA> the victim - turned - thief ending up with another ’ s property . this is not too surprising as one person ’ s money looks very much like another ’ s , whereas individual items such as wallets and watches are generally distinctive . the one attempting to reclaim what he thought was his would be likely to recognize his mistake while it is still correctable ; hence , those tales often include a failed assault on the “ thief .” <PARA> as folklorist jan harold brunvand put it , “ all variations on the theme of unwitting theft portray a plausible situation in which we ourselves might act in such an uncharacteristic threatening manner because of a simple misunderstanding .” human frailty and suspicion drive the action , impelling someone who would otherwise not have acted this way into relieving another of his property . that there is afterwards no way to redress the wrong by returning the item to its rightful owner drives home this tale ’ s lesson — that it is better not to take matters into one ’ s own hands . <PARA> barbara “ cache ‘ n ’ carry permit ” mikkelson <PARA> sightings : look for sylvester stallone as the “ thief ” of legend in the 1974 film the prisoner of second avenue . also , radio personality paul harvey told the “ stolen wallet ” tale during his 18 october 1972 broadcast .	
true	“ that thing ’ s like a big building sitting there ,” said motorists . the nose of the aircraft actually stuck out and over the interstate ! <PARA> the aircraft ’ s nose was so far over the end of the ramp , the crew was unable to see the runway where it was supposed to turn around so the pilot simply had to leave it at the end of the runway . the air force c - 5 galaxy , largest airplane in the free world , is almost as long as a football field and as high as a six - story building . <PARA> weighing 420 tons with a full load , it uses a system of 28 wheels to distribute its weight . the aircraft had to wait for a specially made tow bar trucked in from dover , delaware . when the tow bar arrived , it was used to hook the c - 5 to a tractor that then turned the aircraft around . the plane was not damaged . <PARA> origins : in the early morning of 6 march 2003 , an air force c - 5 galaxy transport plane landed at the norfolk naval station on a runway over an interstate highway ( i - 564 ). unfortunately , the plane ’ s pilot was unable to adequately see the end of the runway in the darkened conditions and stopped <PARA> the aircraft to avoid running off the pavement and into the mud , putting the plane in a position from which it could not be turned around under its own power . neither the norfolk naval station nor langley air force base in nearby hampton had a tow bar big enough to use with the c - 5 galaxy , which at 247 feet long and 65 feet tall is one of the largest aircraft in the world , leaving the military transport plane stuck above i - 564 for more than 16 hours while a special tow bar was trucked in from dover air force base in delaware . <PARA> meanwhile , the naval station ’ s chambers field was closed to all traffic save helicopters , and automobiles traveling to and from the base whizzed beneath the stuck c - 5 . the special tow bar arrived from dover around noon and was used to hook the aircraft to a tractor , which succeeded in getting the plane turned around and moved off the runway by 4 : 30 p . m . highway traffic was not disrupted , no one was injured , and the plane was not damaged .	
unproven	examples : <PARA> copying a plea <PARA> a xerox machine cannot be substituted for a lie detector , according to a recent ruling by a pennsylvania judge . <PARA> detectives of the bucks county police department were hellbent on getting a confession out of the suspect . but instead of resorting to the old rubber hose approach they put technology to use . they clearly [ sic ] converted the office xerox machine into a lie detector . <PARA> first , the supersleuths put a card saying “ he ’ s lying ” into the machine . then they put a metal colander ( normally used to drain spaghetti ) over the suspect ’ s head . next , they wired the colander to the xerox machine . <PARA> when the suspect gave an answer the detectives didn ’ t believe , the officers pushed the copy button and the machine spewed out a paper which read , “ he ’ s lying .” faced with such advanced - level police tactics , the fellow finally confessed . <PARA> when the judge heard all of the details , he ordered that the criminal charges be dropped and the suspect released . lucky for him there ’ s no law against gullibility . <PARA> [ collected on the internet , 1994 ] <PARA> a judge admonished the police in radnor , pa ., for pretending a xerox copy machine was a lie detector . officials had placed a metal colander on the head of a suspect and attached the colander to the copier with metal wires . in the copy machine was a typewritten message : “ he ’ s lying .” <PARA> each time investigators received answers they didn ’ t like , they pushed the copy button and out popped the message , “ he ’ s lying .” apparently convinced the machine was accurate , the suspect confessed . <PARA> origins : the colander lie detector story has been part of oral lore since <PARA> at least the late 1960s . so far , the oldest print sighting comes from an article in the 22 june 1977 edition of the philadelphia inquirer , which attributed the tale to “ a small police department in the county .” <PARA> a version placing the action in radnor , pennsylvania , appeared in news of the weird in 1989 . ( no source was given , so it ’ s now impossible to say where news of the weird picked up the tale from .) <PARA> the radnor version is by far the one most familiar to the online community . it routinely circulates in cyberspace , going through periods of dormancy followed by moments of revival when it seemingly makes its way into every inbox imaginable . <PARA> in an attempt to verify or prove the story false , folklorist jan brunvand contacted the radnor police department . their 10 october 1990 response stated : <PARA> the fake lie detector incident referred to in your letter did not happen in radnor . <PARA> we do not know how the story originated ; however , over the years , we have received numerous letters inquiring about this incident . <PARA> articles have been sent to us which appeared in the wall street journal , playboy , and other publications . <PARA> our guess is that some reporter had the story and used radnor as the place of occurrence . <PARA> sincerely , <PARA> maurice l . hennessy <PARA> chief of police , radnor township <PARA> we do not know how the story originated ; however , over the years , we have received numerous letters inquiring about this incident . <PARA> articles have been sent to us which appeared in the wall street journal , playboy , and other publications . <PARA> our guess is that some reporter had the story and used radnor as the place of occurrence . <PARA> sincerely , <PARA> maurice l . hennessy <PARA> chief of police , radnor township <PARA> throughout the years , this story has popped in various “ dumb criminals ” or “ true tales of the legal profession ” books , as well as surfacing every now and then in the media . its popularity continues undimmed , with ann landers airing it in her 4 january 1998 column . <PARA> could the story have happened ? it ’ s a remote possibility , and certainly police are tricky enough to want to try something like this , but one has to wonder about the metal colander detail . though it ’ s reasonable to expect to find cups , plates , and cutlery in a workplace kitchenette , <PARA> food preparation items are far less common . colanders are used to drain cooked pasta or wash salad ingredients ; they ’ re not exactly standard implements in even home kitchens . neither pasta draining nor lettuce rinsing are activities usual to a workplace setting , with the vast majority of lunch - bearers preferring to bring already - prepared meals to work , items that are ready - to - eat or require only a quick heating in the office microwave . <PARA> in other words , no matter how resourceful the officers were , they ’ d have had a time laying their hands on a colander to use in this deception . <PARA> tv police shows and movies routinely feature suspects being subjected to lie detector examinations . for the colander lie detector story to ring true , we have to suppose the hapless bad guy not only was unaware that results are not given as the test proceeds ( hence no machine spitting out “ he ’ s lying ” notes ), but also that all those guys on the big screen didn ’ t have metal colanders ( or anything else ) placed on their heads . it would take a truly dim bulb indeed not to realize something was terribly wrong with how the police were going about this interrogation . or that the printing device looked remarkably like a photocopier . <PARA> it ’ s still possible some police department somewhere did indeed act out this legend at one time or another . judging from the numerous verifiable “ dumb criminal ” stories afoot , no shortage exists of baddies who would willingly fall for it . but did it happen in as many places as now claimed ? very likely not — in common with a number of urban legends , numerous enthusiastic raconteurs have “ localized ” the tale by inserting the name of a nearby town . police departments everywhere have claimed this story as their own , perhaps as a way of reassuring themselves that the good guys do indeed win and their officers in particular are always two steps ahead of the criminals . <PARA> barbara “ wry detector ” mikkelson <PARA> sightings : this legend formed part of the plot of an episode of the television drama homicide .	
false	scam : job seekers are lured into wiring part of the cost of their airfare for travel to exotic interview location . <PARA> origins : typically , employment frauds in which gullible job seekers are duped into handing some of their money to con artists are designed to appeal to those seeking easy part - time work that can be performed at home ( e . g ., the reshipper scam , or various envelope stuffing cons ). this swindle , however , uses a different lure to entice the overly trusting down the primrose path : it holds out the prospect of glamorous work , often to be performed in exotic locales . <PARA> the scam is simple : newspaper ads offering high - paying travel - related positions are simultaneously run in a number of cities , or such job postings are listed online . whoever answers these ads is told he will be interviewed in a distant city for his dream job . almost as an afterthought , he will be informed the company requires him to wire money to cover a portion of his airfare , this being the corporation ’ s way of ensuring it isn ’ t wasting its resources on candidates that don ’ t bother to show up . the job prospect is given the promise of this sum ’ s being returned to him at his interview , making it seem to the pigeon that he will merely be out of pocket for a few days rather than lose the money permanently . all the while , the about - to - be - gulled is blinded with ongoing patter about fat pay checks , exotic locales , first - class accommodations , and life among the beautiful <PARA> people . <PARA> once the dupe has wired the specified sum to the thief working the con , he will either never again be contacted by the swindler ( who will ditch whichever disposable cell phone he used to make and receive these calls ), or he will be told there has been a change of plan , that instead of being jetted to some distant place for his tete - a - tete with higher management , he will be interviewed locally by a company representative sent to look him over . the local interview will , of course , fall through — it will either never be set up or it will be arranged then canceled . such additional back - and - forthing gives those running the con time to finish fleecing the other job seekers they ’ re working — by keeping the already - swindled from figuring out they ’ ve <PARA> been had , the risk is greatly reduced of some of them running to the police and so tipping the gendarmes to the need to stake out a particular western union office . by the time the police are summoned by irate job hunters intent upon recovering their money from the con artists who took them , the flim - flam men are long gone . and so is the cash . <PARA> the scheme has been successfully run both on those seeking employment as flight attendants serving aboard corporate jets and on those looking to work as security personnel servicing the rich and famous on very exclusive cruise lines . for instance , in october 2005 , a number of the denizens of the message boards at the robb report narrated their encounters with representatives of “ xanadu clubs international ,” an entity that presented itself through advertisements on a job search site ( careerbuilder ) as a private cruise club not available to the general public . according to the come - ons received from xanadu , this mysterious company was intent upon hiring people to provide security to the rich and famous on exclusive cruise lines . the catch was the hiring interviews were to take place in the turks and caicos islands , an island grouping 575 miles southeast of miami . while air travel to this location would be arranged by xanadu , applicants were required to wire the value of half the airfare to a company representative in advance of the interview , this condition being explained as the corporation ’ s way of ensuring it wasn ’ t squandering its resources on air tickets that would not get used . these monies would be refunded to the applicants at their interviews . <PARA> those who fell for the con wired the amounts requested ( often $ 268 ) to a western union in orlando , florida . they were subsequently told there had been a change of plans , that the interviews would instead be held locally . the funds advanced by the job seekers were not returned to them and the promised interviews never took place . <PARA> in another version of the same fraud , in the summer of 2005 , those answering newspaper ads for flight attendants for corporate jets offering $ 850 a week with full benefits were asked to send money orders via western union to cover half the cost of their airfare to the location where the interviews were being held , the bahamas . again , the promise of reimbursement at the interview was given . again , subsequent to the funds being sent , applicants were informed the interviews would instead be held locally , their monies not returned to them , and the interviews never took place . <PARA> earlier in 2005 , the scam was run in central florida , that time via advertisements for security guards for upscale cruise ships . security and jail guards sent money by western union to pay half the cost of plane tickets to miami or the philippines . they were told the company they would be interviewing with needed to ensure applicants were serious . then the interviews were canceled , and the money was gone . <PARA> although one might conclude from hearing of these recent defraudings the “ reimbursement for part of the airfare to the interview spot ” con was new on the street , we found evidence that it was used to fleece job seekers in 1992 . a six - line ad in california ’ s modesto bee announced that xanadu international needed flight attendants to staff its billion dollar fleet of new boeing 737s . “ airline flight attendants needed for our corporate aircraft ,” said the 15 june 1992 ad for the non - existent company . those who called the sacramento phone number listed in the ad were interviewed briefly over the phone , then directed to a number in chicago to speak with someone higher up in the company . another brief phone interview was held , then applicants were asked to come to the windy city for a final in -

made opportunity to ply their trade . <PARA> enter the “ gas coupon ” scam in which telemarketers offer $ 200 of gasoline vouchers in exchange for modest shipping and handling fees ( typically $ 2 or $ 3 ) debited from consumers ’ bank accounts or charged to their credit cards . those unwary souls who let their desire for something for <PARA> ( next to ) nothing get the better of them never receive the promised gas coupons — instead , they ’ re left to discover they ’ ve fallen victim to a flimflam as one unauthorized charge after another gets racked up against their accounts , often to the tune of several hundred dollars . <PARA> the crime is real , as is the warning about it . the alert quoted as our example began to be circulated in the online world in june 2004 . it was issued by greg abbott , the attorney general of texas , on 21 june 2004 . attorneys general of other states have issued similar cautions , including those of maryland and iowa . <PARA> the iowa attorney general specifically warns against doing business with a las vegas - based telemarketer who is peddling gas coupons purported to be worth $ 200 in exchange for a $ 1 . 95 checking account debit to cover shipping . that entity , variously known as continuity partners , cpi , american values , am values , wellnet , blitz media , washball , utalk , and u - talk - unlimited , is barred from doing business in iowa as a result of its having defrauded a number of folks in that state with this scheme . by order of the iowa attorney general , the multi - named company is required to refund monies taken from those iowans who fell for the con , but even those repayments have proved hard to collect , with some of the restitution checks bouncing like red rubber balls . <PARA> consumers in the tucson area have had to contend with u - talk - unlimited , one of the iterations of that las vegas - based telemarketer that was barred from iowa . u - talk - unlimited makes the gas coupon offer along with a free trial of a long - distance calling card . <PARA> in ohio , consumers were hooked by american values , another of those las vegas iterations . typical was the case of amy herrick , a chester township woman who had agreed to let american values debit her bank account for $ 1 . 95 charge for those gas coupons only to find she ’ d been drained of an additional $ 221 . 80 by companies she ’ d never heard of or agreed to do business with . as well as the $ 1 . 95 charge she ’ d authorized , there was a second $ 1 . 95 debit , a $ 79 . 95 hit for a washball ( a small plastic ball meant to be placed in a washing machine ), and $ 139 . 90 siphoning by utalk . <PARA> those living in kansas had to deal with continuity partners , still another of those las vegas iterations . defrauded kansans were gulled with an offer of $ 20 to $ 200 in gasoline vouchers in exchange for confirmation of a bank account number to cover the cost of shipping . once that confirmation was issued , money began to be drained from those accounts via unauthorized charges against them . <PARA> residents of virginia have also reported receiving calls from the multi - named las vegas - based telemarketer . those making the calls were said to have posed as representatives of the u . s . government offering $ 200 worth of gasoline coupons for a $ 3 . 95 shipping and handling fee . <PARA> continuity partners was forced by the oregon department of justice to make restitution to those oregonians it had cheated . according to the 12 february 2004 oregon doj press release , continuity partners had lied to those it contacted , claiming they had been selected to receive $ 200 in gasoline vouchers from the us government “ to help pay people back for the high gas prices ,” with these being redeemable at any of the major gas stations . others victims were told the promotion was sponsored by visa , and yet others were told they had been chosen in a random drawing of key customers of the major retailers . consumers were informed the only cost to them would be a $ 1 . 95 charge for shipping and handling charged to their credit cards . they were instead signed up for a 30 - day trial of a “ u - talk unlimited ” phone card , with said service triggering a credit card charge if at the end of the 30 days they didn ’ t opt out of the plan . <PARA> when caught with its hand in the cookie jar by oregon ’ s department of justice , the las vegas - based telemarketing company with the revolving names laid blame for its actions on difficulties in supervising an independent phone center and claimed it immediately terminated those involved when problems arose . in light of the multiplicity of instances of its running similar operations in other states , such claim should be viewed with skepticism bordering on outright disbelief . <PARA> our round - up of instances of this con being perpetrated in a few u . s . states represents just the tip of the iceberg and shouldn ’ t be viewed as the definitive list of all the places this scam is being worked . we present it only as an overview of how widespread the con has become and in what various fashions it has been executed . <PARA> if this story has a moral , it is that there is often a dark side to “ something for nothing ” schemes . our need to believe in the freebie is deeply ingrained and devoutly cherished , yet it is our very faith in this fiction that can work to set us up as pigeons , in that con artists need only wriggle this bait just a little to snare us in their webs . <PARA> barbara “ bargain hunters become the hunted ” mikkelson <PARA> how to avoid falling victim to unauthorized payment scams : <PARA> additional information :

false	origins : the classic “ halloween campus murders ” fright tale is a legend almost plague - like in its cyclicity , one that periodically resurfaces , spreads widely , and sends many students rushing home or barricading themselves inside their rooms during the weekend of ( or just before ) halloween . ( that each major outbreak of the rumor seems to occur several years after the previous iteration suggests that the legend takes hold anew once most of the students who <PARA> experienced the previous occurrence have graduated and moved on , making room for a new crop of youngsters who have never been exposed to it before .) <PARA> this story ’ s first known appearance was in the midwest in 1968 , perhaps inspired by richard speck ’ s murderous attack on nine nurses in a chicago rooming house a few years earlier . it has seen numerous outbreaks since then , most notably in 1979 ( midwest ), 1983 ( nationwide ), 1986 ( central pennsylvania ), and 1991 ( new england ), and it made a huge comeback in 1998 ( perhaps inspired by the release of the movie urban legend earlier that year ) when it spread across college campuses throughout the midwest . <PARA> the basic outline of the rumor is that a psychic has predicted a crazed killer will strike on a college campus on or near halloween , with the psychic providing only vague clues about which campus will be targeted — clues that are ambiguous enough to allow them to be applied to nearly every college campus in the country . nearly all the details of the legend — when and where the prediction was made , who the killer will be , what weapon the murderer will wield , which campus he will strike , what building the slayings will occur in , and how many students will be killed — vary according to where and when the legend is repeated . <PARA> some of the more common variations include the following : <PARA> the details included in the versions circulated during the 1998 outbreak of this rumor were : <PARA> even though this legend has been circulating for decades ( with nary a student falling victim to an axe - wielding bo peep in the meanwhile ), many students in 1998 were still being advised to not go anywhere alone and to watch out for “ suspicious ” individuals . although these are always wise precautions , one would hope the need to vacate dormitories in response to a legend has become unnecessary . the abundance of student newspaper articles collected below indicates that perhaps saner heads forestall further outbreaks of the legend . <PARA> as to how this legend got started in the first place , folklorist simon bronner noted in his collection of campus lore that “ the coincidence of the rumors with the darkening fall season , the mistrust of the security of institutional life — especially for students away from the haven of home — and the setting of many campuses in isolated arcadias undoubtedly feeds the rumors .” he suggested that as colleges eased the restrictions of dormitory life and took a much less active role in their students ’ personal lives , students came to see campuses as “ more open but less protected ” places , sites “ potentially open to dangerous strangers .” <PARA> update : this legend resurfaced in 2007 at kent state university ( ksu ) in ohio . we have not heard of outbreaks of the rumor at other u . s . schools that year .

false	once again the search for hidden meanings in the mundane has resulted in an interesting rumor about the supposedly acronymic origins of the name of a popular attirer . akin to the troop sport (“ to rule over oppressed people ”) and adidas (“ all day i dream about sex ”) canards , the rumor about the gap asserts that it drew its name from an initialization of the phrase “ gay and proud ”: <PARA> although the gap did begin in san francisco , a city home to a large homosexual population and strongly associated with gay pride , its name has nothing to do with either of those coincident facts . gap inc . was founded in 1969 by donald and doris fisher as a single store staffed by a handful of employees . the retailer took its name in homage to “ the generation gap ,” a term popular in the late 1960s describing the intellectual , ethical , and social gulf between young people and their parents ’ generation . <PARA> the inspiration for this first jeans - only store came from donald fisher ’ s frustrations as a consumer : he was finding jeans hard to shop for , having to travel to several different stores to examine a variety of brands because no one location housed them all . his experience , he figured , was likely a common one ; if it were , it indicated that a market for a jeans - only shop was present even if others in the retail field had yet to notice it . <PARA> gap inc . has since grown from its jeans - only beginnings to become one of the most popular clothiers of its age . the company employs more than 166 , 000 people worldwide and operates 3 , 800 stores under brand names including the gap , banana republic , old navy , athleta , and intermix . <PARA> “ gay and proud ” became a catchphrase within the gay community because it proclaimed in a positively - voiced manner that its members took pride in who they were rather than feeling ashamed of their lifestyle . it wasn ’ t that long ago that concealing all evidence of a same - sex preference was the order of the day , and the phrase “ gay and proud ” thus represented a major shift in how a community viewed both itself and the value of its individual members in society . <PARA> it is deeply ironic that a rumor would claim such a strong statement of pride would have been deliberately concealed from all but those in the know as an acronym . how “ proud ” would one have to be to want to exude such a message in a covert form ? <PARA> the implied shock factor in the gap rumor springs from the presumption that if it were true , wearers of gap merchandise would be unknowingly advocating a lifestyle they might or might not personally approve of .

false	once you receive this message please write down the number and then pass it along to every african <PARA> american you know . <PARA> as you my know , all african americans living here in the united states are descendants of slavery , <PARA> therefore our government has finally passed a bill to pay all descendants back . <PARA> the way they are paying us back is through a refund called the , “ black inheritance tax refund / 40 acres and a mule ”. <PARA> when you call this number you ’ ll give them your name , address , and phone number and they ’ ll send you out a packet , which includes further details and information on how to receive the refund . <PARA> i was informed that it will take only two weeks to receive the packet and then two weeks to receive the <PARA> money . now , if you know our government i bet they are not expecting a lot of people to call for this refund , and they may be right , because many of us will not be informed of this . <PARA> therefore , this is why i am taking it upon myself to pass on this information , so our community will soon be informed through word - of - mouth about what has been owed to our ancestors all these years . <PARA> black inheritance tax refund 1 - 800 - 441 - 5629 press # 3 to direct you to the appropriate line open between <PARA> east coast : 8am and 12am <PARA> west coast : 5am and 9pm <PARA> expect to wait anywhere from 5mins - 25mins ( there will not be any music to entertain you while you wait !) <PARA> ps : you must be 18 years or older and i ’ m assuming a legal residence of the united states . <PARA> so , request an application for yourself , husband , wife , sister , brother , father , mother , etc , or just pass the number along . <PARA> god bless you all and please check this out !!!!!!!! <PARA> origins : in 2000 , bogus letters claiming certain senior citizens were eligible for slavery reparations or higher social security payments were circulating in black churches in the south and elsewhere . the letters claimed blacks born before 1928 were eligible for a $ 5 , 000 “ negro inheritance tax refund ” due to a “ slave reparation act ,” and folks born between 1911 and 1926 might be entitled to higher monthly social security payments . <PARA> this was but one of the many forms the “ slavery reparation tax credit ” misinformation has taken over the years . an april 1993 lena sherrod commentary entitled “ forty acres and a mule ” which appeared in essence magazine dealt with the concept that reparations were owed to the descendants of african - americans who were forced to work unpaid for 246 years , and that african - americans were owed a tax rebate for years of legalized racial discrimination . sherrod wrote : <PARA> the government also owes african - americans a tax rebate for the 60 years of segregation and jim crow that followed slavery . although we were consigned by law to second - class citizenship , we were still forced to pay first - class taxes . . . the delinquent tax rebate [ is ] now estimated . . . to be at $ 43 , 209 per household .” <PARA> since de facto racial discrimination continues to function as a hidden black tax , it ought to be deductible . so when income - tax time rolls around , on line 59 of form 1040 — which asks you to list ‘ other payments ’ — simply enter $ 43 , 209 in ‘ black taxes ’ and compute accordingly . <PARA> since de facto racial discrimination continues to function as a hidden black tax , it ought to be deductible . so when income - tax time rolls around , on line 59 of form 1040 — which asks you to list ‘ other payments ’ — simply enter $ 43 , 209 in ‘ black taxes ’ and compute accordingly . <PARA> this commentary undoubtedly helped to foster the belief that a real income tax deduction was available as a form of reparation to the descendants of slaves . in 2002 , people were being urged in e - mail to call an 800 number . yet it ’ s all the same <PARA> hoax . <PARA> no matter whether you got the letter from your church or read about the give - back in a magazine , the “ reparations credit ” does not and never has existed . those who claim the deduction because they are black can be subject to fines and penalties , so really , really think twice before trying to wring it out of uncle sam . <PARA> the internal revenue service ( irs ) can fine a taxpayer $ 500 for filing a frivolous claim . moreover , if the tax department fails to catch the erroneous deduction at the time of filing , it has an additional six years to right its error . upon catching the error , the taxmen would not only strike off the deduction , but would calculate interest owed on the new balance of tax due , dating it to the year of the original return . ( for example , if you claimed the credit in 1994 , and the irs caught it in 1998 , your 1994 return would be re - computed to remove the effect of the bogus deduction . you ’ d now get a bill from the irs for the re - computed difference between tax paid and tax due , plus all the interest that had piled up on it across those four years , and maybe even a $ 500 penalty for trying to pull the wool over the tax department ’ s eyes . eeesh .) <PARA> irs offices across the nation have received thousands of requests daily for form 2439 , which some people have been mistakenly led to believe reimburses the descendants of slaves . form 2439 is actually for shareholders trying to claim undistributed capital gains . <PARA> though word of the phony benefits is most often spread by well - meaning individuals whose only motivation is ensuring those who are supposedly in line for the break hear about it , at times unscrupulous tax preparers have stepped in to turn what is already a heart - wrenching disappointment into an out - and - out fraud perpetrated on the unwary by charging fees of hundreds ( sometimes thousands ) of dollars to “ help ” people apply for these nonexistent benefits . <PARA> in a common version of this take - down , a con man promises his unwary clients that he can obtain up to $ 40 , 000 in “ slave reparation ” credits for them from the government and offers to file the necessary tax forms on their behalf in exchange for a percentage of their refunds . he then loads up his clients ’ tax returns with all manner of deductions and credits they ’ re not entitled to take and thereby scams the government into sending them refund checks . when the irs later goes over the returns more thoroughly and starts clamoring for their money back , the victims are left holding the bag . <PARA> the $ 43 , 209 “ black tax refund ” figure one sometimes hears bandied about is said to be based on the estimated value of “ 40 acres and a mule ,” a reparation supposedly laid out in an 1866 bill which lore claims was passed by congress but was vetoed by president andrew johnson . the truth is a bit more complicated than that . <PARA> the origins of the belief that the u . s . government promised 40 acres of land and a mule to freed slaves after the civil war are indefinite . one possible source of this claim is special field order no . 15 , issued in january 1865 by union general william tecumseh sherman , which set aside a coastal strip of land from charleston , south carolina , to jacksonville , florida , for the exclusive use of freed slaves , with each freed - slave family receiving a 40 - acre chunk of this holding . as eric foner noted in his history of reconstruction : <PARA> sherman was neither a humanitarian reformer nor a man with any particular concern for blacks . instead of seeing field order 15 as a blueprint for the transformation of southern society , he viewed it mainly as a way of relieving the immediate pressure caused by a large number of impoverished blacks following his army . the land grants , he later claimed , were intended only to make “ temporary provisions for the freedmen and their families during the rest of the war ,” not to convey permanent possession . understandably , however , the freedmen assumed that the land was to be theirs , especially after gen . rufus saxton , assigned by sherman to oversee the implementation of his order , informed a large gathering of blacks “ that they were to be put in possession of lands , upon which they might locate their families and work out for themselves a living and respectability .” <PARA> debate continues over whether sherman acted solely on his own authority in issuing special field order no . 15 or whether he had the approval of the war department ( or even president lincoln himself ), but the end result was that a new policy ( known as howard ’ s circular 15 ) issued by the white house in september 1865 ordered the restoration of land to pardoned owners and thereby took away from freedmen the land appropriated for them by sherman under special field order no . 15 ( the order made no provisions for giving mules to freedmen , but foner notes that after issuing it , “ sherman later provided that the army could assist [ freedmen ] with the loan of mules .”) <PARA> another possible source of the “ 40 acres and a mule ” belief is the creation of the freedmen ’ s bureau ( originally the bureau of refugees , freedmen and abandoned lands ), a federal agency established as a subsidiary of the war department in march 1865 ( a month before the end of the civil war ) to deal with issues concerning refugees and freedmen within states under reconstruction , including the management of abandoned and confiscated property . one of the provisions of the freedmen ’ s bureau act directed that the bureau ’ s commissioner should “ have authority to set apart , for the use of loyal refugees and freedmen , such tracts of land within the insurrectionary states as shall have been abandoned , or to which the united states shall have acquired title by confiscation or sale , or otherwise , and to every male citizen , whether refugee or freedman , as aforesaid , there shall be assigned not more than forty acres of such land .” however , this act did not propose giving property to freed slaves ( the land was to be leased to freedmen for three years , then made available for purchase by them ), nor did it make any mention of mules . <PARA> president johnson did not veto the freedmen ’ s bureau act , which was passed by congress in march 1865 and signed by president lincoln . ( johnson did not assume the presidency until lincoln ’ s assassination the following month .) two events occurred in february 1866 , both of which have been misstated as overturning the “ forty acres ” provision of the freedmen ’ s bureau act : <PARA> the southern homestead act of 1866 did in fact make land in five southern states available to freed blacks , but only public land , not plantations or other property confiscated from former slaveholders . unfortunately , most of the land still available in the south for homesteading was too swampy and too far away from transportation links to be of much good to freedmen , and even then the largest portion of this inferior land was claimed by whites ( often for quick resale to lumber companies ). <PARA> although the notion of a “ black inheritance tax refund ” has long since been debunked and disclaimed , it nonetheless lives on and continues to cause headaches to the irs and taxpayers alike . in april 2002 , the washington post reported that the irs had received more than 100 , 000 tax returns seeking nonexistent slavery - tax credits and had mistakenly paid out more than $ 30 million in erroneous refunds in 2000 and 2001 . and in april 2005 , the manhattan u . s . attorney ’ s office obtained a temporary restraining order enjoining a new york man from preparing income tax returns for others because he had “ been including bogus tax credits such as reparations for african - american slavery and segregation .” <PARA> barbara “ taxing the imagination ” mikkelson

unproven	examples : <PARA> one of the great mysteries of car - making is the way the japanese name their vehicles . the rule seems to be to pinch something unpronounceable from a foreign language and misspell it . <PARA> mitsubishi ’ s starion is the most famous example . they meant to call it stallion but ended spelling it the way japanese pronounce it . by the time this was pointed out , it was too late to make a correction , so the pr department concocted an explanation about stars from the orion constellation . 1 <PARA> it seems that mitsubishi ’ s chunky starion coupe was so christened as the result of a misheard conversation ‘ twixt occident and orient . american marketeers wanted a car called “ stallion ” as a rival for ford ’ s mustang : japanese phonetics did the rest . 2 <PARA> legend has it that mitsubishi ’ s 1980s sports car , the starion , was named that way when the japanese engineers struggled with the pronunciation of stallion . 3 <PARA> mitsubishi has been in trouble before , with the starion ; it was going to be the stallion until an american importer misunderstood a japanese attempt to pronounce the ls . 4 <PARA> origins : in 1983 , the japanese automobile manufacturer mitsubishi motors corporation broke into the <PARA> american car market with the introduction of several models in the usa , including the mitsubishi starion . didn ’ t take long for the somewhat unusual model name to prompt rumors about its origin : the starion was really supposed to be the “ stallion ,” but it ran afoul of a typical japanese pronunciation problem . it ’ s easy to see where this one came from : <PARA> stories such as this one should always be taken with a grain of salt , because they depend upon the premise of <PARA> a multi - national , multi - million - dollar company ’ s making its marketing decisions in a vacuum ( nobody in all of mitsubishi noticed the error or thought to question the name ), and , having caught their mistake , deciding that the model name of their first entry into the lucrative american market wasn ’ t important enough to merit correction . on the other hand , given that at the same time mitsubishi brought out the starion they also introduced a model with the rather unfortunate name of “ pajero ” ( a word which in spanish is a slang term for someone who enjoys pleasuring himself , prompting mitsubishi to judiciously rename the car the “ montero ” in some markets ), it ’ s sometimes hard to believe they don ’ t operate this way . <PARA> mitsubishi ’ s explanation that the name starion was a combination of “ star ” and “ orion ” didn ’ t convince many people who saw it as an obvious public relations face - saving fabrication . one newspaper article claimed the “ mistake ” explanation was apocryphal but “ was faintly encouraged at the car ’ s launch because it was more fun than the truth ” and that “ the name came from the star orion range of engines colt were using at the time ,” but we ’ ve found no confirmation of that theory . however , other models introduced by mitsubishi at the same time as the starion had similarly arcane names — the tredia , intended as a name reflective of the company ’ s three - diamond logo , and the cordia , a combination of “ cordorite ” ( supposedly a type of “ lustrous mineral ”) and “ diamond ” — so who knows ? as the daily telegraph wrote , the “ claim that the name is an amalgam of star and orion is daft , but then this is a company that called one of its economy cars the lettuce .” <PARA> in the mistake department , we ’ re still chuckling over an october 2000 article which , just before sneering at mitsubishi for choosing the model name “ pajero ,” relates the following amusing anecdote : <PARA> corporate history is littered with nomenclature disasters . one japanese car company nearly ended up with a sports car called a “ starion ” instead of a “ stallion ” because of language difficulties between japanese executives and their counterparts in a european advertising agency . 5 <PARA> we do hope they eventually manage to track down exactly which “ japanese car company ” nearly named one of their cars the “ starion ” — it sounds like a great story .	
true	origins : we ’ ve <PARA> grown used to thinking of society as always moving forward , even in its vices , thus we mistakenly assume this media - enriched generation is the first to see risqué advertisements . that is not the case , however — fifty - odd years ago consumers routinely encountered an ad that wouldn ’ t make it past the censors today . <PARA> in the 1940s , springs cotton mills ran a legendary advertising campaign executed in the form of a series of salacious print ads . “ be protected ,” reads the copy of one that depicts a young woman caught in a leaf - strewn wind .

false	could there be a more macabre marketing decision than naming a consumable confectionary treat after a dead little girl ? how about designing a recreational product to represent the instruments of war that obliterated tens of thousands of human beings ? who would do such a thing ? nobody , we hope , but such a claim has dogged motorcycle manufacturer harley - davidson for years , in the form of a rumor that their 1990 flstf “ fat boy ” bike was created as a “ tribute ” to the dropping of atomic bombs on japan at the end of world war ii . <PARA> why ? the answer to why harley - davidson would supposedly do such a thing is as a form of symbolic revenge on the japanese motorcycle companies who eroded the sales of good ol ’ american harley - davidson bikes during the 1970s and 1980s . the answer to why people would believe such a thing is a tale spun from a collection of manufactured coincidences : <PARA> all of this is just the fanciful product of someone ’ s imagination , however . the flstf is silver simply because it ’ s a nifty color for a motorcycle , the disc wheels were chosen for their look , the “ gold rings ” are merely styling touches added to accent certain parts of the bike , and the name “ fat boy ” comes from the observation that the motorcycle is rather wide when viewed head - on . but , as usual , an elaborate story about secret meanings is so much more interesting than plain old reality .

false	examples : <PARA> origins : in wartime and during the ramp - up towards war , leaders of opposing forces come to loom in our minds as demonic figures that are the embodiment of evil . because we like simple solutions to complex problems , the notion that if something happened to those men , the enemy forces they lead would fold their tents and sneak away into the night is seductive , hence the much - loved aphorism about killing a snake by chopping off its head . <PARA> consequently , rumors about the demise of enemy leaders are typical fare during times of political tension . throughout world war ii , persistent whispers about the secret deaths of hitler , mussolini , and tojo abounded , with similar buzz about stalin surfacing afterwards as events subsequently served to make him appear to be the next great threat to world peace . as rumor historian david jacobson said of our need for such gossip , “[ t ] he rumors make those who believe them feel stronger , more reassured , protected from their own fears as , with some well - whispered words , they destroy their enemies .” <PARA> it was to be expected that scuttlebutt of similar nature would attach to osama bin laden , the perceived <PARA> leader of al qaeda , yet the primary “ our enemy is no more ” rumor to have stuck to him posits his capture , not his demise . ( scattered “ osama dead ” hearsays have surfaced at various times , primarily in late 2001 and into 2002 , but these were eclipsed even back in those early days by “ osama captured ” fabrications . <PARA> possibly this apparent dilution was due in part to the perceived inequality in the strength of the combatants . it was the united states of america and its allies , after all , against one terrorist group , not two well - armed nations going at it . whereas a hitler or a tojo might have needed to die to give the average man on the street a sense of assurance that the war could be won , perhaps no similarly cataclysmic event need be provided in a conflict where the enemy forces aren ’ t viewed as a unified , national fighting force . but the difference could just as easily be attributable to death not being regarded as a great enough punishment for osama bin laden . at the heart of the “ dead leader ” rumors of world war ii lay the average person ’ s desire to see the threat to his personal safety lifted — though there was certainly room in the process for gleeful thoughts of retribution , compared to the war ’ s being brought swiftly to an end , the enemy ’ s leader being punished was not nearly as important an outcome . in the eyes of a western populace unaccustomed to acts of terrorism , the 2001 attacks on america were not instances of ordinary warfare . their mastermind was viewed as a murderer , not as a military leader , so the desire to see him humbled and brought in chains to face judgment ran at least apace with the yearning for a return to the pre - 2001 days of unquestioned safety . death may well have been thought too good for him . <PARA> “ osama captured ” whispers have been churning in the rumor mill since scant weeks after the september 11 attacks . in the years following the attacks , flagging financial markets have rallied on such chatter , turning downtrends into upswings . on 22 may 2002 , a two - day selling spree was momentarily reversed , sending the dow and the nasdaq to seasonal highs , after rumors that osama bin laden had been captured swept the trading floor . within 55 minutes , the dow shot up over 100 points . likewise , falling prices on the new york stock exchange were given a temporary shot in the arm on 20 august 2003 by a rumor that united states forces had captured osama bin laden . yet in terms of market rally , the most effective “ we got him !” rumor was the first , which occurred on 11 october 2001 . on the strength of that rumor , giddy investors helped push major stock indexes close to levels not seen since the september 11 attacks , lifting the dow by 167 points and the nasdaq by <PARA> beyond the vanilla form of the rumor about the contractor ’ s having been apprehended , there existed a sinister extension which added an important second element to the lore of the day : that the u . s . government was holding off announcing the capture of the head of al qaeda until the moment when it would do the president the most good in his re - election bid . we ’ ve been hearing this enhanced version of the basic rumor since early 2003 . by its lights , an american president unsure of his ability to hold the white house by more usual means had taken out an insurance policy against the fickleness of public opinion in the form of a much sought - after rabbit to be pulled from his hat at the last possible moment . according to scuttlebutt , the 2004 “ october surprise ” was to be the announcement that osama bin laden was in the custody of u . s . forces . <PARA> (“ october surprise ” was the name originally given to incumbent - engineered ploys designed to inspire voters to switch allegiance in the closing days of a presidential campaign , and it has since come to mean any unexpected development or event with the potential to decide an election . the term ’ s most prominent use came after the 1980 presidential election , when rumors spread that representatives working on behalf of ronald reagan made a secret deal with iranians to delay the release of american hostages until after the elections so that reagan ’ s opponent , president jimmy carter , wouldn ’ t score an “ october surprise ” boost of his own by negotiating their freedom before election day .) <PARA> the most famous airing of the “ osama has already been captured ” rumor came in december 2003 , when madeleine albright , secretary of state during the clinton administration , wondered aloud to fox news commentator morton kondracke if osama bin laden hadn ’ t already been captured , with the news being withheld until the president needed another hype in the polls . “ do you suppose ,” she asked , “ that the bush administration has osama bin laden hidden away somewhere and will bring him out before the election ?” albright subsequently claimed her remark was made in a jocular ‘ i ’ m pulling your leg ’ fashion , but kondracke said of albright ’ s manner that “ she was not smiling when she said this ,” and of the others who were in the room , “[ t ] hey didn ’ t think it was a joke ”: <PARA> [ lakely , 2003 ] <PARA> mrs . albright tried late yesterday to dampen the controversy over her remarks . “ last night , in the makeup room at fox news ,” she said , “ i made a tongue - in - cheek comment to mort kondracke concerning osama bin laden . <PARA> “ to my amazement , mr . kondracke immediately went on the air to repeat this comment , which was made to a person i thought was a friend and smart enough to know the difference between a serious statement and one that was not ,” she said . <PARA> “ my only regret is that the powder puffs were on mort ’ s face and not in his ears ,” she said . <PARA> mrs . albright tried late yesterday to dampen the controversy over her remarks . “ last night , in the makeup room at fox news ,” she said , “ i made a tongue -

jailed osama being served up as the 2004 u . s . presidential election ’ s october surprise was to believe any number of folks had kept news of such an arrest secret . although the conspiracy - minded could convince themselves the american forces involved in such an operation could have been ordered to hold their tongues and all the paperwork associated with the mission and detainment destroyed , nothing would account for the silence on the other side . supporters of osama bin laden would not have felt constrained to keep quiet about what had happened to him ; although they might not necessarily have rushed out to announce his capture to the world at large , discussion among them about what had happened would undoubtedly have created a good deal of “ chatter ” that would be picked up by others . <PARA> however , while logic disclaimed bin laden ’ s already being in custody , it did not preclude his capture during those last few pre - election days . the slim possibility existed that u . s . forces had pinpointed the location of their target but were deliberately delaying closing in on him until a specified date and were thereby manipulating the timing of such an event until the moment which would deliver the greatest advantage . this was neither a likely nor a reasonable scenario given that a terrorist in the hand was still worth two in the caves , but it did add spice to the drama of an already close presidential race . <PARA> bin laden ’ s end came in 2011 , not 2004 , though . on 1 may 2011 , president obama announced that osama bin laden had been killed in a military operation led by the united states in which a small team carried out the attack and took custody of bin laden ’ s remains . <PARA> barbara “ final curtain ” mikkelson

false	origins : although the clothier troop sport is no longer with us , a rumor tying this then - popular brand of expensive clothing to the ku klux klan still circulates . this brand of fashionable urban athletic wear was introduced in 1985 . it proved to be especially popular among african - americans and latinos (“ 95 % of our business was black or hispanic ,” said the company ’ s sales manager ), making it ripe for the standard “ minority consumers unknowingly exploited by the kkk ” rumor ( akin to the snapple slave ship and marlboro cigarette slanders ). <PARA> according to back fence gossip , this line of apparel took its name from an acronym formed from “ to rule over oppressed people ” and , since it was owned by the kkk , all profits from sales in the black community went to support white supremacists . ( the notion that the kkk would consider blacks “ oppressed ” apparently never struck the rumormongers as laughable .) in a widely - believed embellishment of the basic rumor , the kkk had inserted into the lining of troop jackets little slips of paper trumpeting either “ to rule over oppressed people ” or “ thank you nigger for making us rich ,” the latter phrase said to have been inscribed in the tread of troop ’ s tennis shoes as <PARA> well . <PARA> ( these claims of hidden messages in troop products could be read as an inverted form of the rattletrap legend , in which a disgruntled worker hides spiteful messages intended to irritate the rich customers who are supporting the exploitation of his labor ; in the troop legend , pleased owners hide spiteful messages intended to taunt the poor minority consumers they themselves are exploiting .) <PARA> rumors run on very fast legs , with more damning accusations added to them as they speed along . soon folks were insisting they ’ d seen ll cool j on the oprah winfrey show denounce troop as a kkk - run shop and rip off his troop jacket in a demonstration of disgust . ( oprah ’ s show is apparently the place to unmask evil corporations — the same theme of making a shocking revelation about a clothier shows up in the liz claiborne and tommy hilfiger canards .) or , in an inverted form of the rumor , ll cool j was accused of being a kkk pied piper leading his people to unwittingly finance white supremacy by popularizing troop clothing . <PARA> troop of course never had any ties to the ku klux klan or any similar organization . its founders were decidedly not kkk material : teddy and harvey held are jewish , and william kim is korean . not that such facts slowed the spread of the rumor ; once that ball was in play , it was going to stay there no matter what anyone said . trying to combat the rumor with a hands - on demonstration of its falsity , troop ’ s black marketing director , wesley mallory , sliced open the linings of five such jackets in a store in montgomery , alabama , to prove such messages weren ’ t hidden inside . <PARA> troop never did overcome the rumors that surrounded it , and less than five years after it began operations it was forced into bankruptcy . its owners discounted the effect of the slander on this outcome , citing bad business decisions and the public ’ s fickleness as the primary reasons for troop ’ s demise . but can that effect truly be discounted , especially in light of the many other companies that have succeeded at selling retail clothing to the same segment of the buying public , such as fubu ? <PARA> barbara “ f troop ” mikkelson	
unproven	examples : <PARA> here ’ s a true story to prove the power of unconditional guarantees : about a dozen years ago , a guy walked into the former fairbanks , alaska , nordstrom department store with two snow tires . he walked up to the tire counter , put the tires down , and asked for his money back . the clerk , who ’ d been working there for two weeks , saw the price on the side of the tires , reached into the cash register , and handed the man $ 145 . <PARA> [ newsweek , 1989 ] <PARA> the customer wanted to return a tire . never mind that the nordstrom department - store chain sells upscale clothing , not automotive parts . according to company lore , the clerk accepted the tire because that ’ s what the customer wanted . <PARA> origins : this is possibly the greatest consumer relations story of modern times — it ’ s certainly pointed to as such in a multitude of business articles . in this one simple vignette is captured the essence of what it takes to build and maintain a loyal client base : the customer is always right . . . even when he ’ s provably wrong . <PARA> nordstrom began in seattle in 1901 as a shoe store and grew into largest independent shoe chain in the united states . it was not until 1963 that nordstrom expanded into the clothing market to become the renowned nationwide fashion specialty chain it is today . <PARA> nordstrom has become synonymous with customer service in a way no other chain of stores has , with the “ tire refund ” legend doing its part to <PARA> bolster that image . nordstrom customers receive ‘ thank you ’ cards for shopping there . unusual requests are handled with aplomb by a knowledgeable sales staff . staffers have been known to hand - deliver special orders to customers ’ homes or even to obtain specialty merchandise from other stores for customers who ask for those items . those looking to return merchandise are not challenged to produce sales slips or nordstrom price tags for items which are clearly nordstrom stock . <PARA> which brings us back to our “ returned tire ” legend — did it happen ? the chain ’ s liberal return policy exists to assist nordstrom customers who have purchased merchandise that has proved unsuitable for their needs ; it ’ s not there to provide a dumping ground for whatever items shoppers might have purchased elsewhere . under this policy , items that could have been bought at nordstrom are accepted without question , but requests for refunds for items that could not have come from this retailer are turned down . <PARA> nordstrom has never sold tires : it vends clothing and shoes , items highly unlikely to be mistaken for automotive goods . yet , according to a 1995 book about the company , the tire story is true : <PARA> some legitimate “ heroic ” stories sound apocryphal . perhaps the most famous one — which the national press frequently cites — is the tale of the salesperson who gladly took back a set of automobile tires and gave the customer a refund . nordstrom has never sold tires , but the story is true . in 1975 , nordstrom acquired three stores in alaska from the northern commercial company , which did sell tires . so , when the customer — who had purchased the tires from northern commercial — brought them back to nordstrom , the return was accepted . nevertheless , the hyperbole reinforces the point and nurtures the mythology . 1 <PARA> should that claim be believed ? on the one hand , someone who asserts he was there when it happened swears to it : john nordstrom has been quoted as saying the customer seemed a bit confused but sincere , so the salesman gave him his $ 25 back , thanked him for coming in , and invited him back to shop : <PARA> more often , though , the company ’ s image was burnished by the service of its sales staff , such as the time in mid - 1970s when a salesman in fairbanks took back a $ 25 automobile tire , even though nordstrom didn ’ t sell tires . nordstrom had just expanded into a building that had been a tire store , said john nordstrom , who was there that day . the customer seemed a bit confused but sincere , so the nordstrom salesman gave him his $ 25 back and thanked him for coming in and invited him back to shop , john nordstrom said . 2 <PARA> on the other hand , john nordstrom , who says he was there , claims the legendary refund incident took place in a converted tire store . northern commercial company ( ncc ) operated department stores , auto dealerships , and tire centers in alaska , and in 1974 ncc sold three of those properties ( in anchorage , fairbanks , and kenai ) to nordstrom . however , according to the alaska commercial company ( the parent of the ncc chain ), the stores it sold to nordstrom were already department stores , not tire stores , so the notion that a customer confused a new nordstrom outlet for what had previously been a tire store doesn ’ t quite gibe . ( it ’ s possible that the older ncc department store included a tire department , but we haven ’ t been able to verify that <PARA> detail .) <PARA> this claim of someone having actually witnessed the incident is apparently only a recent phenomenon . the nordstrom “ tire refund ” tale has been recounted in numerous pieces about the company , many from the mid - 1980s , yet these far earlier sightings fail to make mention of the additional details now claimed , that this happened in 1975 , in a newly - opened store that had previously housed a tire shop , and with a member of the nordstrom family present . <PARA> moreover , a 26 december 1988 washington post article said of the legend : “ although nordstrom officials insist that the tire story is apocryphal , it does make a point about the seattle - based chain ’ s generous return policies .” more plainly , in 1988 the company insisted the tale was lore , not reality , but in 1995 one of its people began saying he saw it happen . <PARA> also , even in those sightings from mid - 1980 and onwards , the details of the incident vary wildly : <PARA> the wide variation in details coupled with the outright denial from the company in 1988 cast doubt on the 1995 john nordstrom account . at this impasse , common sense has to be consulted to see what guidance , if any , it has to offer . <PARA> it ’ s 1975 , and you live in alaska . you ’ re unhappy with one of the tires you recently purchased , so you head back to the tire store you bought it from . do you fail to notice that this space is now occupied by a seller of high - class men ’ s , women ’ s , and children ’ s clothing and shoes ? do you continue to mistake this clothing shop for a tire store , and instead stand there insisting that they make things right by refunding your money ? <PARA> common sense says even the most brain - dead of customers is going to notice at least some slight differences between a tire emporium and an upscale clothier ’ s , not the least of which is the smell . ( tire shops have a peculiar scent all their own .) common sense also says few ( if any ) clerks faced with such a request wouldn ’ t dazedly respond , “ well , there used to be a tire shop here , but we just bought the building from them .” <PARA> could such a customer have genuinely mistaken a nordstrom for a tire shop ? we don ’ t think so . could a customer intent upon testing nordstrom ’ s famed return policy have come in rolling a tire in front of him , playing at being confused for the sake of a bar story ? it certainly lies within the realm of possibility , but the much stronger possibility is that the incident was as nordstrom described it in 1988 : apocryphal . <PARA> interestingly , nordstrom is not the only firm to lay claim to the legend , as this passage from built from scratch , a history of home depot , shows . the speaker is bernie marcus : <PARA> that reminds me of a story about our executive vice president of operations and group president , larry mercer , that became legendary within the company : <PARA> one day , a man came into one of our atlanta stores with a set of automobile tires , demanding a refund . the home depot doesn ’ t sell tires – never did , even when we sold some other automotive supplies – so the person running the service desk called mercer for help . <PARA> “ sir ,” mercer said , “ if you bought them here , what did you pay for them ?” <PARA> the man named a figure . mercer reached into the cash register and handed the man the exact amount without another word . <PARA> then mercer hung the tires over the service desk to remind everybody : “ the customer is always right .” 3 <PARA> one day , a man came into one of our atlanta stores with a set of automobile tires , demanding a refund . the home depot doesn ’ t sell tires – never did , even when we sold some other automotive supplies – so the person running the service desk called mercer for help . <PARA> “ sir ,” mercer said , “ if you bought them here , what did you pay for them ?” <PARA> the man named a figure . mercer reached into the cash register and handed the man the exact amount without another word . <PARA> then mercer hung the tires over the service desk to remind everybody : “ the customer is always right .” 3 <PARA> barbara “ tire mire ” mikkelson <PARA> sightings : in an episode of the television sitcom cybill (“ the big , flouncy thing ,” original air date 29 september 1997 ), when zoey asks about returning to a store a dress cybill snipped a decorative feature from , maryann replies “ oh , pish . i ’ ve returned snow tires here .”	
false	# 1 mainstream top 40 airplay chart hits off a debut album and in 2010 garnered two grammy awards : best dance recording (“ pokerface ”), best electronic / dance album (“ the fame ”), plus had been nominated in three other categories : record of the year (“ pokerface ”), song of the year (“ pokerface ”), and album of the year (“ the fame ”). <PARA> her unique costuming and makeup , strong performance skills , and outrageous persona easily set her up as the target for rumor . in a reprise of the canard that has long dogged actress jamie lee curtis , in 2009 whispers grew in the online world that lady gaga was an hermaphrodite , a person possessed of both male and female sex organs . <PARA> the tipping point appears to be a frame taken from live footage of lady gaga during a performance in august 2009 in which she appeared wearing a red dress and leaning against a blue motorcycle . in that photo , reclined as she was against the bike , her underthings can , and have been ( at least by some ), mistaken for a vestigial penis . <PARA> prior to speculation over that video , this rumor surfaced as part of a december 2008 blog entry on starrtrash (“ lady ga - ga admits true sex ”), purportedly written by the artist herself , in which the singer “ confirmed that she indeed is a hermaphrodite .” that tidbit was picked up and reposted on various internet sites stripped of the context that indicated it to be satire — should there be any doubt as to its veracity , even the briefest of glances at the other offerings on the site where it originally appeared reveals that the nature of that venue is to lampoon celebrities of the day via articles such as “ angelina jolie steals asian child ” and “ gwen stefani leaves mandarin [ a chinese restaurant ] 100 pounds fatter .” <PARA> in august 2009 , lady gaga ’ s manager responded to rumors of the singer ’ s purported hermaphroditism with the brusque statement “ this is completely ridiculous .” the following month , lady gaga said of the rumor on australia ’ s fox fm radio station that “ it ’ s too low - brow for me to even discuss ,” but later answered gonzo radio jocks in that country who asked “ where are we at right now with the tiny penis issue , lady gaga ?” with “ my little vagina is very offended . i ’ m not offended , my vagina is offended .” <PARA> by december of that year she was neither waving off nor parrying with humor such queries and was instead addressing them directly . veteran television interviewer barbara walters , who picked lady gaga as one of her ten most fascinating people of 2009 , put the question to her and received this response : <PARA> for those who don ’ t fancy placing full faith in any one celebrity ’ s word , particularly where potentially delicate matters are concerned , we note that no one ( of either sex ) whom lady gaga has been intimate with has reported having come across any surprises of a penile nature . given the all too often baseness of human nature and the high degree of interest the tabloids would have in such an intelligence , lady gaga ’ s word plus the thunderous silence of those she has befriended should serve to put this canard to rest .	
false	by james wallace <PARA> seattle post - intelligencer reporter <PARA> contractors : a dedicated group of engineers that circle the country seeking the next high paying job . <PARA> contractors rarely if ever receive pay for time not worked . they usually have very few benefits although some receive incentives such as holiday pay , per diem , and longevity bonuses . diem is a daily tax free living expense paid to the contractor . longevity bonus is usually one weeks pay or other amount paid after an established period of time , normally on completion of one year ... <PARA> contractors are known for showing up for work sick and / or injured in order to collect the incentives that they depend on , or to get paid for overtime , which is one and a half times their hourly pay . boeing has <PARA> documented many instances where contractors have gone through extreme lengths in order to show up for work . <PARA> “ we have seen people do extraordinary things before , but nothing like this ,” said randy saseler , boeing ’ s vice president of engineering . “ i am sure this is a first .” <PARA> contractor shows up to work dead . <PARA> at 5 : 00am <PARA> saturday morning ( jan . 29 ) wanda robertson , the wife of contractor peter robertson , rolled her dead husband into a renton , wa , boeing facility , using the dead man ’ s badge in order to gain entrance . she entered the building before most staff show up for work . <PARA> “ i thought it was some kind of a joke ,” said former co - worker david palmer . “ that coffin was in the corner for about a week ; we thought the company was setting up some sort of show . we just ignored it . geez that was peter ?” <PARA> mrs . robinson is facing charges of trespassing on boeing property . according to a statement she filed with renton police , mr . robertson was 1 week shy of collecting his longevity bonus ; he would also have forfeited his per diem payment . mrs . robertson said that since he was physically at work , boeing must pay him . “ the kids and i really need that money .” <PARA> “ we are educating ourselves about the legal aspects of this case . we have never had a case where a dead man continued to come to work . this is highly unusual . obviously this woman is in need . we are considering paying her the money her husband would have received , as well as her husband ’ s burial costs . we will however , add a clause in our contracts so that this does not happen again ,” tim clark , boeing spokesman , recently told the industry publication flight international magazine . “ we just do not want dead people thinking that they can or should continue to come to work .” <PARA> origins : we first began finding this purported news story in our inbox in february 2005 . according to the jape , a mercenary wife extracted the last bit of earning power from her dead husband by wheeling <PARA> him into work at boeing and leaving him there for the final week required for him to be eligible for his bonus . <PARA> although clever wives are not fiction , this story is . there was no such deceased contract worker , nor was the account of the man ’ s final week on the job a news story that ran in the seattle post - intelligencer . possibly its anonymous writer intended the piece as a humorous take on what is sometimes perceived as the basis of how contract workers are compensated , that they are paid for their time on the job , not for what they do there . <PARA> the anonymous hoaxster did make an effort to dress out his offering about a dead contractor being wheeled in his casket into work at boeing and left there for a week with the appearance of credibility . seemingly appropriate names were included in the hoax to make the leg - pull appear more believable . first , the airplane manufacturer does have a sizeable facility in renton , washington . second , james wallace is the seattle post - intelligencer ’ s aerospace reporter and , as such , his would be the most appropriate name to list as the author of any newspaper article about boeing . ( the real james wallace of the seattle post - intelligencer did not write this piece though , as he himself told us when we called him .) <PARA> also , the fake news story claims randy saseler is boeing ’ s vice president of engineering . while boeing has a number of vice presidents of <PARA> engineering ( one per division , it seems ), none of them bears that name . they do employ a randy baseler as their vice president of marketing . <PARA> possibly the unknown prankster drew his inspiration from a june 2000 conseco television commercial . the ad shows an unmoving man wearing sunglasses seated at a desk . throughout the day various assignments are placed on his desk and then picked up , completed , and dropped back at his desk by co - workers . at the end of the day the wife appears to pick him up . she is complimented on her husband ’ s diligence and performance , shoos the appreciative co - worker away , closes the door to her husband ’ s office , and begins to prepare him to leave . the voice - over on the commercial comments on how it ’ s important to be prepared for the unexpected , leaving behind the unstated message that otherwise you too might have to day after day prop your dead husband at his desk at work to keep those paychecks coming in . <PARA> the fake story about the deceased contract worker echoes another yarn from 2000 about a proof reader found dead at his desk after five days . though the sad tale about george turklebaum was repeated as true in a few newspapers , it too was fiction . <PARA> barbara “ dead reckoned ” mikkelson <PARA> sightings : a couple of our readers recall viewing a somewhat similar skit on the television sit - com not the nine o ’ clock news . in it , a union representative appealed for overtime pay and a promotion for the dead worker who , having been strapped to a heating radiator by his desk , had “ been available for duty 24 hours a day for the last month .”	
unproven	examples : <PARA> there ’ s an urban legend that albert einstein once said compounding [ interest ] is the most powerful force in the universe . <PARA> whether or not he really said it , that line has become my financial motto . i strongly suggest you adopt it . <PARA> [ hartgill , 1997 ] <PARA> when asked to name the greatest invention in human history , albert einstein simply replied “ compound interest .” <PARA> origins : many homeowners who have struggled to meet their <PARA> mortgages month after month , only to find after years of making payments that most of their money has gone to cover interest charges , have felt like cursing whoever came up with the concept of compound interest . in that vein , around 1980 ( when the neutron bomb and soaring interest rates were prominent news topics ) johnny carson once quipped during a tonight show monologue that “ scientists have developed a powerful new weapon that destroys people but leaves buildings standing — it ’ s called the 17 % interest rate .” perhaps that explains why many of us seem to recognize a kindred spirit in the declaration by one of the greatest intellects of our time , albert einstein , that compound interest is “ the most powerful force in the universe ” or “ the greatest invention in human history .” ( since no context is ever offered for this purported quote , readers might also fairly assume that its intent was to praise compound interest as a wonderful device that allows thrifty savers to realize a significant , low - risk return on their money .) <PARA> but did the eminent physicist really ever say such a thing ? the claim that he did appears dubious for a couple of significant reasons : <PARA> we suspect that this perspective on the power of compound interest is a fairly modern invention , one which has been retroactively placed into the mouth of a prominent dead person to give it more punch .	
true	examples : <PARA> there exists an american express card “ above ” the platinum . the name is supposed to be “ the sky ’ s the limit ,” and the card is supposed to be sky blue with puffy white clouds on it ( i kid you not ). <PARA> [ collected on the internet , 2003 ] <PARA> is there such a thing as a black american express card ? i was told by someone in a local pub ( i live in the uk ) that american express issue black american express cards the super wealthy . people like bill gates and michael jackson . i was told that you cannot apply to have a black amex but are instead invited by the company to have one — as long as you agree to keep is existence as secret as possible . <PARA> origins : every now and then , a long - lived rumor spawns a real - life counterpart when someone in the business world comes to the startling realization that there is corporate gold to be mined by cashing in on what people are already committed to believing . thus , thanks to the infamous $ 250 cookie recipe legend neiman - marcus now sells a chocolate chip cookie , and mcdonald ’ s ( on behalf of its ronald mcdonald houses ) collects pull tabs for a charitable <PARA> cause . <PARA> another potential entry in this category is american express , a company dogged for years by a rumor that it handed out black amex cards entitling holders to purchase anything up to jet fighters and beyond . while people insist a few of those fabled cards were provided to the ultra - privileged ( those who had millions of dollars in american express bank accounts ; imelda marcos and the like ) from 1984 to 1987 , and a 1988 wall street journal article appears to support that claim , whatever the truth about those chargeplates of lore , in 1999 the corporation finally bowed to the belief and began openly offering a real card at least somewhat in line with the rumor . <PARA> ( it ’ s possible amex issued a special card that wasn ’ t a chargeplate to the super - privileged back in the 1980s . that 1988 wall street journal article described the black card as “ high - class id for check - cashing ” even as it made clear nothing could be charged on the card ; amex cardholders were still required to use their platinum , gold , or green cards to make purchases .) <PARA> in 1999 american express announced the introduction of its centuriontm card . available only by invitation to selected platinum card members , this black credit card promises to simplify the lives of the harried rich . in exchange for its hefty annual fee ( initially $ 1 , 000 us , but now $ 2 , 500 ), cardholders receive automatic upgrades on fifteen of the world ’ s leading airlines . they also receive assistance in securing hard - to - come - by tickets for popular events , reservations at trendy restaurants , and shopping for christmas gifts . someone from the service will even call to remind cardholders of upcoming anniversaries . it is akin to having a personal concierge always on call . <PARA> “ there had been rumors going around that we had this ultra - exclusive black card for elite customers ,” says doug smith , director of american express europe . “ it wasn ’ t true , but we decided to capitalize on the idea anyway . so far we ’ ve had a customer buy a bentley and another charter a jet .” <PARA> other card member tales : <PARA> according to cardholder and record producer nellee hooper , the centurion “ arrives at your house with a security guard . you get this big , black , velvet - lined box , with a special mini - computer and two black cards in it , one for business , one for pleasure .” if you put your card in the mini - computer , it tells you how much you ’ ve spent . <PARA> hooper was probably attempting to add to the black card ’ s mystique by speaking with his tongue planted in his cheek , however . some of our readers who possess centurion cards have reported that their new plastic arrived with no hoopla at all , nary a security guard nor a mini - computer . they did receive two cards , but it wasn ’ t a case of one card for business and one for pleasure — one card was the centurion charge card and the other was a ‘ priority pass ’ ( also black and gold ) which allows them into first - class lounges the world over but can ’ t actually be used to pay for anything . <PARA> yet for all of its snob appeal , the centurion is still a thing of mystery . though we located numerous references to it on the american express web site , nothing we came across explicitly outlined its eligibility requirements or benefits . the card cannot be applied for ;

the windows shook , the dishes on the table rattled and a minute later the flowers on the table were dead . while keeping an ear tuned in on the conversation in the hallway , and keeping his promise of staying blindfolded , he carried on like this for the next 10 minutes , farting and then fanning each time with his napkin . <PARA> when he heard the phone farewells ( indicating the end of his loneliness and freedom ) he neatly laid his napkin on his lap and folded his hands on top of it . smiling contentedly , he was the picture of innocence when his wife walked in . apologising for taking so long , she asked if he had peeked at the dinner table . after assuring her he had not peeked , she removed the blindfold and yelled “ surprise !” <PARA> to his shock and horror , there were twelve dinner guests seated around the table . <PARA> as wonderful as this tale is , it ’ s clearly more fiction than truth . even blindfolded , the fellow would have been sure to pick up on the presence of twelve dinner guests ;

( the same is true of some other large oil companies , such as sinclair and sunoco ). <PARA> consumers wishing to purchase gasoline from retailers whose product does not originate in middle eastern countries can accomplish their goal by patronizing hess service stations , of course , but not because hess has a corporate policy of supporting israel .	
false	variations : in march 2001 , a slightly - rewritten version began circulating on the internet , this one transforming dear dead george into a geologist working for an oil company in calgary , alberta . one especially adorable difference between this version and the earlier incarnation is the closing comment by turklebaum ’ s boss , elliot wachiaski , which attempts to explain why no one noticed turklebaum ’ s deceasitude : “ besides he was a geologist , they never really do much anyway .” <PARA> origins : what a fable for <PARA> our times ! nearly all of us feel we ’ re spending too much time at our jobs , are anonymous cogs in corporate machines whose disappearance ( or death ) would scarcely be noticed by our co - workers and employers , and are spending our lives at work ( literally ). <PARA> so of course people took to the story of dead - but - undiscovered george turklebaum , which the birmingham [ england ] sunday mercury claimed to have broken when it reported his death as a “ crazy worlds ” item on 17 december 2000 ( even though the same item , minus some of the details , had been run by the guardian and the bbc a few days earlier ). the story of turklebaum ’ s tragic demise was picked up and printed by several other newspapers in great britain ( including the london times ) in december and january and soon garnered a tremendous amount of attention ( especially in birmingham , alabama , as confused readers mistakenly bombarded that city ’ s newspapers with queries about turklebaum ). in response to all the inquiries it received , on 28 january 2001 the sunday mercury published the following : <PARA> well of course the story is true ! <PARA> the sunday mercury ’ s crazy world spots are compiled by journalist keith chalkley — a man with a midas touch for finding strange goings - on in every corner of the globe . <PARA> keith said : ‘ i was first alerted to george ’ s story by a new york radio station i broadcast to . <PARA> ‘ but new york police , to whom i spoke , say the case isn ’ t as odd as people might think . <PARA> ‘ in 1975 , an insurance clerk with a firm in manhattan died in his workplace — and it was 18 days later that it was found that he was dead .’ <PARA> the sunday mercury ’ s crazy world spots are compiled by journalist keith chalkley — a man with a midas touch for finding strange goings - on in every corner of the globe . <PARA> keith said : ‘ i was first alerted to george ’ s story by a new york radio station i broadcast to . <PARA> ‘ but new york police , to whom i spoke , say the case isn ’ t as odd as people might think . <PARA> ‘ in 1975 , an insurance clerk with a firm in manhattan died in his workplace — and it was 18 days later that it was found that he was dead .’ <PARA> what satisfied the sunday mercury didn ’ t satisfy us , and it shouldn ’ t have satisfied anyone else : <PARA> this one was a hoax , no matter how the sunday mercury tried to spin it . it ( and others ) got suckered by a 5 december 2000 article from the weekly world news ( a supermarket tabloid ), which was almost word - for - word identical with the version the mercury printed : <PARA> ( notice that the sunday mercury ‘ s follow - up “ this really is true !” article quotes its “ reporter ” as having spoken to the new york police and been told that “ the case isn ’ t as odd as people might think ” and that “ in 1975 , an insurance clerk with a firm in manhattan died in his workplace — and it was 18 days later that it was found that he was dead ” — information straight from the concluding paragraph of the weekly world news piece .) <PARA> the turklebaum saga is a prime example of why we stress repeatedly that the appearance of a news story in one or more newspapers ( even respected publications such as the london times ) is no guarantee of its truthfulness . extraordinary news requires extraordinary documentation , which is something more than a bevy of newspapers simply running the same unsourced piece . <PARA> the passing of people who have died at their desks hasn ’ t always been discovered immediately , but at no time has there been a five - day span between death and discovery . in february 2011 , los angeles county worker rebecca wells ( 51 ) expired at her desk on a friday , with her body being discovered on saturday afternoon by a security guard . <PARA> in january 2004 several news outlets picked up a similar story from the finnish tabloid ilta - sanomat , which claimed that a tax office official in finland died at his desk , but his death went unnoticed by up to 30 colleagues for two days . unlike the passing of rebecca wells , that story is unconfirmed . <PARA> sightings : a june 2000 conseco television commercial anticipated ( and maybe even have inspired ) this fake news story about george turklebaum . the ad showed an unmoving man wearing sunglasses seated at a desk . throughout the day various assignments were placed on his desk and then picked up , completed , and dropped back at his desk by co - workers . at the end of the day the wife appears to pick him up . she is complimented on her husband ’ s diligence and performance , shoos the appreciative co - worker away , closes the door to her husband ’ s office , and begins to prepare him to leave . the voice - over on the commercial comments on how it ’ s important to be prepared for the unexpected , leaving behind the unstated message that otherwise you too might have to day after day prop your dead husband at his desk at work to keep those paychecks coming in .	
true	yesterday , i was driving into town along the southwest freeway around 12 : 30 pm . i was in the far left lane doing the posted speed limit of 65 and going with the flow of traffic . when i got over the bissonnett / braeswood overpass , there was an hpd squad car parked on the left shoulder with the officer standing out in front of his vehicle pointing his radar gun at oncoming cars . your inclination automatically tells you to slow down , whether you were speeding or not . <PARA> not a 1 / 2 mile down the freeway , there was another hpd officer that had someone pulled over on the left shoulder giving the person a ticket . i thought , man this was an obvious speed trap and kept on going . i had slowed down to around 60 at that point as now the posted speed limit was 60 . <PARA> about a mile up the road , around gessner , another hpd officer had someone else pulled over to give them a ticket and literally in front of that traffic stop was another hpd officer ( yes we are up to 4 cop cars now in about a mile ) walking around to the front of his car . just as i was approaching him , he pointed his radar gun at me and signaled for me to pull over . i was shocked , because i know that i was going the posted speed limit ( 60 ) as i immediately looked at my speedometer . <PARA> the officer came to my window and said “ do you know how fast you were going ?” i said yes , i was going 60 . he said “ you were doing 58 ” and he showed me his radar gun , which read 58 . i said okay . he said “ you failed to slow your speed down by 20 mph or move over to the adjacent lane when an emergency vehicle was stopped in the flow of traffic .” i said , i did not know that was a law ( of course that is never a defense ) and he said it was and asked for my license . the officer wrote me a ticket that carries a $ 200 fine for this infraction . <PARA> come to find out , this is a new state law as of september 1 , 2003 . from the tx dps website , the law reads : <PARA> sb 193 requires drivers nearing a stopped emergency vehicle that has lights activated , unless otherwise directed by a law enforcement officer , to : <PARA> vacate the lane closest to the emergency vehicle , if the highway has two or more lanes traveling the direction of the emergency vehicle ; or <PARA> slow to a speed not more than 20 miles per hour ( mph ) less than the posted speed limit when the posted speed limit is 25 mph or more ; or <PARA> slow to a speed not more than five mph when the posted speed limit is less than 25 mph . <PARA> a violation is a punishable by a maximum fine of $ 200 . if the violation results in property damage , the maximum fine increases to $ 500 . if the violation results in bodily injury , the offense is enhanced to a class b misdemeanor . <PARA> it was signed by the governor on june 18 and became law on 9 / 1 . <PARA> origins : on 1 september 2003 , a new traffic law went into effect in the lone star state . troopers didn ’ t strictly enforce it for its first ninety days on the books ( they began ticketing in earnest only in december 2003 ), which is why reaction to this new measure didn ’ t begin to surface until <PARA> three months after one might have expected it to . <PARA> the “ move over act ” ( sec . 545 . 157 of the texas transportation code ) requires motorists approaching emergency vehicles that are stopped with their lights flashing by the sides of roads to move out of the lanes closest to these vehicles or to reduce speed to 20 mph under the posted limit . ( if the speed limit is less than 25 mph , motorists must slow to 5 mph .) this law was intended to reduce the number of injuries to police officers , paramedics , ambulance workers , and fire fighters who have all too often been winged by cars whizzing past sites where they were attempting to <PARA> carry out their duties . <PARA> “ the whole idea of that law is to keep people from running over us ,” said kyle coleman , a lieutenant with the bexar county sheriff ’ s department . “ it ’ s a real nerve - racking experience . you feel the wind from the ( side ) mirror slide across your back .” <PARA> “ people were not slowing down and it ’ s very dangerous for the emergency services personnel to be on the side of the road ,” said tela mange , a spokeswoman for <PARA> the texas department of public safety . “ they are very vulnerable . there oftentimes are wrecks because people are not paying attention or are more interested on what ’ s going on in the side of the road .” <PARA> many of those who serve have been killed by careless motorists . in 2003 , among the police officers killed nationwide , 13 were struck by vehicles while they were on duty outside of their vehicles . <PARA> in the five years since we originally published this article many other states have passed “ move over ” laws , the latest being new york , which in january 2011 enacted a law requiring drivers approaching a stationary emergency or maintenance vehicle with flashing lights to move to the next adjacent lane if it is safe to do so , and , barring that , to reduce their speed . all states except hawaii and the district of columbia now have some form of “ move over ” law on the books , as do many of the canadian provinces . <PARA> a january 2010 message circulated by e - mail claimed that a new “ move over ” traffic law had been implemented in california just that month : <PARA> in california , the “ move - over ” law became effective on january 1 , 2010 . <PARA> i wanted to let my friends know about the ca move over law . my son got a ticket on pleasant hill coming back from wal - mart . a police car ( turned out it was 2 police cars ) was on the side of the road giving a ticket to someone else . my son slowed down to pass but did not move into the other lane . the second police car immediately pulled him over and gave him a ticket . my son and i had never heard of the law . it is a new law that states if any emergency vehicle is on the side of the road , if you are are able , you are to move into the far lane . <PARA> the cost of the ticket was $ 754 , with 3 points on your license and a mandatory court appearance . please tell everyone you know ( that drives ) about this new law . <PARA> i wanted to let my friends know about the ca move over law . my son got a ticket on pleasant hill coming back from wal - mart . a police car ( turned out it was 2 police cars ) was on the side of the road giving a ticket to someone else . my son slowed down to pass but did not move into the other lane . the second police car immediately pulled him over and gave him a ticket . my son and i had never heard of the law . it is a new law that states if any emergency vehicle is on the side of the road , if you are are able , you are to move into the far lane . <PARA> the cost of the ticket was $ 754 , with 3 points on your license and a mandatory court appearance . please tell everyone you know ( that drives ) about this new law . <PARA> however , california ’ s “ move over ” law was actually passed in 2006 and implemented in 2007 , and the standard penalties for violating it are exaggerated in the e - mail : <PARA> california has had a “ move over , slow down ” law for several years . the law that took effect jan . 1 [ 2010 ] made it permanent and added caltrans trucks to the list of vehicles you must make way for , which includes police cars , fire engines , ambulances and tow trucks . if you see an emergency vehicle on the side of a highway with lights flashing , you must slow down and move into an adjacent lane if it is safe to do so . the fine [ for violating this law ] is around $ 146 , with one point on your record . <PARA> ( although the monetary fine specified in the california vehicle code for an infraction of this type is “ not more than $ 50 ,” the state and the county where the infraction took place typically impose additional penalty assessments and surcharges , so the total fine paid can vary from county to county and is likely to be around the $ 146 figure mentioned above .) <PARA> barbara “ slow down and save the life of someone who may one day save yours ” mikkelson	
false	origins : effective satire hews closely to what people are inclined to believe , and since a significant portion of the u . s . electorate already harbors enmity towards new york senator hillary clinton and / or regards illinois senator barack obama as having a deliberately obscured and potentially dangerous background , it ’ s not surprising a spoof article claiming that the ku klux klan has endorsed the latter for president ( since “ anything is better than hillary clinton ”) would gain currency . <PARA> however , the “ british newspaper ” that originated the above - quoted article is the daily squib , which describes itself as “ a satirical publication [ that ] should therefore not be taken too fu ** ing seriously .”	
unproven	origins : in the 18th century , mercury salts were used to make felt for fancy hats . the process required copious amounts of the element , a substance then not understood to be as dangerous as we now know it to be . <PARA> hat makers who day after day handled mercury - soaked fabric risked mercury poisoning , a condition that affects the nervous systems . those so exposed would in time develop uncontrollable twitches and trembles , making them appear demented to the casual observer . <PARA> even though there exists a strong tie between mercury poisoning and strange behavior in those long - ago hatters , it ’ s still more than likely the term we now toss about so casually did <PARA> not spring from this combination . phrases such as mad as a march hare , mad as a buck , mad as maybutter , and mad as a wet hen are older than mad as a hatter , leaving open the conclusion that hatter is but a variation of an existing term . ( interestingly , these other phrases pull in different directions , with mad as a march hare signifying odd or eccentric behavior , while mad as a wet hen characterizing anger .) <PARA> whatever the definitive origin of mad as a hatter , we know the term wasn ’ t coined by lewis carroll in his 1865 alice ’ s adventures in wonderland . the saying turns up in thackeray ’ s 1849 pendennis and thomas chandler haliburton ’ s 1837 the clockmaker . <PARA> carroll ’ s “ hatter ” might well have been modeled on theophilus carter , an eccentric furniture dealer who characteristically sported a top hat . carter was neither a hat maker nor had been exposed through his work to mercury fumes — if he had indeed been carroll ’ s inspiration for the “ mad hatter ” of alice , it would have been because he was a somewhat nutty real - life character much given to the wearing of highly noticeable hats . there also exists a possibility carroll was unaware of the mercury connection to the existing saying . it ’ s also possible he had not previously encountered the saying and thus thought he had coined it himself . <PARA> carroll ’ s alice is replete with word play . he loved to twist words , and encoding double and triple meanings into his work was for him part of the fun . his mad hatter could therefore be a caricature of theophilus carter , a real person of his acquaintance , while his mad as a hatter could have been a twist on the pre - existing saying , mad as a march hare . those familiar with alice will recall that the march hare was the constant companion of the mad hatter . <PARA> moreover , mad at that time had more than a few meanings : “ off the rocker ” and “ angry ,” but also “ venomous ,” which suggests yet another twist in the game . according to a dictionary of common fallacies : <PARA> lewis carroll with his penchant for linguistic games presumably knew perfectly well that his “ mad hatter ’ meant ‘ a venomous adder ’, but since his readers may have been misled by tenniel ’ s drawings , it should be pointed out that ‘ mad ’ meant ‘ venomous ’ and ‘ hatter ’ is a corruption of ‘ adder ’, or viper , so that the phrase ‘ mad as an atter ’ originally meant ‘ as venomous as a viper ’. <PARA> supporting the “ adder ” theory comes this entry from an 1882 phrase origin book : <PARA> in the anglo - saxon the word ‘ mad ’ was used as a synonym for violent , furious , angry , or venomous . in some parts of england and in the united states particularly , it is still used in this sense . atter was the anglo - saxon name for an adder , or viper . the proverbial saying has therefore probably no reference to hat - makers , but merely means ‘ as venomous as an adder .’ the germans call the viper natter . <PARA> as does this 1895 entry from beckwith ’ s almanac , which cites the brooklyn eagle as its source : <PARA> the phrase “ mad as a hatter ” has no reference to that respectable artist who designs the crowning article of civilized male attire , but relates back to the anglo - saxon word “ atter ” ( an adder or viper ). “ mad ” was formerly used as a synonym for violent or venomous and is still used in that sense in some parts of england as well as in this country . the phrase , therefore , strictly means as “ venomous as a viper ,” the old form , “ mad as an atter ,” having been corrupted to “ mad as a hatter .” <PARA> a sharp - eyed reader spotted this very early sighting of “ mad as an adder ” in an 1842 publication : <PARA> he was as mad as a striped adder . <PARA> whether carroll meant his “ hatter ” as a caricature of a known crackpot , a play on mad as a march hare , as a bit of tomfoolery about venomous vipers , or as a combination of all three , it seems clear that the only relation his use of the term had to mercury - maddened hat makers was that of coincidence . <PARA> barbara “ mercury rising ” mikkelson	
false	origins : the above - quoted september 2010 alert about a person named thierry mairot who is supposedly contacting children through their facebook social networking accounts to “ talk about sex ” appears to have originated with a french - language version : <PARA> attention avis aux parents dont les enfants on un profil facebook . un homme essaye de rentrer en contact avec eux pour parler de sexe il sappelle thierry mairot . partager ce message sur vos mur s . v . p <PARA> it has since been circulated in various english - language versions , such as the example cited above and the following : <PARA> to all parents whose children have a profile on facebook . there is a man trying to get in contact with children to talk about sex . his name is thierry mairot . please pass on this message . thanks . <PARA> <PARA> attention ... to all parents whose children have a profile on facebook . there is a man trying to get in contact with children to talk about sex . his name is thierry mairot . please copy and paste this onto your wall and warn all ur friends ! please everyone moms and dads ... repost and get him off of facebook ! parents , grandparents aunts , uncles and cousins ! even if you have no kids <PARA> attention ... to all parents whose children have a profile on facebook . there is a man trying to get in contact with children to talk about sex . his name is thierry mairot . please copy and paste this onto your wall and warn all ur friends ! please everyone moms and dads ... repost and get him off of facebook ! parents , grandparents aunts , uncles and cousins ! even if you have no kids <PARA> we haven ’ t found any information confirming that a person named thierry mairot is ( or was ) contacting children through facebook to engage them in sexual conversations , and had such activity been going on , given how long and how widely these warning messages have been circulating surely facebook would have long since been alerted to the situation . <PARA> this item appears similar in form to the long - running “ social deviants ” prank , in which the names of real persons are inserted into messages warning others against communicating with them via various social media .	
false	it sounds too easy to be true : forward an e - mail , rack up some cancer research money . and it is . too easy to be true , that is . <PARA> this “ dying child chain letter ” hoax now circulating on the net victimizes the american cancer society . in the name of a fictitious little girl , people are exhorted to forward the letter on because each forward drops more money into the research coffers . such an offer is hard to resist because it ’ s a painless good deed , a way to enjoy a self - congratulatory pat on the back for “ making a difference ” without actually having to do anything . after all , it ’ s being underwritten by the american cancer society and nameless corporate sponsors , right ? <PARA> uh , wrong . you see , there is no jessica mydek , and there is no such program to score up some easy cancer research money . what there is , however , is the long - suffering american cancer society who have been left holding the bag . <PARA> but let ’ s take a look at what ’ s actually being bounced around the net , eh ? <PARA> that was the original version . since january 1997 , this “ 3 cent ” e - mail hoax has undergone numerous major transformations : <PARA> by november 1997 the tamara martin e - mail had returned , this time with the ante upped to 6 cents per forward but copies still directed to < cool12 <USER> by january 1998 , copies of this new 6 cent e - mail were being directed to < christmas <USER> <PARA> the make - a - wish foundation helps the dreams of terminally ill children come true . by the time a child is brought to its attention , everything medically possible has already been done . it ’ s not a matter of collecting donations to pay for a child ’ s care ; it ’ s about making final days special days . <PARA> make - a - wish did not take kindly to being included in someone ’ s idea of a rousing good jest . they tracked down the person who ’ d started this particular version of the game . they also put up a web page denying that they had anything to do with this e - mail . <PARA> some of the numerous versions in circulation contain an exhortation from dr . dennis shields of the department of developmental and molecular biology at the albert einstein college of medicine of yeshiva university . like many others in the history of internet lore , his name mysteriously came to be attached to a hoax . as he said about it : <PARA> thank god the american cancer society doesn ’ t have an america online address , else by now they ’ d be swamped with copies of forwarded messages from well - meaning but terribly misguided people . ( as is becoming the norm for large organizations , the acs has its own domain name : www . cancer . org ). even so , the various acs offices around the country have been hit with calls asking about this most touching e - mail , and manpower that could be put to much better use ended up staffing phones and answering e - mail . ( it ’ s ironic , that . the families of real dying seven - year - olds end up getting the short end of the stick because of this outpouring of love for a fictitious child .) <PARA> the acs position is quite simple : they “ do not endorse the use of chain letters .” ever . they ’ ve also told me that this particular “ use of the society ’ s name is unauthorized .” also , they don ’ t know any jessica mydek . indeed , they ’ re doing their level best to investigate where this wild e - mail came from . it certainly wasn ’ t from them . ( check out what they have to say about it at the acs web site .) <PARA> above and beyond the information obtained from my conversations with the acs , common sense alone should show this up for the hoax it is . think about it for a second . one of the primary purposes of the american cancer society is the direction of funds to cancer research . ( the acs is good at this : since its inception in the 1950s , it has directed $ 1 . 7 billion to the cause .) the concept of the acs “ donating ” funds towards cancer research is akin to the notion of a hockey player “ donating ” all the goals he scores to his team . <PARA> then there is the matter of unnamed corporate sponsors ; there just ain ’ t any such critters . companies donate monies to worthy causes , and their reward for doing so is becoming identified in the public ’ s mind not only with that particular cause but also with the larger concepts of service to one ’ s community and a sense of social responsibility . these are powerful images to plant in the minds of consumers , far too powerful to just be thrown away by remaining anonymous . <PARA> it all adds up to hoax . even the child ’ s name provides a further clue : as has been pointed out by a few people , “ jessica mydek ” is nearly homophonous with a rudely - phrased request for oral sex ( think about it ), and the mentality that would create this chain letter would also get sniggering pleasure out of the thought of concealed dirty words being unknowingly e - mailed all over the globe by well - intentioned people . <PARA> likely as not the perpetrator of the original hoax had no idea of the havoc his creation could wreak . perhaps he gave in to the urge that prompts some of us to reach for the spray paint upon sighting a prominent and ever - so - grafittable rockface . urge for immortality and all that . not immortality for a dying seven - year - old , you understand — immortality for the prankster . <PARA> so please , if you get it , don ’ t forward it . you ’ re giving the wrong person immortality .	
mixture	origins : the photographs displayed above are genuine , although they ’ re often accompanied by text that places them in the wrong locale , and they don ’ t depict a site that hungry eagles just happened to stumble upon where they found friendly locals willing to feed them . <PARA> these pictures were taken in homer , alaska , at a designated eagle feeding area near the ( former ) residence of jean keene , commonly known as that state ’ s “ eagle lady .” as described by the los angeles times : <PARA> with her flaming red hair , bright red lipstick and large round glasses , keene was a fixture in homer , an alaska fishing and artists community 130 miles south of anchorage . <PARA> she started feeding the eagles in the late 1970s , when she was working at a fish - processing plant called icicle seafoods , located on the narrow spit of land that juts into the kachemak bay . every day she would chop hundreds of pounds of salmon heads and tails , as well as cod and herring , most of it spoiled or freezer - burned , and toss it to the predatory birds . <PARA> the eagles ’ wintertime arrival and the woman feeding them on the pebbly beach outside her tiny trailer attracted photographers to homer from throughout the country . as a washington post reporter put it in 2005 , “ if you have seen stunning close - up photographs of bald eagles with fish in their beaks in glossy magazines ... chances are good that they were shot outside keene ’ s trailer .” <PARA> she started feeding the eagles in the late 1970s , when she was working at a fish - processing plant called icicle seafoods , located on the narrow spit of land that juts into the kachemak bay . every day she would chop hundreds of pounds of salmon heads and tails , as well as cod and herring , most of it spoiled or freezer - burned , and toss it to the predatory birds . <PARA> the eagles ’ wintertime arrival and the woman feeding them on the pebbly beach outside her tiny trailer attracted photographers to homer from throughout the country . as a washington post reporter put it in 2005 , “ if you have seen stunning close - up photographs of bald eagles with fish in their beaks in glossy magazines ... chances are good that they were shot outside keene ’ s trailer .” <PARA> the anchorage daily news also noted : <PARA> the number of eagles drawn to the [ homer ] spit increased each year . keene ’ s biographer , cary anderson , said in 2003 that she was throwing out 500 pounds of food every day . curious onlookers would show up , too , parking like they were at a drive - in movie theater , telephoto lenses protruding from their windows . <PARA> “ jean never once sought publicity or attention for feeding the eagles ,” anderson said . “ she was generous to everyone who was interested in photographing the <PARA> eagles , whether she was interviewed or not . she never asked anyone for a dime .” <PARA> criticism of the eagle - feeding efforts flared up around homer in 2004 after photo guides and lodge owners began duplicating keene ’ s program , attracting eagles for the benefit of their clients . <PARA> critics said it was demeaning to turn the national bird into a dumpster diver . they said crowding eagles was unhealthy , threatened smaller birds and pets and drew eagles away from their natural wintering grounds . government biologists frowned on the practice but stopped short of calling for regulation . <PARA> supporters called such complaints unproven and noted the practice drew tourists to town in a quiet time of year . photographers lavished praise on the gritty keene . <PARA> “ homer was exactly the right place for jean keene , because she was a character ,” said ginkowski . “ you don ’ t see those originals much any more .” <PARA> “ jean never once sought publicity or attention for feeding the eagles ,” anderson said . “ she was generous to everyone who was interested in photographing the <PARA> eagles , whether she was interviewed or not . she never asked anyone for a dime .” <PARA> criticism of the eagle - feeding efforts flared up around homer in 2004 after photo guides and lodge owners began duplicating keene ’ s program , attracting eagles for the benefit of their clients . <PARA> critics said it was demeaning to turn the national bird into a dumpster diver . they said crowding eagles was unhealthy , threatened smaller birds and pets and drew eagles away from their natural wintering grounds . government biologists frowned on the practice but stopped short of calling for regulation . <PARA> supporters called such complaints unproven and noted the practice drew tourists to town in a quiet time of year . photographers lavished praise on the gritty keene . <PARA> “ homer was exactly the right place for jean keene , because she was a character ,” said ginkowski . “ you don ’ t see those originals much any more .” <PARA> ms . keene passed away in january 2009 at the age of 85 .	
false	below is a picture of a cfl light bulb from my bathroom . i turned it on the other day and then smelled smoke after a few minutes . four inch flames were spewing out of the side of the ballast like a blow torch ! i immediately turned off the lights . but i ’ m sure it would have caused a fire if i was not right there . imagine if the kids had left the lights on as usual when they were not in the room . <PARA> i took the bulb to the fire department today to report the incident . the fireman wasn ’ t at all surprised and said that it was not an uncommon occurrence . apparently , sometimes when the bulb burns out there is a chance that the ballast can start a fire . he told me that the fire marshall had issued reports about the dangers of these bulbs . <PARA> upon doing some internet research , it seems that bulbs made by “ globe ” in china seem to have the lion ’ s share of problems . lots of fires have been blamed on misuse of cfl bulbs , like using them in recessed lighting , pot lights , dimmers or in track lighting . mine was not in any of those . it was a normal light socket . <PARA> i bought these at wal - mart . i will be removing all the globe bulbs from my house . i have not decided yet if we are going back to incandescent bulbs at this point . <PARA> origins : we first spotted this warning about a fire hazard associated with cfl bulbs ( accompanied by a photo of a bulb made by globe electric , a firm which has its head office in montreal but which manufactures its light bulbs in china ) in april 2010 . in its original form , the heads - up being circulated said “ i bought these at canadian tire or wal - mart ,” a statement that places the item ’ s purchase point in canada , in that while globe does vend its cfl bulbs at wal - marts in canada , it does not do so at wal - marts in the u . s . later versions of the e - mail elided mention of the canadian hardware chain , thereby leading readers to assume the bulb had been purchased in the u . s . <PARA> cfls ( compact fluorescent lamps ) don ’ t burn out the way incandescent light bulbs do . instead , as they near the ends of their lives , they grow dimmer . while some cfl bulbs merely stop emitting light when they finally quit working , others kick the bucket with <PARA> a dramatic “ pop ”! sound and then vent a distinct odor . a few even release a bit of smoke at their termination . sometimes the bases of the bulbs turn black . this seemingly cataclysmic reaction has to do with the breakdown of the bulb ’ s ballast , which is contained in the part of the bulb that is screwed into the socket . as the bulb ages and degrades , so does its ballast . yet as scary as odors , smoke , and even blackening of the base of the bulb might be , these lamps are fireproof and are meant to fail safely at the end of their lives . <PARA> john drengenberg , consumer affairs manager at underwriters laboratories ( ul ), said about how cfls expire : “ people expect to see the bright flash and to hear the popping like a traditional incandescent bulb , but the burn out of a cfl is different . the light dims over time and might produce a more dramatic pop , emit a distinct odor , and maybe even release some smoke .” <PARA> national geographic ’ s green guide says of cfls : “ bulbs burn out when the ballast overheats and an electronic component , the voltage dependent resistor ( vdr ), opens up like a fuse in your home ’ s fuse box , shutting off the circuit and generating heat and possibly a small amount of smoke . this might sound dangerous , but the vdr is a cut - off switch that prevents any hazards . the melted plastic you ’ re seeing where the glass coil connects to the ballast is simply a sign that the heat is escaping as intended in the design of the bulb .” <PARA> in a nutshell , healthy cfl bulbs may emit a bit of smoke and smell and have burnt - looking bases when they die , but that ’ s as it should be — there ’ s no fire danger to any of that , and indeed the bulbs are functioning properly when they act that way . <PARA> however , flames shooting out the side of a bulb is not the way things should be . it needs be kept in mind that any electrical device can malfunction , either through manufacturing defects or as a result of misuse by consumers . says globe of the bulb in the photo , “ as for this particular incident , the mention of flames / fire in the story is certainly outside of the norm and as such we would encourage the consumer to bring the bulb to their local fire marshal and / or safety authority to further investigate .” <PARA> there have so far been no reported or confirmed cases of fire involving globe - branded cfls . in october 2010 , however , the u . s . consumer product safety commission announced a recall of the chinese - manufactured trisonic brand of cfl bulbs due to “ four reports of incidents , including two fires that resulted in minor property damage .”	
false	origins : this heads - up about a major earthquake poised to devastate the los angeles area on 30 september 2010 began life two days prior to that date as a post on quake prediction , a web site that is not associated with the united states geological <PARA> survey ( usgs ), one of the recognized touchstones for all things related to earthquakes . it was picked up by posters on twitter , who spread it more widely . <PARA> the september 2010 offering was similar to the earthquake prediction hoax of april 2010 in which caltech was said to have sent its employees home in anticipation of a large earthquake due to strike los angeles . another earthquake prediction scare that enthralled the internet in 2009 posited that an eclipse would trigger a tsunami which in turn would cause a massive earthquake on july 22 of that year . <PARA> as always with such claims , the bottom line is that earthquakes can ’ t yet be predicted with anything close to this level of certainty . the southern california earthquake center says of the notion that scientists have come up with a mechanism for determining when and where an earthquake will occur that “ scientists cannot yet make precise predictions of their date , time , and place .” so also says the u . s . geological survey : “ neither the usgs nor caltech nor any other scientists have ever predicted a major earthquake . they do not know how , and they do not expect to know how any time in the foreseeable future .” <PARA> barbara “ unpredictable ” mikkelson

sarkozy ( the former model who is the wife of french president nicolas sarkozy ) in strasbourg prior to a nato summit in april 2009 , the uk ’ s guardian newspaper termed the occasion a “ fashion face -

false	the pop music concert industry has come a long way since the mid - 1960s , when groups like the beatles would undertake tours during which they played for less than half an hour , performing the same rigid set list of a dozen recent songs at each stop . now concert tours are much more elaborately staged productions , with established artists sometimes playing for upwards of two or three hours and performing music drawn from the breadth of recording careers that have spanned multiple decades . and although some artists stick with relatively unvarying set lists throughout their tours , others have taken a variety of approaches towards mixing things up : shuffling different songs in and out of their list every few shows , offering a completely different set list at every stop , or resorting to gimmicks such as playing only audience requests , inviting fans to vote on what music they should perform , or even selecting songs completely at random . <PARA> a legend which plays on the subject of set lists holds that during one of their shows in the 1970s , aerosmith , for reasons unknown ( one assumes the influence of recreational substances ), decided to shake things up by playing their set in reverse , beginning with the encore and ending with the opening number . however , after getting on stage and running through the first song ( i . e ., the encore ), the group , for reasons unknown ( one assumes the influence of recreational substances ), thought their set was over and walked off stage after having performed only a single tune : <PARA> as amusing ( and perhaps believable , among some quarters ) as this tale might be , according to aerosmith lead guitarist joe perry there ’ s nothing to it : <PARA> however , an anecdote attributed to tim collins , who managed aerosmith from 1984 - 1996 , held that the band ’ s lead singer , steven tyler , once failed to recognize one of the group ’ s older songs when it was played back to him :	
true	origins : a venerable urban legend tells the tale of an imbiber who drives home after an alcohol - fueled night on the town , then discovers the body of a child embedded in the grille of his car the following morning . the video clip displayed above takes that scenario a step further , showing a truck driver seemingly cruising along a highway while unknowingly pushing an automobile — with its driver still inside — which had become trapped sideways in front of his tanker . <PARA> the incident shown is apparently real enough that both police and the trucking company investigated it at the time it occurred in january 2010 and again when the short video of the event displayed above hit the internet in march 2010 , although some of the details are still murky . according to various news reports : <PARA> west yorkshire police investigated the incident but took no further action against the driver of the truck following advice from the crown prosecution service . in may 2010 , the north west traffic commissioner ruled the driver could keep his license , praising the man ’ s coolness and “ clear head ” on discovering the clio attached to his lorry .	
false	even as you read this , the world famous nigerian scam ( also known as a “ 4 - 1 - 9 ” or “ advance fee fraud ” scheme ) is parting yet more of the ‘ something for nothing ’ crowd from their money . <PARA> here ’ s how it works : letters ( or , nowadays , e - mail messages ) postmarked from nigeria ( or sierra leone , or the ivory coast , or almost any other foreign nation ) are sent to addresses taken from large mailing lists . the letters promise rich rewards for helping officials of that government ( or bank , or quasi - government agency or sometimes just members of a particular family ) out of an embarrassment or a legal problem . typically , the pitch includes mention of multi - million dollar sums , with the open promise that you will be permitted to keep a startling percentage of the funds you ’ re going to aid in squirreling away for these disadvantaged foreigners . <PARA> if you ’ re not saying “ scam ” by now , you should be . should you agree to participate in this international bail - out , something will go wrong . paperwork will be delayed . questions will be asked . officials will need to be bribed . money from you — an insignificant sum , really , in light of the windfall about to land in your lap — will be required to get things back on track . you pay , you wait for the transfer ... and all you ’ ll get in return are more excuses about why the funds are being held up and assurances that everything can be straightened out if you ’ ll just send a bit more cash to help the process along . once your bank account has been sucked dry or you start making threats , you ’ ll never hear from these nigerians again . as for the money you ’ ve thrown at this , it ’ s gone forever . <PARA> in a nutshell , the con works by blinding the victim with promises of an unimaginable fortune . once the sucker is sufficiently glittery - eyed over the prospect of becoming fabulously rich , he is squeezed for however much money he has . this he parts with willingly , thinking “ what ’ s $ 5 , 000 here or $ 10 , 000 there when i ’ m going to end up with $ 2 million when this is all done ?” he fails to realize during the sting that he ’ s never going to get the promised fortune ; all of this messing around is designed to part him from his money . <PARA> in another form taken by the nigerian scam , a church or religious organization is contacted by a wealthy foreigner who says he desires nothing more than to leave his considerable fortune to that particular group . maybe he says he ’ s led a life of sin and is now trying to make good , or maybe he claims that as a devout christian he heard about their good works and wants to leave his money to help continue them , but whatever the backstory , it ’ s just a tale . once again , there will be delays , each of them necessitating the “ beneficiary ” to spend a few thousand here and a few thousand there in an effort to collect money that never materializes . <PARA> in a 2002 version of the con , the victim is informed he has just won an important prize in a foreign lottery he doesn ’ t remember entering . only when he tries to collect the money is he approached for payment of facilitation fees to get his winnings to him . it ’ s the same con , with just a few elements unimportant to the execution of the thievery changed about . <PARA> the scam is known as the nigerian scam , but many countries are routinely named as the homelands the appeals originate from . likewise , the backstory , the tale that supposedly explains how these people came into possession of this incredible sum and why they now need help getting it out of wherever , changes from one e - mail to the next . there are hundreds of versions in existence , each naming different people , describing different situations , and coming from a myriad of far - flung countries . forget about matching one backstory to another or being suspicious of e - mails from nigerians but not applying the same caution to approaches from folks from other places — grasp instead the general principle of the scam : someone from someplace far away wants to give you ( or your church ) millions of dollars but needs your help in moving the money from there to here . it doesn ’ t matter if the letter says it came from sri lanka and the “ funds ” that need moving are gold bricks or uncut diamonds — it ’ s the nigerian scam . don ’ t let the naming blind you to that . <PARA> once the scam is explained , it seems so obvious a con that you ’ d wonder who would fall for it . yet fall for it people do because they ’ re mesmerized by the wealth that will soon be theirs . they also fail to realize there ’ s a hook hanging just out of sight ; at first all they see is that someone wants to give them something , thus they ’ re ill - prepared to mentally shift gears when that person turns the tables . because the premise of “ i ’ m going to get millions of dollars ” is wholeheartedly swallowed early on , it ’ s not at a later point questioned when things begin to go wrong with the transaction and the dupes who have been targeted are asked to dig up some funds to help move things along . <PARA> the nigerian scam is hugely successful . according to a 1997 newspaper article : <PARA> but this is a new scam , right ? people are falling for it because they ’ ve yet to catch on ? <PARA> wrong . very , very wrong . <PARA> the nigerian scam has been emptying the pockets of victims for decades — first through letters , then with faxes , and now via e - mail . in its earliest incarnation , which dates to at least the 1920s , it was known as ‘ the spanish prisoner ’ con . in that long - ago version , businessmen were contacted by someone trying to smuggle the scion of a wealthy family out of a prison in spain . but of course the wealthy family would shower with riches those who helped secure the release of the boy . those who were suckered into this paid for one failed rescue attempt after another , with the fictitious prisoner continuing to languish in his non - existent dungeon , always just one more bribe , one more scheme , one more try , away from being released . <PARA> these days it ’ s trapped funds not errant sons of well - to - do families that are the objects of these global wild goose chases , but the con is the same . the undisputed headquarters of the scam is nigeria , with some of the cons progressing so far as to have the victims fly to that country to meet with the “ officials ” they are purportedly assisting . things got so out of hand , in fact , that in 1991 the nigerian government felt compelled to issue a statement disavowing its participation in this scheme : <PARA> ah , but is it the same scheme ? you tell me : <PARA> the real central bank of nigeria tries to warn people about this scam , but it ’ s a case of the guy with the broom following the elephant — the elephant always gets there first . they even placed a half - page ad explaining the scam and warning off those who might be tempted to fall for it in major u . s . newspapers , such as the 27 october 1998 issue of the los angeles times . that ad mentioned some new variations on the old scheme : <PARA> should you have occasion to feel something ’ s not quite right about a deal being offered , drop by the websites of both the better business bureau ( bbb ) and the national fraud information center ( nfic ). <PARA> salon . com editor douglas cruickshank also penned “ i crave your distinguished indulgence ( and all your cash ),” a wonderful textual analysis of nigerian fraud messages . <PARA> the secret service asks if you have been victimized by the nigerian scam to forward appropriate written documentation to the united states secret service , financial crimes division , 950 h street , nw , washington , d . c . 20223 , or telephone ( 202 ) 406 - 5850 , or contact by e - mail . per their automated response system , they no longer want faxed copies of the various nigerian scams . <PARA> however , it needs to be pointed out there is only so much the secret service or any law enforcement agency can do if the perpetrators of the scam are not within their jurisdiction . your local police department cannot send officers to nigeria to arrest the fellows who are attempting to con you out of your life savings any more than nigerian police could show up on your doorstep to put the handcuffs on you . <PARA> folks angered by nigerian scam come - ons often want to see justice done and done quickly , yet often there is little that can be done because those behind the thefts are in other parts of the world . ergo , the best protection is an awareness that the laws of your country are not always enforceable in other lands , so it behooves you to always proceed with caution when dealing with people or business entities in foreign locales . <PARA> advisory regarding “ advance fee fraud ” schemes ( u . s . secret service ) <PARA> the “ nigerian ” scam : costly compassion ( federal trade commission ) <PARA> consumers now target of nigerian scam letters ( better business bureau ) <PARA> nigerian letter scams go hi - tech ( better business bureau )	
mixture	precious few who are under the weather skip happily into hospitals , a song on their lips , and not a care in the world . typical inpatients worry about many things : the condition that ’ s caused them to be hospitalized , being away from their homes and families , and even the quality of medical care they will receive while hospitalized . <PARA> the piece quoted above ( which we began seeing circulated in e - mail in june 2010 ) speaks to that last concern . its text was harvested from a 4 march 2010 wall street journal ‘ s smartmoney magazine article titled “ 10 things your hospital won ’ t tell you ,” where its topic of july mortality rates in hospitals appeared as item nine . <PARA> that seemingly helpful heads - up is a summary of information pulled from another source , with some key aspects left out . the “ 10 things ” item drew its information from a 2005 national bureau of economic research article titled “ cohort turnover and productivity : the july phenomenon in teaching hospitals .” that paper examined what is termed “ the july phenomenon ,” “ the july effect ,” or “ the new resident hypothesis ”: a reduction in quality of service related to the annual turnover of house staff in teaching hospitals . using patient - level data gathered from roughly 700 hospitals per year over the period from 1993 to 2001 , it concluded that there is a measurable increase in both length of patient stay and rates of patient mortality during the july - august transition , when experienced residents and interns are replaced by new ones . <PARA> key to the understanding that paper , however , is noting that its conclusions apply solely to teaching hospitals , institutions where residents and interns treat patients as part of their medical training . it ’ s therefore not true that all hospitals become a bit more dangerous in july . it ’ s also not true that all teaching hospitals experience this decline . as the paper noted , “ in fact , the most - intensive teaching hospitals manage to avoid significant effects on mortality following this turnover ” thanks to better supervision of new doctors . <PARA> however , at teaching institutions where oversight of new staff is less stringent , the “ july effect ” is real . moreover , it lasts not merely throughout that month but for the rest of the calendar year as well . while risk - adjusted mortality rates may rise by roughly 4 percent in the july - august period , that increase remains at between 2 and 4 percent until the new year , resulting in 8 to 14 additional deaths per annum at a typical teaching hospital . <PARA> the increase in patient deaths does not , as many people assume , have to do mostly with untrained surgeons running amok ; it is instead largely attributable to fatal medication errors , according to a may 2010 study published in the journal of general internal medicine . in that study , researchers from the university of california , san diego examined computerized death certificates from 1979 - 2006 , focusing on the certificates of inpatients , outpatients , and those who died in the emergency department , in which medication error was recorded as the primary cause of death . ( computerized death certificates do not record whether the patient died in a teaching hospital , but they do record the county of death , so researchers looked at the proportion of major teaching hospitals in each county .) counties containing teaching hospitals experienced a 10 % rise in fatal medication errors in july , whereas counties lacking teaching hospitals did not experience that spike . the lethal mistakes included dispensing the wrong drugs , overdoses , and accidents involving drugs or biological agents . <PARA> in a bit that didn ’ t come from any of the studies discussed above , the e - mailed item asserts : <PARA> surgeons aren ’ t necessarily at their best first thing in the morning : like other mere mortals , some are bright - eyed and bushy - tailed as soon as their eyes snap open but fade as the day goes on , others hit their strides no earlier than the afternoon , and others are everywhere in between . similarly , the day of the week doesn ’ t appear to affect the skill level of surgeons . <PARA> according to an october 2009 article in the journal anesthesiology ( produced by the american society of anesthesiologists ), there is no bad time of the day , week , or year to have elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery , thus one needn ’ t worry about being a thursday or friday operation . it had been postulated the crazy hours surgeons work would impart fatigue - related disadvantages to patients who underwent operations later in the week , yet that did not prove to be the case : results from surgeries performed early and late in the week and at different times of the day were all similar . the reason why coronary artery bypass grafting was studied was because that procedure is the most common heart surgery , and there are well - established protocols for it . the analysis was limited to elective operations because emergency procedures are inherently riskier and are often performed on patients that have additional medical problems . <PARA> yet being the first under the knife on any given day may confer certain advantages to the patient . being early on the day ’ s roster means one ’ s surgery will start on time , whereas patients booked later in the day may find their procedures pushed back as complications in the operating room work to make a mess of the day ’ s schedule . also , the operating room is at its cleanest prior to the first operation , a factor for those concerned about the risk of post - operative infection .

( which is why the joke of the moment when they first appeared in 1996 was to dub them “ the queen with the bear behind .”) <PARA> the april 2010 counterfeit rumor asserted that the telling clue regarding the genuineness of any suspect toonie was to be found in the engraving of the queen borne on their obverse sides . said the wisdom of the moment , the fakes sported a larger than usual portrait of her , plus she appeared in it lacking a crown . one was advised by this rumor to dump these coins because they were worthless . <PARA> whether this alert was meant in good fun or was sincere , the coins it pointed to as fakes were in fact the real thing . according to the royal canadian mint ( the crown corporation responsible for the minting and distribution of canada ’ s circulation coins ), since 2003 all toonies have been struck with a new uncrowned effigy of the queen that is larger than the crowned one that appeared on toonies made from 1996 to 2002 . <PARA> the royal canadian mint issued this statement about the rumor : <PARA> since 1996 , canadian two - dollar circulation coins have been produced with two different images of the queen : a smaller crowned portrait ( from 1996 to 2002 ) and a larger uncrowned portrait introduced in 2003 to update the image of her majesty on all canadian coinage . <PARA> this last effigy has appeared on all canadian circulation coins ( one - cent , five - cent , 10 - cent , 25 - cent , 50 - cent , one - dollar and two - dollar denominations ) produced since june 2003 . <PARA> all circulation coins bearing these effigies are genuine and are to be accepted as legal tender in canada . <PARA> if , for any other reason , there is suspicion of a non - genuine coin , canadians are encouraged to contact their local law enforcement authorities . <PARA> this last effigy has appeared on all canadian circulation coins ( one - cent , five - cent , 10 - cent , 25 - cent , 50 - cent , one - dollar and two - dollar denominations ) produced since june 2003 . <PARA> all circulation coins bearing these effigies are genuine and are to be accepted as legal tender in canada . <PARA> if , for any other reason , there is suspicion of a non - genuine coin , canadians are encouraged to contact their local law enforcement authorities . <PARA> as the queen has aged , the engravings of her image used on coins and paper money have been updated , both in canada and in the united kingdom . interestingly , a similar rumor spread in the uk regarding its £ 2 coins following their issue in june 1998 , because on some of these [ then ] new coins , the queen appeared wearing a necklace , but on others she didn ’ t . both versions of £ 2 coins were valid , just some had been minted using the raphael maklouf portrait of her common to all uk circulating coins between 1985 and 1997 , whereas others bore the 1998 ian rank - broadley portrait . <PARA> in addition to the “ watch out for these fake coins !” tale , the uk £ 2 coins attracted a rumor that the ones bearing an engraving of the queen in which she was wearing a necklace were especially valuable and that collectors of rare coins would pay dearly for them . alas , that was but wishful thinking — as the royal mint says of that rumor , “ since millions of the 1997 £ 2 coins were issued , there is no reason to believe that these coins are particularly rare .” <PARA> barbara “ the origin of the specie ” mikkelson

false	several similar items have been circulated during or since the 2008 u . s . presidential election , all suggesting ( without evidence ) that barack and michelle obama , both of whom obtained licenses to practice law in illinois , were forced to give up those licenses in order to avoid having them revoked through disciplinary actions or criminal prosecution . in fact , neither of the obamas gave up their law licenses because they were facing disciplinary actions or criminal charges : <PARA> such claims are false ones , based on misreadings of information about license status and erroneous interpretations and assumptions about such information , as detailed below : <PARA> this lead - in was wrong on two counts : michelle obama does in fact have a license to practice law in illinois ( it is currently on inactive status ), and she did not hold a position as legal counsel with the university of chicago hospitals ( rather , she worked at that institution as executive director for community affairs and then vice president for community and external affairs ). none of her job duties at the university of chicago hospitals required her to have an active law license . <PARA> this passage was also wrong : michelle obama did not “ voluntarily surrender ” her law license ; she requested that her license be placed on “ inactive ” status . the difference is crucial : a lawyer who has surrendered his law license has given it up and therefore no longer has a license , while a lawyer who has gone on inactive status still holds a valid law license but is not currently engaged in any professional activities that require it to be active . <PARA> a lawyer ’ s holding active license status can entail a number of obligations , both financial and otherwise : paying bar association fees , carrying malpractice insurance , taking continuing legal education classes , etc . therefore , it is not uncommon for lawyers who are not in practice ( i . e ., do not appear in court or counsel clients ) and do not expect to return to practice in the near future to request that their licenses be placed on inactive status in order to avoid these ongoing obligations . <PARA> reactivating an inactive law license is a fairly easy procedure , as noted in the volokh group blog for law professors : <PARA> the following passage included the erroneous implication that barack obama also gave up his law license to avoid disciplinary action : <PARA> this passage was similarly incorrect : barack obama did not “ surrender ” his law license . like his wife , barack obama had no need for an active law license for the work in which he was engaged , so in february 2007 ( after announcing his candidacy for the presidency ) he chose to have his law license placed on “ voluntarily inactive ” status , and after becoming president he opted to change his status to “ voluntarily retired .” neither of the obamas was irrevocably stripped of a law license through the action of “ surrendering ” it . <PARA> james grogan , deputy administrator and chief counsel for the attorney registration and disciplinary commission of the supreme court of illinois , affirmed that the obamas were “ never the subject of any public disciplinary proceedings ,” and the illinois state bar association continues to list barack and michelle obama as honorary members of that organization . <PARA> the above passage was also not true . information about the statuses of both barack and michelle obama ’ s licenses is readily retrievable , both show no record of any disciplinary actions or pending proceedings , and the elapsed time for searches we performed on their information was comparable to that for searches on information about other names in the illinois ardc database . <PARA> ( the “ malpractice insurance ” section of michelle obama ’ s license information which included a notation about her being on “ court ordered inactive status ” was not , as commonly misinterpreted , an indication of any wrongdoing on her part . that terminology was used simply because prior to the end of 1999 , the illinois ardc rules required “ a proceeding in the court for any voluntary transfer to inactive status , whether because of some incapacitating condition or solely as a matter of the lawyer ’ s preference because the lawyer would not be practicing law .”) <PARA> this was hardly remarkable or suspicious : neither of the obamas held a currently active law license because neither president of the united states nor first lady was a position that required one . this statement was also inaccurate in referring to the obamas as the “ first lawyer president and first lady ,” as both bill and hillary clinton held law degrees and engaged in legal work prior to the former ’ s election to the presidency .	
false	a breathless warning about endangered christian missionaries and churches in india has been circulating on the internet since late february 2010 : <PARA> those of the faithful concerned for their overseas brethren should breathe a bit more easily : this particular tale is a hoax . it ’ s several years old now , and even at the time it was current there were no reports out of india of buddhist extremists on the rampage with twenty christian churches left burning in their wake . christians living in india who were asked about this rumor were non - plussed , as they certainly hadn ’ t taken to hiding in small villages out of fear of marauding buddhists . <PARA> rev . samuel stephens of the india gospel league ( igl ) attested that this message was false , writing that : <PARA> as for the rest of this tale , as far as we can tell no place on earth ( let alone just india ) is named olisabang , as a city , province , territory , or anything else . also , the republic of india is composed of 28 states and 7 union territories — it doesn ’ t have provinces . <PARA> buddhist extremist groups are prevalent in sri lanka , but not india . there are few buddhists in india , almost too few to count , which should immediately make any tale about buddhists on the warpath in india suspect . approximately 80 . 5 % of india ’ s population is hindu , 13 . 4 % muslim , 2 . 3 % christian , and 1 . 9 % sikh . <PARA> violent attacks on christians occurred in india around the time of this warning , but they were carried out by hindu extremists in 2008 in the indian state of orissa . many christian families in that area were forced to abandon their faith in exchange for their safety . churches and houses were burned , and at least thirty christians lost their lives . the 2008 wave of violence was touched off by the killing of a charismatic hindu preacher known as swami laxmanananda saraswati . although police blamed maoist guerrillas for the swami ’ s killing , hindu radicals held christians responsible for his death .

false	what could possibly be behind a story like this ? <PARA> origins : the rumor of a ban on recreational fishing in the u . s . took flight after the publication of a 10 march 2010 editorial on the espn web site which suggested that the obama administration ’ s decision to end the public input phase for zoning issues under consideration by the interagency ocean policy task force “ could prohibit u . s . citizens from fishing some of the nation ’ s oceans , coastal areas , great lakes , and even inland waters .” <PARA> the interagency ocean policy task force was created to develop “ a recommendation for a national policy that ensures protection , maintenance , and restoration of oceans , our coasts and the great lakes . it will also recommend a framework for <PARA> improved stewardship , and effective coastal and marine spatial planning .” the task force has been considering subjects such as how commercial and recreational fishing impacts the environment in the waters within and around the u . s . and how to develop policies that balance fishing industry needs with prudent stewardship of those waters and the aquatic life they harbor . issues such as industrial over - harvesting or other fishing practices ( both commercial and recreational ) that threaten or endanger particular species of fish are matters for consideration by the task force . <PARA> the christian science monitor noted , for example , that : <PARA> the obama administration has proposed using united nations - guided principles to expand a type of zoning to coastal and even some inland waters . that ’ s raising concerns among fishermen that their favorite fishing holes may soon be off - limits for bait - casting . in the battle of incremental change that epitomizes the american conservation movement , many weekend anglers fear that the obama administration ’ s promise to “ fundamentally change ” water management in the us will erode what they call the public ’ s “ right to fish ,” in turn creating economic losses for the $ 82 billion recreational fishing industry and a further deterioration of the american outdoorsman ’ s legacy . proponents say the interagency ocean policy task force established by president obama last june will ultimately benefit the fishing public by managing ecosystems in their entirety rather than by individual uses such as fishing , shipping , or oil exploration . “ it ’ s not an environmentalist manifesto ,” says larry crowder , a marine biologist at duke university in north carolina . “ it ’ s multiple - use planning for the environment , and making sure various uses ... are sustainable .” <PARA> mr . obama has said he will not override protections put in place by presidents clinton and bush that established recreational fishermen as a special class . <PARA> mr . obama has said he will not override protections put in place by presidents clinton and bush that established recreational fishermen as a special class . <PARA> it ’ s not possible to predict at this point exactly what the policies the interagency ocean policy task force will recommend , but those recommendations will almost certainly be aimed primarily at the commercial fishing industry rather than recreational fishermen ; and although the task force might conceivably recommend some restrictions that would affect recreational fishing of particular species and / or in particular waters , the notion that recreational fishing in the u . s . is set to be banned entirely is an exceedingly far - fetched one . the task force ’ s interim report of september 2009 contained nothing that could reasonably be interpreted as suggesting such a ban was in the offing . <PARA> espn subsequently issued an editor ’ s update to the editorial that originally touched off the “ fishing ban ” brouhaha : <PARA> espnoutdoors . com inadvertently contributed to a flare - up when we posted the latest article in a series of stories on president barack obama ’ s newly created ocean policy task force , a column written by robert montgomery , a conservation writer for bass since 1985 . regrettably , we made several errors in the editing and presentation of this installment . though our series has included numerous news stories on the topic , this was not one of them — it was an opinion piece , and should have been clearly labeled as commentary . <PARA> and while our series overall has examined several sides of the topic , this particular column was not properly balanced and failed to represent contrary points of view . we have reached out to people on every side of the issue and reported their points of view — if they chose to respond — throughout the series , but failed to do so in this specific column . <PARA> and while our series overall has examined several sides of the topic , this particular column was not properly balanced and failed to represent contrary points of view . we have reached out to people on every side of the issue and reported their points of view — if they chose to respond — throughout the series , but failed to do so in this specific column .	
false	origins : human beings have long engaged in the practice of manipulating the breeding of plant species ( through techniques ranging from simple cross - pollination to complex gene splicing ) for a number of reasons , including improving the quality and <PARA> yield of crops , creating plants that can better withstand extreme environmental conditions , and developing food sources that are more resistant to the onslaught of <PARA> damaging insects , viruses , fungi and bacteria . <PARA> sometimes such breeding is undertaken purely for aesthetic reasons : to produce , for example , flowers that are “ prettier ” in some way , such as the brilliantly colored roses shown in the picture above . however , although the photograph itself has not been doctored , the roses have — but not through being “ bred ” to produce differently colored petals , as stated in the accompanying text . <PARA> these “ rainbow roses ” were created by dutch flower company owner peter van de werken , who produced them by developing a technique for injecting natural pigments into their stems while they are growing to create the striking multi - colored petal effect : <PARA> the dyes are produced from natural plant extracts and are absorbed by the flowers as they grow . <PARA> a special process then controls how much colour reaches each petal — with spectacular results . by treating the stalk with natural pigments , van de werken has managed to make each petal a different colour . the pigment is absorbed and travels to the petals where it changes their hue . <PARA> mr van de werken , 36 , said : “ we used to only sell single colour flowers but the market for them took a dip . myself and my colleagues started looking for something a bit different and came up with the idea of having different - coloured flowers . first of all we tried spraying the flowers but that did not work . then we tried the dye . it took us about six months to get it right and we still make mistakes .” <PARA> a special process then controls how much colour reaches each petal — with spectacular results . by treating the stalk with natural pigments , van de werken has managed to make each petal a different colour . the pigment is absorbed and travels to the petals where it changes their hue . <PARA> mr van de werken , 36 , said : “ we used to only sell single colour flowers but the market for them took a dip . myself and my colleagues started looking for something a bit different and came up with the idea of having different - coloured flowers . first of all we tried spraying the flowers but that did not work . then we tried the dye . it took us about six months to get it right and we still make mistakes .” <PARA> the process of creating and distributing rainbow roses is discussed in the following reuters news video : <PARA> additional photographs of rainbow roses can be viewed here .

false	as much as we shampoo it , style it , cut it , and fret over it , hair continues to be a mystery to us . we speculate on its nature , especially its propensity for sprouting in our middle years in places we didn ’ t want it to , even as it disappears from locations where we would much rather it had stayed put . we wonder if it continues to grow after we die . ( it doesn ’ t .) and we worry that shaving or cutting it will make hair grow back thicker or darker or coarser . <PARA> shavers and clippers take heart : in your quest for tonsorial perfection , you are not creating a larger problem for yourself through your efforts . cutting does not stimulate new growth . ( if it did , those going bald would be shaving afflicted areas to encourage regrowth of what they ’ re losing .) this belief probably stems from the perception that short hair seems to be tougher than longer hair . hair expert philip kingsley recommends thinking of a bamboo cane : a long cane flexes easily , but the same cane cut short feels harder and tougher . another reason for the belief resides with the naturally finer ends of uncut hair : compare the end of a long - lived hair with that of a hair recently cut or shaved , and you ’ ll see the one is thicker than the other . that could lead the less - than - careful to conclude that the whole of the hair ’ s shaft became thicker as a result of the hair ’ s being cut ( which it didn ’ t ) rather than to realize that shaving or cutting results in a blunt termination , whereas natural outgrowth concludes in a tapering . <PARA> the part of the hair we style is already dead . the living sections lie below the surface of the scalp . cutting or shaving the extreme end of the dead section isn ’ t going to have an impact on the parts that are alive . go forth to shave and trim as much as you like — you will not be affecting the intrinsic nature of your hair . <PARA> other mistaken hair beliefs include : <PARA> for most , the greying process is a gradual progression which takes place across a span of years , but for some it can occur at an accelerated rate or at a very early age . hair loss conditions such as alopecia areata can also cause all of the still - pigmented hairs on a head to fall out , leaving only the grey hairs ( which are more resistant ), resulting in a dramatic and seemingly “ overnight ” change . yet , when a person whose hair would have gone grey quickly anyway is subjected to horrible news , this coincidence is seized upon as evidence that the horrible news caused the early greyness . ( former first lady barbara bush is often pointed to as an example of the “ grey overnight from shock ” group . in 1953 , when she was 28 , her 3 - year - old daughter , robin , died of leukemia . during the months - long battle to save the child , mrs . bush ’ s hair became white .)	
true	theodore roosevelt was about to finish his first two - year term as governor of the state of new york when the republican party chose him as its candidate for vice president in the 1900 national election . the republicans were victorious at the ballot box that year , but roosevelt held the vice - presidency for less than a year before he was elevated to the white house upon the assassination of president william mckinley on 14 september 1901 , thereby becoming the youngest person ever to hold the office of president of the united states . roosevelt was elected to a full term as president in 1904 , and among his many notable achievements was his selection as a nobel peace prize laureate for his part in the negotiations leading to the treaty of portsmouth that ended the russo - japanese war in 1905 . <PARA> although roosevelt did not hold public office again after leaving the presidency in 1909 ( his efforts to regain the white house as a third party candidate in 1912 proving unsuccessful ), he remained active in the public political sphere . in the waning years of his life , as world war i raged in europe and america entered the conflict on the side of the allies , he frequently spoke of his belief that immigrants taking up residence in the u . s . should assimilate into american society as quickly as possible , learn the english language , eschew hyphenated national identities ( e . g ., “ italian - american ”) and declare their primary national allegiance to the united states of america . <PARA> on 1 february 1916 , for example , roosevelt advocated measures for strengthening and ensuring the “ loyalty ” of american immigrants : <PARA> a few months later , roosevelt expanded on this theme in a series of memorial day speeches he delivered in st . louis : <PARA> in a fourth of july speech in 1917 , roosevelt urged the adoption of linguistic uniformity , including a requirement that all foreign - language newspapers published in the u . s . should also include english translations : <PARA> likewise , on 27 may 1918 , roosevelt urged in a speech at des moines , iowa , that english be the sole language of instruction used in american schools : <PARA> the comments quoted at this head of the page are more in the same vein ; excerpts not from ( as claimed in the accompanying text ) a statement made by theodore roosevelt in 1907 ( while he was still president ), but from a letter written shortly before his death in january 1919 , just a few months after the armistice that ended the fighting in world war i : <PARA> a copy of this letter , obtained from the manuscript division of the library of congress , can be viewed here .	
true	though the story circulated in email identifies the dying child as “ billy ” instead of by his actual name , this internet tale is a relatively truthful , if overwritten , account . it ’ s also ( with the exception of the child ’ s name ) lifted word - for - word from the original chicken soup for the soul book . <PARA> not that we ’ re going to swear that all chicken soup stories are necessarily true , but this one is . in 1981 , frank “ bopsy ” salazar , a 7 - year - old dying of leukemia , became the first “ wish child ” helped by the make - a - wish foundation . this boy from phoenix had three wishes : to be a fireman , to ride in a hot air balloon , and to go to disneyland . he ultimately achieved all three ; the fulfillment of his first wish , the fireman one , was described by the make - a - wish foundation in their account of events : <PARA> bopsy went on to experience his hot - air balloon ride and a trip to disneyland . while in anaheim , he was treated with every courtesy a visiting fireman could wish for from his southern california colleagues , including being chauffeured to and from the los angeles airport in a fire truck and escorted around the park by two of his fellow firefighters from the anaheim fire department . <PARA> as for the more fantastic claim made in the e - mail — that phoenix fireman climbed through the child ’ s hospital window on the night bopsy died — this too holds true . it was only five firemen instead of the sixteen of the chicken soup version , but they did indeed park the hook and ladder below his window , then climb up the ladder and into his room :	
false	a significant subset of the e - mail forwards we receive consists of expressions of the theme that blacks are being overlooked and slighted by white americans , particularly in the economic arena . a common feature of such messages are claims that major companies decline to advertise in media that reach primarily black audiences ( because those businesses fail to recognize both the social desires and income levels of black americans ) and that the roles of blacks in american history have been ignored or minimized . <PARA> examples : <PARA> this current message touches on both these themes — postage stamps honoring the heritage and contributions of black americans are being discontinued and destroyed for the most basic of economic reasons : because people don ’ t buy them . <PARA> in this particular case , however , those feelings are misplaced : the united states postal service ( usps ) is neither discontinuing the black heritage series of postage stamps nor planning to destroy the remaining stock of those issues . the series has been going strong ever since 1978 , and the 2007 stamp ( the 30th entry in the series ) features singer ella fitzgerald . there is no end to the black heritage series in sight no matter how well or poorly any of its individual stamps sell , but rumors claiming that the series is in danger of discontinuation due to low sales have been circulating since at least 2000 , when executive director of stamp services azeezaly s . jaffer issued an official usps media statement disclaiming those rumors : <PARA> this policy was confirmed yet again by the usps in a march 2005 press release : <PARA> in 2007 the usps confirmed yet again that not only are black heritage stamps being neither discontinued nor destroyed , but that the series is one of its most popular issues : <PARA> exhorting people to buy black heritage stamps as a way of honoring the memories of the individuals they depict ( and black americans in general ) is a worthy cause ; such efforts need not be based on misinformation to succeed .	
unproven	origins : we don ’ t yet know anything about the origins or authenticity of this piece . the putative scanned images of actress lindsay lohan ‘ s american express card and driver ’ s license may have been produced by someone who found her dropped wallet , or they may have been produced by someone who had access to her personal possessions by some other means . the text accompanying the images may be an accurate account written by the same person who found the wallet and created the scans , or it may be a completely fabricated account that someone else tacked on to the images . all we know for sure is that the new york post reported ms . lohan did in fact misplace her purse , and someone found it in new york ’ s upper east side on 4 december 2004 : <PARA> [ lohan ] apparently misplaced her handbag , which was found saturday by a guest at a party at an upper east side bar for alums of providence college . <PARA> the lucky finder was showing off lohan ’ s california driver ’ s license , her black american express card and other things she ’ d rather we didn ’ t mention . <PARA> “ it was like when you ’ re in fifth grade and one girl in the corner shows off her boobs ,” chuckled one titillated bystander . “ people were dying to see .” <PARA> the lucky finder was showing off lohan ’ s california driver ’ s license , her black american express card and other things she ’ d rather we didn ’ t mention . <PARA> “ it was like when you ’ re in fifth grade and one girl in the corner shows off her boobs ,” chuckled one titillated bystander . “ people were dying to see .” <PARA> frankly , the account provided with the scanned images sounds rather less like the words of a cautious wallet - finder and more like an attempt to sling some mud in ms . lohan ’ s direction . perhaps it ’ s no coincidence that this item started infiltrating inboxes in early december 2004 , right after a few dozen photos of the 18 - year - old actress partying with friends in new york over thanksgiving weekend also started circulated on the internet , prompting her publicist to deny that ms . lohan smokes marijuana . <PARA> ( only ms . lohan ’ s street address was blacked out in the original version of the images displayed above . we have also blacked out portions of the american express card number and the driver ’ s license number , since we don ’ t know for sure that those documents , if real , have since been invalidated and reissued with new numbers . we also don ’ t know why the driver ’ s license gives ms . lohan ’ s middle name as dee when nearly every other source lists her middle name as being morgan .)

true	origins : it ’ s a chilling scene : a video clip shows a vehicle as it speeds through an intersection and runs broadside into another car ; a pedestrian crossing the street breaks into a run to run to get out of the way of the out - of - control vehicles , but the struck car rolls on top of him . the video is all the more chilling because it isn ’ t a scene from a <PARA> movie , nor is it the product of special effects wizardry — it ’ s the real thing , captured by a red - light enforcement camera . <PARA> the accident seen in the video occurred at 12 : 40 p . m . on 23 may 2004 at the intersection of third street and <PARA> edwin c . moses boulevard in dayton , ohio . betty j . hayslip , 75 , of new lebanon , driving a pt <PARA> cruiser , ran a red light and struck a subaru driven by albertina l . walker , 41 , of dayton . the collision caused the subaru to roll over one and a half times ; it came to rest upside - down and in the process crashed into pedestrian scott tegtmeyer , 42 , of dayton . <PARA> tegtmeyer , who was crossing the street in the same direction as the pt cruiser and had just reached the curb on the opposite side , can be seen in the video breaking into a desperate run as the collided vehicles bear down on him . he could not react quickly enough , however , and the subaru rolled atop of him , dragging him several feet across the intersection . although medics who found tegtmeyer ’ s bloodied body amidst a sea of broken glass initially pronounced him dead at the scene , he began breathing while in transit with paramedics and was fully resuscitated by doctors . <PARA> investigators said that at the time of the accident the crosswalk signal was red , and therefore tegtmeyer should not have been crossing the street . they also reported that tegtmeyer miraculously escaped alive because the dent in the side of the subaru caused by the crash created a hollow space that allowed the vehicle to roll over him without crushing him to death . neither vehicle was carrying any passengers , and both drivers escaped with only minor injuries . <PARA> the crash was captured by one of the automated red - light enforcement cameras installed at a dozen intersections around dayton to help reduce crashes caused by drivers running red lights . each camera records 12 - second motion videos used to issue citations to offending motorists .	
false	origins : beginning in january 2005 , rumors circulated nationwide that jon heder , the 26 - year - old star of the film napoleon dynamite , had died in tragic fashion . some people heard he ’ d arrived at his final destination via an automobile accident that snapped his neck ; others heard the grim reaper came to him in the form of a drug overdose , most commonly cocaine or crack cocaine . <PARA> we ’ re happy to report the young man is still very much alive . postdating the rumors of his demise was his appearance as a guest on the tonight show on 2 february 2005 . he is currently working on two other films , just like heaven and moving mcallister . in a 21 march news article about the rumor of his death , heder said “ yeah , and apparently it ’ s <PARA> not true .” <PARA> the 2004 movie napoleon dynamite came to the attention of the movie - going public at the sundance film festival . made for just $ 400 , 000 by jared hess , then a film student at brigham young university , it became a nationwide phenomenon , grossing $ 44 . 5 million in the united states . <PARA> lines from it are being quoted in high schools across the nation . the film has also served to increase teens ’ vocabulary by introducing liger , a word documented as entering the english language in 1938 , to a generation of newly - minted moviegoers . unlike the fictive cabbit ( cat - rabbit cross ) and jackalope ( jackrabbit - antelope mixture ), ligers are real felines that can result from the mating of male lions and female tigers . <PARA> the rumor of the fledgling actor ’ s death is touted as true on a web page which appears to have been created in february 2005 . it has also been discussed on various message boards , including in this thread and this thread on fox searchlight and in this thread in the internet movie database ’ s online community . <PARA> how the whispers started is anyone ’ s guess . while they might have been manufactured to create buzz for an offering new to the dvd / home video market , such a theory stumbles on the pre - rumor success of the film : it sold 1 . 35 million copies on its first day in stores in december 2004 and was the top - selling dvd for the pre - christmas week ending december 26 . it has since remained in the top 10 list of rentals and sales . a more likely wellspring for the fiction lies in a combination of the actor ’ s religious background , a recurring element in contemporary lore , and some old - fashioned mishearing and garbling . <PARA> jon heder is a mormon , and popular culture regards the young male adherents of that religion to be particularly clean - living and upstanding . his sudden demise would therefore be regarded by many as a double tragedy in that not only would a promising newcomer to the film industry <PARA> have been lost to the world , but so would a person of presumed moral fiber and virtue . all deaths are losses to be grieved over , but we are programmed to feel an especial sense of anguish over the passing of young people because their lives have ended before they ’ ve truly begun . this evocation of mourning gets elevated to an even higher level in instances where the short - lived decedent had already been dealt more than a rightful share of tragedy during his or her existence , or possessed talent now lost to the community , or was a singularly likeable or praiseworthy person . <PARA> in jon heder ’ s case , while his talent and youth work to fuel the rumor of his demise , it ’ s the presumption of a saintly lifestyle that gives it an extra push . expiring in either of the manners described would tend to topple him from the pedestal widespread stereotyping would place him upon , and gossip so loves to feast on a fallen angel . death by overdose of an illegal drug tends to be proof of illicit drug use , a hobby that would poke great holes in a choirboy image . likewise , a young celebrity ’ s perishing in a car crash gives off the aroma of foolhardy behavior on the part of the fellow called to glory — unstated yet worked into the fabric of the whisper is the supposition of the deceased ’ s having been driving too fast , or in a reckless fashion , or having been under the influence of drugs or alcohol . more deeply buried in such hypothesis is the surmise that fame had gone to the lad ’ s head , with success on the screen leading to fast cars and foolish living and ultimately a pine box . <PARA> fabrications about the demise of celebrities or pop culture icons deemed too young to have passed away abound . the quintessential hoax of this ilk is the “ paul is dead ” belief attaching to paul mccartney — it began in 1969 and at least among some continues to this day . other famed personages scuttlebutt had pushing up daisies even as they themselves continued to traverse this mortal coil include william hung of american idol fame , subway pitchman jared fogel , children ’ s television host steve burns of blue ’ s clues , and even the dog from the taco bell commercials . <PARA> barbara “ wracked by ilk ” mikkelson	
unproven	origins : this dubious account first came to us in e - mail in october 2004 . frankly , we don ’ t yet know what to make of it — we ’ re as yet unable to locate information about the origin of raising a finger when exiting a house of worship . according to a number of our readers , the practice does indeed take place in some baptist and ame ( african methodist episcopal ) <PARA> houses of worship among those who need to enter or exit during the sermon or at other points in the service where the congregation is being addressed ( e . g .; church announcements , scripture reading ). in those instances , those on their way out or in hold up a finger . the custom seems to be more common among elderly parishioners , a datapoint that serves to indicate the observance hails from an earlier time . <PARA> although the e - mailed account names the area being exited as the ‘ sanctuary ,’ it is better identified as the nave . a strict definition of ‘ sanctuary ’ as it relates to church buildings describes it as the region around the altar used by the clergy and choir ( often enclosed by a lattice or railing or in some other fashion set off from the congregation ). however , a great number of folks have come to understand the term as meaning the whole of a church ’ s open area , both the chancel ( where the service is conducted from ) and the nave ( where the parishioners sit ). <PARA> there are problems with this supposed origin . first , if a master had brought some of his slaves to a public event and seated them in that building ’ s balcony , he wouldn ’ t have been keeping an eye on them throughout whatever it was he ’ d come to see . given that his attention would have been directed towards the figures enacting whatever public affairs drama was underway ( e . g ., political speech , criminal trial ), he wouldn ’ t have seen upraised hands among his servants , ensconced as they were on a higher level and probably to the back of him . also , it would have bordered on unthinkable for slaves to risk disrupting public functions with their comings and goings , yet the premise of this origin has it that this practice was so commonplace as to have inspired a widely understood ritual of their raising their hands to seek permission to leave , getting it by way of a nod from their masters , then holding up a finger to signify to others that permission for the act underway had been duly sought and granted . <PARA> holding up a finger as a way of broadcasting certain intelligences is one of the many non - verbal ways we communicate specific messages to others . the gesture described ( index finger pointing upwards , other fingers curled into a loose fist , the palm facing those being signaled , and the hand presented at approximately face height ) conveys three starkly dissimilar interruption - related messages , with context dictating which meaning carries the day . in all three , the raised digit might well represent a ‘ 1 ,’ signaling announcement by the finger - raiser that his request , demand , or absence will not be of lengthy duration ( i . e ., “ this will just take one minute , so bear with me ”): <PARA> the meaning of the finger raise as practiced among baptist and ame congregations most likely falls into the third category listed above , that of the apologetic excuse , the “ whoops , i ’ m sorry but i really need to be attending to something else right now , but i promise to be back in two shakes of a lamb ’ s tail .” it therefore signals a self - generated act , not a permission gained from another . <PARA> to us , the backstory about slaves announcing their absences having been duly sanctioned sounds contrived to make a religious point by way of a pun . just as the “ who will take the son ?” legend draws on word play to make its point ( the person who takes the portrait of the deceased son gets the bulk of a wealthy man ’ s estate , the person who accepts christ as his savior inherits the kingdom of god — on both levels they “ take the son ”), so does this story turn on “ my master has excused me .” what supposedly started as slaves ’ way of saying their owners had granted them leave to go relieve themselves now signifies churchgoers have been forgiven by god ; that is , washed clean of their sins by virtue of the services just attended . <PARA> our readers speculate those lifted fingers serve : <PARA> the e - mail about the supposed practice of holding up a finger to communicate one is on a duly sanctioned foray makes the point “ which goes to show that you should investigate rituals before you follow them .” an extremely well - traveled urban legend about a cooking secret handed down from generation to generation spins on this same axis . <PARA> barbara “ secret squirreled ” mikkelson	
unproven	origins : “ the ” legend about “ gloomy sunday ” is a sort of meta - legend that encompasses the following claims : <PARA> a little background for those not familiar with this legend : <PARA> “ gloomy sunday ” was written in 1933 by two hungarians : rezso seress ( music ) and laszlo javor ( lyrics ). the song supposedly drew little ( adverse ) attention until 1936 , when it began to be connected with a rash of suicides in hungary and was allegedly banned there . american musicians and singers soon jumped at the chance to record instrumental and translated versions of the “ hungarian suicide song ,” and by the end of 1936 several recordings were available to american audiences . ( the billie holiday version , recorded several years later , was probably the most popular english - language version of “ gloomy sunday .”) <PARA> the english lyrics ( which reportedly don ’ t do justice to the original hungarian ) go something like this : <PARA> sunday is gloomy , my hours are slumberless . <PARA> dearest , the shadows i live with are numberless . <PARA> little white flowers will never awaken you , <PARA> not where the black coach of sorrow has taken you . <PARA> angels have no thought of ever returning you . <PARA> would they be angry if i thought of joining you ? <PARA> gloomy sunday . <PARA> gloomy is sunday ; with shadows i spend it all . <PARA> my heart and i have decided to end it all . <PARA> soon there ’ ll be candles and prayers that are sad , i know . <PARA> death is no dream , for in death i ’ m caressing you . <PARA> with the last breath of my soul i ’ ll be blessing you . <PARA> gloomy sunday . <PARA> gloomy is sunday ; with shadows i spend it all . <PARA> my heart and i have decided to end it all . <PARA> soon there ’ ll be candles and prayers that are sad , i know . <PARA> death is no dream , for in death i ’ m caressing you . <PARA> with the last breath of my soul i ’ ll be blessing you . <PARA> gloomy sunday . <PARA> on to the legends : <PARA> i don ’ t know how any of these claims could be verified short of paging through old hungarian newspapers ; even then , it would be difficult at this late date to separate exaggerated and fabricated reports from true ones . i suspect that this portion of the legend is trivially true , a combination of hungary ’ s historically high suicide rate and the assumption of a causal — rather than a coincidental — relationship between the song and suicides that caused rumors and media reports to be greatly exaggerated . <PARA> hungary has had the highest suicide rate of any country for many years ( as high as 45 . 9 per 100 , 000 people in 1984 ), so a few dozen suicides there over a year ’ s time certainly wouldn ’ t have been unusual , even in 1936 . nor is it at all uncommon for suicides to work something from popular songs or books or films into their deaths . only when one particular song was coincidentally linked to a sufficient number of suicides to draw attention to all the suicides in which it played a part did people start to claim that it was somehow the cause of these deaths .	
false	origins : at the end of 1971 , only one member remained of the quintet of byrds who had initiated the folk - rock boom six years earlier when they scored # 1 hits by <PARA> grafting their lush harmonies and jangly guitar sound onto traditional and modern folk songs such as “ mr . tambourine man ” and “ turn ! turn ! turn !” although the other four original byrds had long since departed the group , founder roger ( originally jim ) mcguinn had weathered a series of personnel changes over the years and kept the byrds going as a recording and touring act . <PARA> the byrds ’ last gasp as a studio group came with the november 1971 release of their final album , farther along . many critics panned the lp as a hurriedly - recorded collection of disappointingly tepid songs , and some of them later suggested that the weakness of the farther along material was attributable to the members of this final incarnation of the byrds sensing that the end of the line was near and withholding their best material for release on future solo efforts . roger mcguinn , in particular , was said to be distracted by promise of a reunion of the original five byrds , leading to his being unfocused and detached during the production of farther along . <PARA> these criticisms prompted byrds biographer johnny rogan to note a decade later that roger mcguinn had been so uninterested in the byrds ’ final album that a mere roadie ( i . e ., a person engaged to transport and set up equipment and perform errands for musicians on tour ) had been allowed to write and sing one of the songs appearing on it : <PARA> “ bb class road ” is another below - average track , sung by the byrds roadie stuart “ dinkie ” dawson . dawson had the basic idea for the song and gene parsons added the melody . sadly , it must be admitted that this song has no distinguishable byrds sound whatsoever . literally , it could be anyone singing and playing . that a mere roadie could be given leave to appear on an album as easily as this is a testament to mcguinn ’ s loss of control and general lack of interest in the group . <PARA> it ’ s easy to see how a listener might have formed this impression of the song in question , “ bb class road .”: it didn ’ t much sound like a byrds track ; it listed the byrds ’ roadie , stuart “ dinkie ” dawson , as a co - writer ; and the lyrics were a first - person account of life on the road , complete with a spoken introduction dedicating the song to “ all the road managers that are worth a dang anywhere in the word ”: <PARA> in fact , although roadie stuart dawson had a hand in the writing and recording of “ bb class road ,” the song was actually sung by the byrds ’ drummer , gene parsons . the reason it didn ’ t sound much like the byrds was because parsons ’ voice was unfamiliar to many listeners ( he ’ d only sung lead on a couple of byrds tracks prior to the release of farther along ), and he departed from his normal vocal delivery on “ bb class road ” to assume an alternate persona as a roadie . <PARA> as the liner notes to the 2000 cd re - issue of the farther along album describe the song : <PARA> co - written by gene parsons and byrds ’ roadie stuart “ dinky ” dawson , this quirky novelty song about life on the road was completed at a time when the group was still actively touring . parsons ’ gruff vocal concludes with a barrage of beer bottles tumbling over his drum kit . “ i was imitating and taking on a different persona ,” he recalls . “ stuart and i collaborated and it ’ s me growling and howling out the vocal . dinky may have sung background and was involved in the studio . you can hear broken glass on there , that was his idea .” <PARA> although farther along proved to be the final record produced by what was known as the “ cbs byrds ” ( i . e ., the group then under contract to columbia records ), the original five members reunited briefly the following year to record an eponymously titled album for another label .	
false	origins : tinseltown is full of tragic tales ( of varying degrees of truthfulness ) about beloved actors who , having succumbed to the illusion of their profession , <PARA> ultimately became unable to separate their own personalities from those of the characters they portrayed . none of these stories has a more bizarre ending than the one told about george reeves , tv ’ s superman , who allegedly met with an accidental death while attempting to duplicate a feat possible only by someone possessed of his character ’ s super powers . <PARA> george reeves ( born george keefer brewer in 1914 ) began his hollywood career in a variety of bit parts in the late 1930s , including a small role in the epic film gone with the wind , and worked steadily ( if unspectacularly ) throughout the 1940s before landing the role that would finally make his name and face a familiar one in american households : superman . the popular superhero had been featured in numerous comics , radio shows , and films during the 1940s before he was brought to the small screen in a syndicated television series that began production in 1951 with george reeves in the title role . the series proved itself popular when it finally reached local stations in 1952 , additional episodes were filmed from 1953 to 1957 . although the show ’ s budget was quite limited , the series was tremendously popular for a program that did not appear on a network ’ s prime time schedule , and george reeves became the living embodiment of superman to millions of american children . <PARA> as plenty of actors have discovered over the years , fame sometimes exacts a high price from those who achieve it . despite his being more popular and recognizable than ever , george reeves became typecast as superman and was unable to find work when production of the adventures of superman series ended in 1957 . despondent and depressed over his inability to secure other acting roles , the 45 - year - old reeves committed suicide on 16 june 1959 , shooting himself in the head in the upstairs bedroom of his beverly hills home while a party was in progress in the living room below . <PARA> ( many claims have been made that depict reeves ’ death as a murder rather than a suicide . he was allegedly quite upbeat at the time of his death about hearing that the superman series was going to resume production soon and thus had no reason to kill himself . rumors also posited that the husband of a woman with whom reeves had recently broken <PARA> off a 10 - year affair had hired a hitman to kill the actor . none of this speculation has any substantive evidence to back it up , however .) <PARA> shortly after reeves ’ tragic death , the bizarre story that would stigmatize his untimely end even further began to circulate : reeves , believing he possessed superman ’ s super powers , died when he jumped out the window of a multi - story building , expecting that he would fly as his superhero character did rather than plummet to the ground . ( alternate versions of the rumor had reeves dying after attempting some other demonstration of super strength , such as having bullets or a cannon fired directly at his chest .) <PARA> reeves may have been depressed , and he may have been despondent that he was no longer needed for the only role hollywood seemingly found him suitable for , but he was under no illusion that he was the character he played . the legend about his unusual manner of death likely began as a combination of attempts to rationalize his taking of his own life (“ he was crazy ” providing a more comprehensible explanation for suicide to many than the complex realities do , especially to people familiar only with a victim ’ s public persona and not the details of his private life ) and the apocryphal stories of children killing themselves in similar fashion that already been circulating for several years . ( an even more unusual take on this legend had reeves killing himself because he was despondent over the harm caused to all the kids who had donned superman capes and jumped from heights , expecting to fly as they had seen reeves do countless times on the tv show .) <PARA> we all too often expect our heroes to be larger - than - life in everything , including their deaths . when the facts don ’ t meet our expectations , we manufacture them . george reeves may not have died a hero , but many of us have been led to believe that he died trying to be one , however misguided that attempt may have been .	
true	origins : in <PARA> 1983 , caustic comedienne joan rivers received a tremendous career boost when the king of late - night television , johnny carson , designated her his “ permanent ” guest host for the tonight show , thereby providing her valuable national tv exposure as she filled in during johnny ’ s many days off and vacations . within a few years , however , carson was left feeling betrayed when fox announced that not only had they lured joan rivers away from the tonight show to star in the inaugural series on their new national television network , but that rivers ’ new vehicle would be a competing late - night talk show going head - to - head with carson ’ s own program . <PARA> launched amid a torrent of publicity in october 1986 , the late show starring joan rivers proved to be a rather disappointing copy of the tonight show with a less engaging host , and once the novelty wore off , viewers turned elsewhere . rivers left the show seven months later , and the program ( renamed the late show ) carried on with a series of guest hosts , primarily arsenio hall . <PARA> during her brief tenure , though , rivers managed to create one of the more controversial moments in television history . dallas star victoria principal was one of the comedienne ’ s favorite targets for needling — “ victoria principal married a plastic surgeon . isn ’ t that convenient ... and free ,” ran one of her jokes — and rivers recalled some of her other jabs at the actress shortly after leaving her fox show : <PARA> i must say , though , most of the people i interview are a delight . and they nearly always want to come back . well , nearly always . victoria principal won ’ t . she was claiming she was younger than she was . and when i proved she couldn ’ t possibly be , she got hysterical . it made great tv . <PARA> the falling - out between ms . principal and ms . rivers stemmed from an on - air incident which the latter described in her 1991 autobiography , still talking : <PARA> victoria principal was my first guest in 1983 when she was on dallas , and i wanted to know about her break - up with andy gibb of the bee gees . “ did you keep the ring ?” i asked . well , she denied they were engaged and denied there had been an engagement ring . at that moment the audience and the camera <PARA> disappeared , and we were like two women at a kitchen table . “ but you showed me one ,” i reminded her . “ you and andy gibb came to my dressing room in las vegas . you had the ring . you ’ d just gotten engaged . <PARA> “ why was it on your left hand ?” i wanted to know . “ it ’ s my best hand ,” she said . “ for what ?” i asked . <PARA> after we went off the air , victoria said sweetly , “ i ’ ll get you next time .” and she did come back , determined to win — came on all vulnerable and innocent , playing the victim . but she made a big mistake . early in the show she said this was her thirty - third birthday . later she told me she was born in 1950 , the first american baby in japan after the war . <PARA> well , i know when the war was over — 1945 . let ’ s see , subtract that from 1983 and you get ... i said , “ victoria , you ’ ve ruined yourself again .” i teased her , “ okay , i was born in 1950 , too .” she wanted to know where i bought my birth certificate . “ same place you bought yours ,” i said . <PARA> when the show finished , she stormed off the stage in a fury . but that same year andy gibb was my guest . agreeing that victoria had claimed it was an engagement ring , he said , “ she played with the truth a little bit .” i asked him how old victoria was when they broke up two years earlier . he said , “ same age she is now , i think .” <PARA> disappeared , and we were like two women at a kitchen table . “ but you showed me one ,” i reminded her . “ you and andy gibb came to my dressing room in las vegas . you had the ring . you ’ d just gotten engaged . <PARA> “ why was it on your left hand ?” i wanted to know . “ it ’ s my best hand ,” she said . “ for what ?” i asked . <PARA> after we went off the air , victoria said sweetly , “ i ’ ll get you next time .” and she did come back , determined to win — came on all vulnerable and innocent , playing the victim . but she made a big mistake . early in the show she said this was her thirty -

star ken kercheval , who played the brother of victoria principal ’ s character on the popular nighttime soap opera . his presence prompted rivers to try phoning ms . principal live on the show , ostensibly to wish her a happy birthday ( an event that was three weeks away ) but more likely as an excuse to provoke the actress with more questions about her true age . after several failed attempts to get through to principal ’ s home ( due to a continual busy signal ), rivers finally called the operator and asked for an emergency break - in to the line . the talk show host had to repeat principal ’ s unlisted , unpublished phone number out loud to the operator , thereby broadcasting that sensitive personal information to millions of viewers . <PARA> a few weeks later , newspapers carried reports that victoria principal had filed a $ 3 million lawsuit against the comedienne over the stunt : <PARA> dallas star victoria principal filed a $ 3 million suit monday against joan rivers , claiming she was deluged with phone calls after the comedian blurted out the actress ’ home phone number on her talk show . <PARA> principal said rivers was interviewing dallas co -

true	origins : the january 2005 death of beloved comedian johnny carson , host of the late - night tonight show for thirty years ( from 1962 - 92 ) brought a flood of <PARA> reminiscences as friends , associates , and fans all discussed and shared their memories of favorite bits from johnny ’ s three - decade tenure as the king of talk show hosts . some of those memories were apocryphal , however , as johnny carson has long been the figure to whom any number of unsourced jokes , risqué comments , or witticisms supposedly uttered on television have been attributed . <PARA> we ’ re pleased , therefore , to be able to report that the monologue transcribed above ( an oft - quoted piece which was reproduced widely in the days after johnny ’ s passing ) is a genuine example of mr . carson ’ s tonight show humor . his comedic essay on democracy and freedom was inspired by events of the early 1990s , namely the lurching halt to the cold war and the disintegration of the soviet union . as various republics formerly a part of the u . s . s . r . were moving towards independence in 1991 , johnny responded that year with his wry take entitled “ democracy is ,” delivered on the tonight show to the accompaniment of the studio band ’ s humming rendition of “ the battle hymn of the republic ,” on a date which ten years later would coincidentally become associated with some very profound issues regarding democracy and freedom : september 11 .	
true	origins : sesame street <PARA> has offered a variety of social messages and images since its debut in 1969 . its regular characters include adults and children of different ethnic and racial backgrounds , and it has featured characters and guest stars with various disabilities . <PARA> in september 2002 it added to its cast of muppets a female character who is hiv - positive . segments including this new muppet will air only in south africa ( where the show is called takalani sesame — takalani means “ be happy ” in the tshivenda language ), but it is possible that eventually this character will appear in shows broadcast to the other eight nations that air sesame street . <PARA> the south african character has been named kami and will be a female mustard - colored furry muppet who likes nature , telling stories and collecting stuff . kami is a “ monster muppet ” like grover or elmo , the least human - like of the sesame cast , said joel schneider , <PARA> vice president of sesame workshop . the muppet will associate freely with the show ’ s other characters as a way to fight stereotypes about people with the virus , said yvonne kgame of the south african broadcasting corporation . <PARA> “ we know that she ’ ll be lively , alert , friendly , outgoing , and hiv - positive ,” said schneider , who in july 2002 announced the character to delegates attending the 14th international aids conference in barcelona . “ it ’ s about instilling positive attitudes toward people who are hiv - infected ,” kgame said . <PARA> north americans may wonder at the wisdom of inserting an hiv - positive character into a show aimed at tykes 3 to 7 , little ones we would deem too young to expose to such harsh realities . but in south africa , where takalani sesame airs , one in nine people is infected with hiv , and many of these are children . in that country , the horror of the disease is further compounded by the stigma attached to it , especially if the infected person is female . <PARA> the new character is aimed at undoing some of that stigma through presenting her as a happy , outgoing creature . <PARA> in an odd fashion , this july 2002 news story about a new muppet echoes a far earlier and utterly false rumor . in 1990 , the grapevine was a ’ buzz with whispers that sesame street planned to kill off ernie as a way to teach young children about death . <PARA> barbara “ teaching aid ” mikkelson	
false	origins : the death of a popular entertainer sets the world to mourning ; the passing of two in a short span of time adds a factor of anticipation that yet one more demise is imminent to fulfill the maxim that “ deaths come in threes .” the entertainment world experienced such a triumvirate of losses in june 2009 , when the passing of long - time tonight show announcer ed mcmahon on the 23rd was followed two <PARA> days later by the deaths of farrah fawcett and singer michael jackson . <PARA> shortly afterwards , a rumor about an eerie coincidence involving these three figures began to spread : farrah fawcett and michael jackson had once appeared on the tonight show on the same day , putting all three entertainers on the same stage at the same time . <PARA> the date typically claimed for this unusual occurrence ( 18 september 1979 ) is clearly in error , as it is a day on which no new episode of the tonight show aired . that date featured a “ best of carson ” rerun of an episode from 23 march 1978 with guests walter matthau and bob uecker . <PARA> according to the guest search function at the johnny carson : the official tonight show web site , it ’ s a case of “ close but no cigar ”: the jackson five appeared on the tonight show on 19 august 1974 , and farrah fawcett was a guest on the show the following evening , 20 august 1974 . but even that proximity isn ’ t as close to matching the rumor as it might seem , as bandleader doc severinsen filled in for announcer ed mcmahon on both those dates ( while comedian bill cosby guest - hosted in johnny carson ’ s place ).	
true	quote : a musician for whom a young elvis presley auditioned advised him to “ stick to driving a truck , because you ’ ll never make it as a singer .” <PARA> origins : we all admire the prescient individual who can spot a diamond in the rough ; who has the vision to see great value in someone or something that everyone else has overlooked . conversely , we love to jeer <PARA> the fool who lets a valuable gem slip through his fingers , even if nobody else realized its worth at the time <PARA> either . <PARA> so it was with elvis presley . it was far from apparent during elvis ’ early adulthood that he was destined to become one of the most popular entertainers the world had ever seen . the day after elvis graduated high school in 1953 , he started work at m . b . parker machinists ’ shop for $ 33 a week . when elvis stopped by the studios of sam phillips ’ memphis recording service sometime that summer ( ostensibly to make a personal record “ to surprise his mother ”), he was , in the words of marion keisker , phillips ’ partner and receptionist , “ shy , a little woebegone , cradling his battered , beat - up child ’ s guitar .” while elvis waited to record a couple of tunes (“ my happiness ” and “ that ’ s when your heartaches begin ”), he asked miss keisker if she knew of any groups looking for a singer . she didn ’ t . <PARA> elvis knew he wanted to be a singer , but he didn ’ t know how to go about becoming one . he hung around the memphis recording service studios for the next several months and cut another personal record in january 1954 , but he accomplished little else in the way of becoming a professional artist . the most notable “ professional ” event of these early years was elvis ’ switching jobs ( because his previous employer had made him get a haircut ), taking a job driving a truck for crown electric driving at the princely sum of $ 40 per week in april 1954 . <PARA> a month later , elvis was excited that the big break he had been seeking might finally be at hand . ronnie smith , a fellow music enthusiast with whom elvis had played a few little <PARA> gigs was , at 16 , a member of a real professional band . this band was led by eddie bond , a 21 - year - old “ veteran ” musician who had been performing in memphis since he was 15 and was seeking to re - establish himself after having finished a stint in the navy . ronnie and elvis ran into each other , and ronnie mentioned that eddie was looking for a singer for their band . maybe elvis could try auditioning for the spot , ronnie suggested . <PARA> elvis duly showed up at a club called the hi hat shortly thereafter , where he met eddie bond and nervously performed a couple of songs onstage . bond turned him down . the reasons why bond turned him down have become confused over the years ( bond later claimed it was the club ’ s owners who forced him reject elvis ), but according to a mutual friend , bond told elvis to stick with driving a truck “ because you ’ re never going to make it as a singer .” <PARA> within a few months elvis presley would record “ that ’ s all right ( mama )” for sam phillips ’ sun records label . after the disc proved to be a hit in memphis , eddie bond had ronnie smith ask elvis if he ’ d like to sing with them now . elvis politely declined the invitation .	
false	origins : it was probably the single most often cited “ fact ” about any of the four monkees to appear in the multitude of teen fan magazines devoted to the group during <PARA> their heyday : that mike nesmith took up playing the guitar to restore dexterity to fingers damaged when a firecracker exploded in his hand . it was the perfect little bit of interesting information to head the sidebar to an article , especially since it helped to convince the public that at least one of the monkees could actually play a music instrument . and it was completely false : nesmith did injure his hand in an accident as a youngster , but the injury had nothing to do with a firecracker , and he didn ’ t take up the guitar until years later . <PARA> the way nesmith describes the story , he and some neighborhood kids were smashing rocks with a sledgehammer one day . mike was holding the target rock , and the sledgehammer came down on his hand instead of the rock . because mrs . nesmith followed the beliefs of christian science , young mike was not taken for medical treatment ; the bones in his hand were not set and did not heal properly . he permanently lost the use of one finger on his right hand as a result , a condition that was not ameliorated by his learning to play guitar . <PARA> mike ’ s start as a guitarist didn ’ t occur until several years later , when he was in his 20s . he had joined the u . s . air force not long after finishing high school , and while on pass one weekend he saw hoyt axton performing at a folk club in oklahoma . his stint in the air force ended prematurely after he “ tipped over a general ’ s plane one morning while cleaning it ,” and he asked his parents to stake him to a guitar , which he taught himself to play : <PARA> i figured that the easiest way to learn was by trial and error . i played records and tried to pick out the right chords as i listened . people told me i must be mad , that they way to do it was to go to a teacher or at least buy a tutor book . the result was that i could do a lot of things with a guitar that just weren ’ t meant to be done . <PARA> a memorable background story that could be used for promotional purposes was an essential part of the résumé of 60 ’ s pop stars , so the fictional firecracker tale — likely the invention of a publicist who spun it from the true thread of nesmith ’ s having suffered a hand injury as a child — has been continually published as fact for going on four decades now .	
false	variations : <PARA> origins : this legend originated in the mid - 1960s , no doubt inspired by the eccentricities of frank zappa ’ s music and appearance . as zappa himself wrote , however : <PARA> for the record , folks : i never took a shit on stage , and the closest i ever came to eating shit anywhere was at a holiday inn buffet in fayetteville , north carolina , in 1973 .	
false	origins : john denver ’ s father , henry john deutschendorf , was one of the first officers in the newly - formed united states air <PARA> force after world war ii , retiring as a lieutenant colonel . his son ( now known as john denver ) at one time had hopes of joining the air force himself , but his substandard eyesight precluded his becoming a military pilot . john denver received an army induction notice in 1964 , but he was classified 1 - y due to having lost two toes in a lawn mower accident and never served in any branch of the military . <PARA> the john denver “ sniper ” story is a typical example of the “ he ’ s not what he seems to be ” legend type , tales of contradictory excess generally applied to celebrities who entertain children or otherwise have a cloying public image that show them to be the opposites of their public images . ( other examples include uncle don and singer mariah carey .) thus john denver , known to the world as a gentle , nature - loving pop singer , is transformed into his antithesis : a professional killer . ( as was fred rogers of television ’ s mister rogers ’ neighborhood . he too was rumored to have been a sniper , with even his penchant for long - sleeved cardigans ascribed to his hiding tattoos from the eyes of curious little tykes . like denver , rogers never served in any branch of the military . he was an ordained minister in the united presbyterian church .) <PARA> consider the possible thought processes of whoever invented this rumor : “ hey , let ’ s make up something outrageous about that wimp john denver ! i know , we ’ ll <PARA> tell everybody he used to shoot people !” casting john denver as a hired killer for the mob being a bit too far - fetched , the rumor - mongers decide to present him as a soldier . ( an apt touch , since the controversial vietnam war had created a decidedly negative image of the military in the minds of a large segment of american youth in the early 1970s , when denver ’ s career was at its peak .) offering denver as a sniper was a double stroke of genius : it created the impression that not only was he a soldier , but that he actually shot people ( since plenty of military personnel serve in support of combat operations without ever firing a gun ); and it painted a picture of denver not just as a killer , but as a cowardly one who hid in buildings and shot unsuspecting victims . ( military snipers are actually well - trained professional soldiers who perform a difficult , demanding , and vital task at no small risk to themselves , but the civilian public ’ s general perception of a sniper , however , is someone like charles whitman : a man with a long - range rifle holed up in an impregnable tower , mercilessly gunning down defenseless , unarmed people .) <PARA> the fact that denver was the son of a career military officer and was of the right age to have served in the vietnam war most likely afforded this legend just the right touch of plausibility it needed to spread widely .	
unproven	the origins of “ you worry me ” remain murky : it first appeared on the internet in june 2002 , but our attempts to verify whether its real author is an american airlines pilot and / or someone named john maniscalco have so far led only to dead ends . <PARA> according to the faa registry , john maniscalco is indeed a real pilot , but this item was also printed in a less vitriolic form in the hyattsville , maryland , gazette ( under the title “ an open letter to my arab - muslim neighbors ”) on 12 october 2001 and credited to a kevin daly of beltsville . <PARA> newspaper publication of a piece as a letter to the editor is not a reliable indicator of true authorship , however , as demonstrated by another widely - circulated internet piece about president clinton that was printed in several different newspapers under the names of at least four different people . <PARA> the gazette letter might have been based on the internet version , or the internet version might be an altered transcription of the gazette letter ; john maniscalco might have been the original author ( or alterer ), or he might have been someone whose name became attached to the piece simply because he forwarded it to others . <PARA> aside from the question of authorship , this is not an item that can be branded “ true ” or “ false ,” because it ’ s merely someone ’ s expression of his opinions . thematically , it ’ s a more overt expression of the feelings conveyed by such ( apocryphal ) september 11 - related legends as the claim that no taxis were to be found around the world trade center the morning of the terrorist attacks : the fear and unease generated by the knowledge that the perpetrators were people who had been living among us undetected for months ; people who , although they may have been foreigners , were not out of place amidst the cultural diversity of america . how , then , do we now distinguish friend from foe ? wouldn ’ t it be so much easier if , as advocated in this essay , we could simply assume all arab - muslims to be guilty and demand them to demonstrate otherwise ? <PARA> but such an approach is not only inimical to many of the principles american stands for , it is also logically flawed . what terrorists bent on the destruction of the u . s . would hesitate to camouflage themselves by hypocritically waving american flags or professing a false love for america ? we cannot judge people by outward appearances alone , and that realization leaves us feeling scared and powerless .	
unproven	origins : the story of the “ red - faced vicar ” and eric clapton first appeared in the british press in february 1994 and was quickly picked up by american newspapers as well . <PARA> charming though the story may be , inconsistencies in the details indicate that it may be apocryphal . although most accounts don ’ t mention when this encounter supposedly took place , one report from june 1994 stated that had occurred “ earlier this year .” if the incident indeed took place during the same year in which it was reported to the press — and was reported accurately — then father ackroyd did not know eric clapton prior to 1994 . however , other press reports that appeared three years earlier ( after the sudden death of clapton ’ s son conor in 1991 ) indicated that father ackroyd had in fact already known eric clapton for several years prior to 1994 : <PARA> the rector of st peter and st paul ’ s in ewhurst , the rev dennis ackroyd , said he was saddened by the news . “ i know [ clapton ] very well . he has played in church for our children ’ s services and would slip into the back of the church from time to time . he is a lovely man ,” said mr ackroyd . “ the little boy came here too . it ’ s very sad news ,” he added . <PARA> even if the discrepancy in time were somehow accounted for ( perhaps the vicar waited several years before sharing the anecdote with the press ), it is still hard to believe that father ackroyd could not have known or recognized eric clapton , whenever they met . clapton was certainly no newcomer to the area ; he was born and raised in ripley , surrey , and he had <PARA> resided in ewhurst since purchasing a 20 - room mansion there in 1969 . the notion that father ackroyd ( even if newly - assigned to the parish ) could be completely unaware of clapton ’ s presence in ewhurst — or , that even if he were aware of clapton ’ s presence , he failed to make the connection between a guitar - playing fellow named “ eric ” living in a mansion and eric clapton — is rather far - fetched and fits too neatly into the stereotype of the unworldly cleric . <PARA> this tale is an example of the “ unrecognized celebrity ” genre : a story about an ordinary person who makes an embarrassing request of a celebrity he fails to recognize , either because the celebrity also appears to be unremarkable when removed from his usual milieu ( e . g ., tourist mistakes casually - dressed film star for gardener ), or because he is famous in a field not familiar to the person ( e . g ., housewife mistakes an nfl or nba star for a porter at an airport ). it also plays on a related stereotype of clerics as isolated and out of touch with popular culture — a feature which may even have helped the legend spread . after all , who would disbelieve a man of the cloth ?

tim – “ a number dictated to me by a higher intelligence ”; p - nut – “ knowing a little numerology and studying a little magic , which i do ; in some factions , three is man and 11 is magic . so 311 is like male magic .” <PARA> and according to nick hexum ( lead vocalist and songwriter ): <PARA> we used to tell people that three minutes and 11 seconds was the perfect length for a song . we used to say that it meant three plus one plus one , which was true . and taco bell explanations or not , the truth behind the name is every bit as risque as anything likely to be dreamed up by their fans . no white - sheeted klansmen though . <PARA> ‘ twas group member aaron “ p - nut ” wills who supposedly chose the name , claiming that 311 is the police code for indecent exposure . according to nick hexum : “ our original guitarist was arrested for skinny dipping , and they put 311 on the ticket ”: <PARA> 311 is an omaha police code for indecent exposure . one rainy day , p - nut and some friends went skinny dipping in a public pool . they were apprehended by police . one of p - nut ’ s friends ( jim watson ) was arrested , cuffed ( naked ) and taken home to his parents . he was issued a citation for a code 311 ( indecent exposure ). we thought this was funny , so we took it as our band name . after the humor of the name wore off , we still kept it because we liked that it was just abstract and that it did not define us in anyway . the name did not describe our sound or our politics , it just let the music speak for itself . <PARA> the kkk rumor has forced the group to become more forthcoming about the meaning behind the name . candor aside , they still have problems in that there are those who are determined to believe that there is a connection to the klan : <PARA> in 1997 there was a rumor going around that the name 311 stood for kkk because k is the 11th letter of the alphabet ( 3k ). as a result , some high schools , including westside high school , banned students from wearing 311 t - shirts . we issued the following statement : <PARA> “ it has come to our attention that there is a very unsettling rumor circulating regarding the name of our band ‘ 311 .’ we have been told that certain white supremacist groups use the numbers 311 to represent kkk . this is a most unfortunate coincidence and one that is extremely disturbing to us . we would like to state for the record that this is completely at odds with our personal beliefs . we believe the only people worth hating are organized haters like the kkk . anyone familiar with our lyrics knows how we feel . our lyrics make a strong stand against racism and a strong stand for positivity and unity . the name of our band originally comes from an omaha police citation for indecent exposure . we thought it was funny at the time . now our name simply means – five friends from omaha making music . music that stands for peace and unity .” <PARA> “ it has come to our attention that there is a very unsettling rumor circulating regarding the name of our band ‘ 311 .’ we have been told that certain white supremacist groups use the numbers 311 to represent kkk . this is a most unfortunate coincidence and one that is extremely disturbing to us . we would like to state for the record that this is completely at odds with our personal beliefs . we believe the only people worth hating are organized haters like the kkk . anyone familiar with our lyrics knows how we feel . our lyrics make a strong stand against racism and a strong stand for positivity and unity . the name of our band originally comes from an omaha police citation for indecent exposure . we thought it was funny at the time . now our name simply means – five friends from omaha making music . music that stands for peace and unity .” <PARA> mind you , the kkk rumor wasn ’ t all bad news for the band . <PARA> the kkk controversy had a paradoxical impact on 311 ’ s notoriety . major publications such as rolling stone and spin magazine and usa today suddenly became interested in following the band ’ s career . ditto for mtv . “ in less than a week , it was everywhere ,” band member doug martinez said . “ it gave the media a spot to work from but it says something else about the sensational aspect of the low - brow journalism of certain media .” <PARA> the final nail in the rumor ’ s coffin came when the band recorded the song “ silver ,” with the following lyrics : <PARA> of the racist institutions , simple minds belong ;

( given free choice between plain water and a bowl of milk , cats generally head for the water unless milk has been the only liquid offered to them from weaning onwards . put more simply , unless the cat has been taught to like milk , it generally won ’ t seek out that substance on its own .) <PARA> another theory advanced as to why a cat would want to harm a baby relates to the jealousy the pet will supposedly experience when the little bundle from heaven is brought into the household . no longer the center of attention , the neglected pet is allegedly capable of setting about to get rid of what it sees as the usurper . this theory is of far more recent coinage than the bit of lore it purports to explain , though , coming into fashion no earlier than the 20th century ( while the “ smother ” belief dates to at least the 1700s ). <PARA> in 1791 a jury at a coroner ’ s inquest in england rendered a verdict to the effect that a plymouth child had met his death by a cat sucking out its breath . the superstition itself is older , with print sightings of it recorded from 1607 and 1708 , so that 1791 verdict should be viewed with the realization that the jury was probably influenced by a snippet of “ everybody knows ” lore when it came time to explain a death for which there was no apparent cause . <PARA> it is possible a cat might lie across the face of a sleeping child and thus upon extremely rare instances accidentally cause a death , but that is not the old wives ’ tale at hand wherein the cat does so with malice aforethought . a news story emerging in december 2000 appeared at first blush to be an instance of this sort of accident when a woman said she found her six - week - old son dead in his crib with the family cat laying on the baby ’ s face . further examination by pathologists laid this theory to rest — they attributed the 21 december 2000 death of 6 - week - old keiron payne to sudden infant death syndrome . <PARA> what is on record , however , are any number of accidental deaths of sleeping children caused by their parents ’ rolling over onto them , or from their turning around to face into a pillow . children have also suffocated <PARA> from being left sleeping on their tummies on waterbeds . and then there is “ sudden infant death syndrome ” ( sids ), the inexplicable passing of an otherwise healthy child in its sleep . <PARA> tragedy is hard enough to bear without its also being inexplicable . better to blame the cat than to admit the cause of a child ’ s death is unknown . . . and thus could strike down another youngster at some future date . <PARA> folk beliefs work to give folks a sense of control over their destinies and thus some small measure of security in a capricious world . if a parent can believe that preventing crib death is but a matter of keeping the cat out of the baby ’ s room , that parent will sleep a lot easier than one who realizes such a tragedy could occur any night , cat or no cat . <PARA> cats have long been viewed as evil , and for centuries a number of superstitions featuring their bringing bad luck have abounded . similar to the “ sucking life from a child by swallowing its breath ” superstition was one about not raising a kitten and a baby together , lest the cat thrive and the child waste away . in that superstition , the cat was supposed to be stealing the child ’ s vitality by magic . <PARA> as to how widely believed the “ breath sucking ” tale is , a 1929 article in the nebraska state journal quoted a doctor as having said he had seen “ the family pet in the very act of sucking a child ’ s breath , lying on the baby ’ s breast , a paw on either side of the babe ’ s mouth , the cat ’ s lips pressing those of the child and the infant ’ s face pale as that of a corpse , its lips with the blueness of death .” the doctor ’ s emphatic statements to the contrary , the legend is still a fatuous piece of lore . it turns up so often , however , that it ’ s no wonder the legend is so widely believed . <PARA> barbara “ catafalque for cat - at - fault ” mikkelson

false	origins : this april 2009 warning cautioned residents of the humble , texas , area to be aware that criminals were surreptitiously placing baskets underneath parked cars at the deerbrook mall , a ruse employed to lure shoppers into exiting their vehicles to <PARA> investigate the resultant noise — diverting their attention and leaving the driver ’ s seat of their automobiles unattended just long enough for the crafty thieves to make off with the cars or to rob drivers who have been gulled by this trick into leaving their vehicles . <PARA> it echoes other e - mailed advisories about the ill - intentioned using stratagems to get potential victims to leave their cars , such as the 2007 warning for shoppers to watch out for sharpened pipes or spikes laid up against their car tires in mall parking lots , and the 2002 alert about sugar being slipped into the gas tanks of cars belonging to female shoppers , in that it too features the deliberate crippling of the targets ’ vehicles to facilitate the intended crime . <PARA> regarding the 2009 alert about plastic baskets being affixed to the undersides of cars in the houston area , officials from both the deerbrook mall and humble police said no such incident was reported as having taken place at the mall : <PARA> “ this incident did not occur at deerbrook mall , nor are we aware of any similar situations happening in the past ,” said justin roche , general manager at deerbrook mall , who himself received some of the e - mails from concerned residents . “ the described conversation did not take place with any of our security officers .” <PARA> humble police lt . jay wrobliske agreed that no such incident was brought to the attention of police . <PARA> humble police lt . jay wrobliske agreed that no such incident was brought to the attention of police . <PARA> a correspondent who represented himself to us as the security guard referenced in this e - mailed warning stated that he did in fact see a couple of incidents involving something being dragged under cars at the deerbrook mall one day , but he did not report them to management because he had no reason to believe they were anything other than the result of drivers accidentally running over objects in the parking lot . also , contrary to the claims made in the e - mail , he maintained that he approached the driver of the second car and informed her that something was dragging under her vehicle ( rather than the other way around ), and that he did not tell her “ the basket was placed [ under her car ] on purpose ” by criminals with the intent of luring her out of her automobile .	
false	thanks to air travel and the failure of public health officials to control travel from mexico , the virus spread worldwide . despite predictions of massive numbers of deaths and the arrival of doomsday , the virus has remained a relatively mild disease , something we know happens each year with flu epidemics . <PARA> worldwide , there have only been 311 deaths out of 70 , 893 cases of swine flu . in the united states , 27 , 717 cases have resulted in 127 deaths . every death is a tragedy , but such a low death rate should not be the basis of a draconian government policy . <PARA> it is helpful to recall that the centers for disease control with the collusion of the media , constantly tell us that 36 , 000 people die from the flu each year , a figure that has been shown to be a lie . in this case , we are talking about 300 plus deaths for the entire world . <PARA> this virus continues to be an enigma for virologists . in the april 30 , 2009 issue of nature , a virologist was quoted as saying , “ where the hell it got all these genes from we don ’ t know .” extensive analysis of the virus found that it contained the original 1918 h1n1 flu virus , the avian flu virus ( bird flu ), and two new h3n2 virus genes from eurasia . debate continues over the possibility that swine flu is a genetically engineered virus . <PARA> naturally , vaccine manufacturers have been in a competitive battle to produce the first vaccine . the main contenders have been baxter pharmaceuticals and novartis pharmaceuticals , the latter of which recently acquired the scandal - ridden chiron vaccine company . both of these companies have had agreements with the world health organization to produce a pandemic vaccine . <PARA> the baxter vaccine , called celvapan , has had fast track approval . it uses a new vero cell technology , which utilizes cultured cells from the african green monkey . this same animal tissue transmits a number of vaccine - contaminating viruses , including the hiv virus . <PARA> the baxter company has been associated with two deadly scandals . the first event occurred in 2006 when hemophiliac components were contaminated with hiv virus and injected in tens of thousands of people , including thousands of children . baxter continued to release the hiv contaminated vaccine even after the contamination was known . <PARA> the second event occurred recently when it was discovered that baxter had released a seasonal flu vaccine containing the bird flu virus , which would have produced a real world <PARA> pandemic , to 18 countries . fortunately , astute lab workers in the czech republic discovered the deadly combination and blew the whistle before a worldwide disaster was unleashed . <PARA> despite these two deadly events , who maintains an agreement with baxter pharmaceuticals to produce the world ’ s pandemic vaccine . novartis , the second contender , also has an agreement with who for a pandemic vaccine . novartis appears to have won the contract , since their vaccine is near completion . what is terrifying is that these pandemic vaccines contain ingredients , called immune adjuvants that a number of studies have shown cause devastating autoimmune disorders , including rheumatoid arthritis , multiple sclerosis and lupus . <PARA> animal studies using this adjuvant have found them to be deadly . a study using 14 guinea pigs found that when they were injected with the special adjuvant , only one animal survived . a repeat of the study found the same deadly outcome . <PARA> so , what is this deadly ingredient ? it is called squalene , a type of oil . the chiron company , maker of the deadly anthrax vaccine , makes an adjuvant called mf - 59 which contains two main ingredients of concern — squalene and gp120 . a number of studies have shown that squalene can trigger all of the above - mentioned autoimmune diseases when injected . <PARA> the mf - 59 adjuvant has been used in several vaccines . these vaccines , including tetanus and diphtheria , are the same vaccines frequently associated with adverse reactions . <PARA> i reviewed a number of studies on this adjuvant and found something quite interesting . several studies done on human test subjects found mf - 59 to be a very safe immune adjuvant . but when i checked to see who did these studies , i found — to no surprise — that they were done by the novartis pharmaceutical company and chiron pharmaceutical company , which have merged . they were all published in “ prestigious ” medical journals . also , to no surprise , a great number of studies done by independent laboratories and research institutions all found a strong link between mf - 59 and autoimmune diseases . <PARA> squalene in vaccines has been strongly linked to the gulf war syndrome . on august 1991 , anthony principi , secretary of veterans affairs admitted that soldiers vaccinated with the anthrax vaccine from 1990 to 1991 had an increased risk of 200 percent in developing the deadly disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ), also called lou gehrig ’ s disease . the soldiers also suffered from a number of debilitating and life - shortening diseases , such as polyarteritis nodosa , multiple sclerosis ( ms ), lupus , transverse myelitis ( a neurological disorder caused by inflammation of the spinal cord ), endocarditis ( inflammation of the heart ’ s inner lining ), optic neuritis with blindness and glomerulonephritis ( a type of kidney disease ). <PARA> because squalene , the main ingredient in mf - 59 , can induce hyperimmune responses and induce autoimmunity , a real danger exists for prolonged activation of the brain ’ s immune cells , the microglia . this type of prolonged activation has been strongly associated with such diseases as multiple sclerosis , alzheimer ’ s disease , parkinson ’ s disease , als and possibly vaccine - related encephalitis . it has been shown that activation of the systemic immune system , as occurs with vaccination , rapidly activates the brain ’ s microglia at the same time , and this brain inflammation can persist for long periods . <PARA> so , how would the gp120 get into the brain ? studies of other immune adjuvants using careful tracer techniques have shown that they routinely enter the brain following vaccination . what most people do not know , even the doctors who recommend the vaccines , is that most such studies by pharmaceutical companies observe the patients for only one to two weeks following vaccination — these types of reactions may take months or even years to manifest . <PARA> it is obvious that the vaccine manufacturers stand to make billions of dollars in profits from this who / government - promoted pandemic . novartis , the maker of the new pandemic vaccine , recently announced that they would not give free vaccines to impoverished nations — everybody pays . <PARA> one must keep in mind that once the vaccine is injected , there is little you can do to protect yourself — at least by conventional medicine . it will mean a lifetime of crippling illness and early death . <PARA> there are much safer ways to protect oneself from this flu virus , such as higher doses of vitamin d3 , selective immune enhancement using supplements , and a good diet . <PARA> origins : squalene is natural organic compound produced by all higher organisms ( including human beings ). squalene is sometimes used as an adjuvant in vaccines — that is , an agent that stimulates the immune system and increases the response to a vaccine . the warning reproduced above cautions that the swine flu vaccine “ is one of the most dangerous vaccines ever devised ” because it uses squalene as an adjuvant , and vaccines containing squalene have been proved to cause severe autoimmune disorders . it is wrong on both counts . <PARA> the claim that vaccines containing squalene have been linked to severe autoimmune disorders is based on a study published in the journal experimental and molecular pathology in 2000 which found squalene antibodies in gulf war veterans who had received anthrax vaccines before being deployed . however , as noted by the world health organization ( who ), that study has been criticized as flawed for a number of reasons , not least of which is that the anthrax vaccines administered to the subjects of the study did not contain squalene : <PARA> a few people have tried to link the health problems of gulf war veterans to the possible presence of squalene in the vaccines these soldiers received . one published report suggested that some veterans who received anthrax vaccines developed anti - squalene antibodies and these antibodies caused disabilities . <PARA> it is now known that squalene was not added to the vaccines administered to these veterans , and technical deficiencies in the report suggesting an association have been published . most adults , whether or not they have received vaccines containing squalene , have antibodies against squalene . <PARA> it is now known that squalene was not added to the vaccines administered to these veterans , and technical deficiencies in the report suggesting an association have been published . most adults , whether or not they have received vaccines containing squalene , have antibodies against squalene . <PARA> in any case , the squalene issue is a moot point , because the flu vaccines being distributed in the u . s . do not contain squalene . there are currently no vaccines approved for use in the u . s . with a squalene adjuvant , and neither the current swine flu nor the seasonal flu vaccines has any adjuvant at all . a complete list of vaccines ( and their component ingredients ) licensed for immunization and distribution in the u . s . is available on the web site of the food and drug administration ( fda ), and it shows that none of the approved flu vaccines contain squalene .

( drug addicts have been using syringes and needles for decades — you have to wonder why they didn ’ t start leaving them in pepsi cans and pay phone coin slots until after aids came to world - wide attention .) we ’ re told that this isn ’ t a tale from some “ hearsay urban legend source ,” but rather from “ phone company workers , through the emt instructor .” in other words , the one and only source for this warning is an unnamed emt instructor somewhere who heard it from an unidentified telephone company workers somewhere . you can ’ t beat that as a reliable source ... <PARA> examples : <PARA> to date , there are no known instances of contaminated needles turning up in pay phone coin returns , let alone an unsuspecting telephone user ’ s being infected by one . “ we have been looking at all of our phones and have not found a single instance of where this has happened ,” bell atlantic spokesman cliff lee said in a november 1998 article in the buffalo news . a december 1998 article in the chicago tribune stated : <PARA> on 9 february 1999 two people were injured in pulaski , virginia , when they put their fingers into the coin return slots of pay telephones and were jabbed by ( uncontaminated ) needles left in those slots . the next day , four hypodermic needles were found — wrapped in cotton , thus not presenting much of a danger to anyone — in post office mail slots and a night deposit box in nearby wythe county . no one was infected or seriously injured in those incidents . <PARA> did the legend come true ? we doubt it . you see , six days earlier the major newspaper of that area carried an article about this very legend , exposing it as a hoax . most likely a prankster or two read it and decided to pull some legs . <PARA> on 29 october 2009 a student at middle state tennessee university was stuck by a hypodermic needle after reaching into the change dispenser of a pepsi machine located on campus . she was treated at middle tennessee medical center and later released . police are examining the syringe . a second syringe was discovered on 4 november 2009 in a “ vitamin water ” vending machine at that college ’ s student center . no one was injured in that incident . <PARA> in 2000 , some thoughtful soul re - worked the original scare about coin returns on pay phones into one focused on a variety of vending machines and set it in canada : <PARA> despite the forceful claims made in this later version of the “ aids needle found in coin return ” scare , there have not been any such incidents in edmonton , calgary , or any other canadian cities . moreover , officials of the university of lethbridge ( alberta ) have been bedeviled by inquiries about this story since it first appeared on the internet . all who have asked have been told the same thing : there haven ’ t been any such attacks on their campus .

false	our fascination for associating wholesome , innocent icons of popular culture with hidden depravities and unsavory backgrounds seemingly knows no bounds . thus we have tales that nature - loving pop singer john denver was a vietnam - era sniper , that genial children ’ s tv host fred rogers served as a navy seal , that the actor who portrayed geeky paul pfeiffer on tv ’ s popular the wonder years grew up to become shock rocker marilyn manson , and that the host of nickelodeon ’ s preschooler favorite blue ’ s clues died of a drug overdose . <PARA> as the epitomical producer of popular children ’ s fare , disney comes in for more than its fair share of such rumors : scandalous tales about both walt disney himself ( e . g ., that he was booted out of the military , that he was a nazi sympathizer , that he was an illegitimate child ) and many of the films produced by the company he founded . <PARA> a common motif among disney legends is the claim that various disney animated films were drug - inspired ; that disney and his band of animators were users of hallucinogens such as lsd , and their experiences with drugs formed the basis for such fare as the fantasy world of snow white and the seven dwarfs , the colorful visual interpretation of musical themes in fantasia , and the surreal psychedelia of alice in wonderland . <PARA> on a literal level , not much can be said to address these rumors other than to cite a litany of negative evidence . walt disney and his principal animators are well - known figures about whom much has been written , and no one who knew or worked with them claimed ( or even suggested ) that they partook of recreational drugs . and although drug abuse was enough of a social concern to prompt didactic scare films such as reefer madness and the cocaine fiends back in the 1930s , the “ drug ” of choice in walt disney ’ s era was far more likely to have been alcohol than anything else . ( recall that the hallucinatory “ pink elephants on parade ” sequence in 1941 ’ s dumbo is triggered when the diminutive pachyderm inadvertently imbibes a tubful of champagne .) <PARA> as for lsd , it wasn ’ t even brought to the usa until 1949 , too late to have been the driving force behind disney ’ s classic animated films ( although alternative hallucinogens such as mescaline were certainly obtainable .) of the notion that the imagination displayed in disney ’ s animated films was drug - induced , animator art babbitt , who drew the dancing mushrooms in “ the nutcracker suite ” portion of fantasia , sarcastically quipped : “ yes , it is true . i myself was addicted to ex - lax and feenamint .” <PARA> drug rumors were undoubtedly fueled because fantasia and alice in wonderland received mixed reviews upon their initial releases , and neither was much of a financial success until their re - releases ( and availability as rental films ) in the late 1960s and early 1970s drew crowds of college students who found the films ’ melding of color , light , music , and imagery made them ideal psychedelic “ head ” flicks . so much so , in fact , that disney ’ s marketing began to pitch these films to such audiences : <PARA> also of significance is that all the plot aspects of alice in wonderland which “ suggest drugs ” were present in lewis carroll ’ s original work , and disney merely adapted them for the screen . <PARA> as for the original example , walt disney didn ’ t “ invent ” snow white , of course — the film was based on the european version of that fairy tale as collected by the grimm brothers over a century earlier . disney did flesh the story out to feature film length , though , and he was the one who created names and distinctive personalities for each of the seven dwarfs . but the suggestion that the dwarfs ’ names correspond ( intentionally or otherwise ) to the symptoms of various stages of cocaine addiction is bunk . cocaine addiction might be considered to have identifiable stages , but no standard set of physical symptoms accompanies each stage . many types of drug abuse ( and physical or mental illnesses ) can produce symptoms such as changes in sleep / wake patterns ( sleepy ), mood swings ( happy , grumpy ), alteration of personality ( dopey , bashful ), and allergies ( sneezy ) — eventually necessitating a trip to the doc .

false	origins : on <PARA> 23 may 2000 , the seattle post - intelligencer published an article announcing the discovery of asbestos in certain brands of children ’ s crayons ; specifically , crayola , prang , and rose art . this accusation sparked a firestorm of debate , with the seattle post - intelligencer standing by the findings of its independent lab analysis , and binney & smith ( manufacturer of crayola ) maintaining that the independent analysis it had commissioned turned up no such thing . <PARA> the article that kicked off this controversy claimed asbestos had been found in three of the eight brands ( crayola , prang , and rose art ) that it checked for the presence of this carcinogen . of the 40 crayons tested from those three brands , 80 % were contaminated above the trace level . <PARA> binney & smith asserted the results must have been interpreted wrongly and that it had been common in the past for some labs to misidentify talc fibres as asbestos . the art and creative materials institute ( a trade association paid to certify such materials as non - toxic ) insisted the results must be wrong . “ there is no asbestos in crayons ,” said debbie fanning , the institute ’ s executive <PARA> director . <PARA> on 12 june 2000 , the consumer product safety commission ( cspc ) released the results of its tests . the cpsc found “ a trace amount of asbestos in two crayola crayons made by binney and smith and one prang crayon made by dixon ticonderoga ” but stated that “ the amount of asbestos is so small it is scientifically insignificant .” <PARA> in crayola crayons and prang crayons , cpsc also found larger amounts of another fiber , called “ transitional ” fiber , which is similar in appearance to asbestos fiber . while there are potential concerns about these fibers if children are exposed to them , cpsc tests concluded that the ingestion risk to children through either inhalation or ingestion is extremely low and there is no scientific basis for a recall . <PARA> as vital the question of asbestos in crayons is , another question eclipses it : if it were there , would it do any harm ? asbestos is not a deadly poison , the mere touch of which will prove fatal — it ’ s a cancer - causing agent that can prove deadly if it ’ s breathed in . according to the u . s . environmental protection agency ( epa ): <PARA> asbestos is the name for a group of naturally occurring minerals that separate into strong , very fine fibers . the fibers are heat - resistant and extremely durable , and , because of these qualities , asbestos has become very useful in construction and industry . in the home it may or may not pose a health hazard to the occupants , depending on its condition . when it can be crushed by hand pressure or the surface is not sealed , to prevent small pieces from escaping , the material is considered friable . in this condition fibers can be released and pose a health risk . however , as long as the surface is stable and well - sealed against the release of its fibers and not damaged , the material is considered safe until damaged in some way . <PARA> asbestos is only dangerous when it ’ s deteriorated to the point where its tiny fibers can be released into the air and inhaled . if the material is solid ( in appearance and to touch ) and maintained in good condition , it presents no problem . <PARA> asbestos is only dangerous when it ’ s deteriorated to the point where its tiny fibers can be released into the air and inhaled . if the material is solid ( in appearance and to touch ) and maintained in good condition , it presents no problem . <PARA> if trace amounts of asbestos were encased in a waxy substance such as crayons , those fibers would not be friable and would pose no risk of becoming airborne . <PARA> what ’ s a parent to do ? listen to the consumer products safety commission . according to that august body , the risk of exposure to the fibers from using crayons is low . in a simulation of a child vigorously coloring with a crayon for half an hour , no fibers were found in the air . the risk of exposure by eating crayons is also low because the fibers are imbedded in wax and pass through a child ’ s body . however , cpsc concluded that these fibers should not continue to be used in children ’ s crayons in the long term . <PARA> cpsc tests concluded that there is no cause for concern . parents and teachers can continue to use the crayons they have and purchase crayons from store shelves . <PARA> the cpsc has asked industry to reformulate crayons using substitute ingredients . binney and smith and dixon ticonderoga quickly volunteered to reformulate within a year to eliminate the fibers . rose art , which has only a small percentage of crayons made with talc , also agreed to reformulate . <PARA> barbara “ the truth , asbestos i can figure out ” mikkelson	
true	origins : this e - mailed alert began circulating on the internet in march 2007 . while we don ’ t yet know the specific product referenced in the letter ( the manufacturer wasn ’ t named ), there was indeed a <PARA> recall of certain brands of sidewalk chalk in 2003 because they were found to contain excessive amounts of lead . <PARA> in 2003 , voluntary recalls were issued by both target and toys r us for the “ double dipp ’ n fun ” brand of sidewalk chalk then being vended by both retailers . produced in china , the triangular chalk sticks were multicolored and sold for about 99 cents per package . some 26 , 000 units were sold nationwide between march and july 2003 . <PARA> given that there does not appear to be a current consumer products and safety commission alert about sidewalk chalk , there is reason to believe the march 2007 e - mail about lead being found in that type of product refers to the 2003 incident . indeed , the letter ’ s “ both of my children tested positive for lead exposure a few years ago . we had everything tested and it turned out to be sidewalk chalk ” tends to indicate the product in question was the “ double dipp ’ n fun ” brand that was subsequently recalled . <PARA> as to why this matter is of note , while exposure to lead presents a hazard to all , it poses an especial danger to children . additional care must be taken to limit their exposure to it . <PARA> lead poisoning can reportedly lower intelligence , cause mental retardation , memory problems , depression , fatigue , hyperactivity , aggression , hearing loss , liver or kidney damage , osteoporosis , high blood pressure and anemia . very high levels can damage the nervous system , kidneys and major organs and even result in seizures or death . it can also lead to infertility in men and cause spontaneous abortion in women . in the final stages of lead poisoning , the victim experiences convulsions , paralysis , blindness , delusions , and then coma . people can and have died of lead <PARA> poisoning . <PARA> in times long past , lead was to be found in numerous everyday items , including cisterns and aquaducts , pottery , pans , hair dyes , cosmetics , and medical nostrums . toy soldiers were cast in it . port wine was protected by it . church roofs were covered with it . the presence of lead in everyday life has since been considerably reduced and our bodies are far less riddled with this deadly substance than were those of our ancestors , but this element will likely always be part of our surroundings and of us . <PARA> the two major sources of lead poisoning in the united states have been lead - based paint , which was restricted in 1978 , and leaded gasoline , which was phased out in the early 1990s . however , lead is still found in paint manufactured before 1978 , in soil and dust ( particularly next to busy roads or factories ), in some imported or handmade pottery and tableware , and in imported home remedies and cosmetics . <PARA> yet most of the lead we take in comes from our diet . “ the average daily diet probably contains more than 200 micrograms of lead , of which about 10 micrograms gets into the blood , where it is joined by about 5 micrograms of lead from our lungs ( depending upon where we live ), so that our daily intake probably comes to about 15 micrograms and the body can easily rid itself of such an amount ,” says john emsley . lead finds its way into the food chain because all plants contain some lead , although not very much . <PARA> because lead is a naturally - occurring element found in the soil , it does manage to get into things . care therefore has to be taken by manufacturers to detect its presence in goods destined for consumer use . various lead - laden gewgaws and foodstuffs do arrive on the market , however , especially among goods produced in other parts of the world and imported to the u . s . in 2004 , california ’ s attorney general sued dozens of companies that make or sell imported candies containing lead , and in 2005 the california department of health services urged consumers to stay away from candy produced in mexico that contained tamarind or chili powder after tests found possible lead contamination in those edibles . in 1994 an outbreak of lead poisoning in hungary was traced to the use of that element by an unscrupulous or unknowing manufacturer as a colorant in paprika . <PARA> barbara “ get the lead out ” mikkelson	
true	origins : from the “ good ideas that didn ’ t work out as expected ” department : <PARA> in 1988 the los angeles lakers basketball team , led by head coach pat riley , had won back - to - back nba <PARA> championships and were poised to become the first team to clinch three straight nba titles since the boston celtics reeled off an astounding string of eight consecutive championship victories from 1959 to 1966 . byron scott , who at the time was a member of riley ’ s lakers team ( and is now the head coach of the new jersey nets ), came up with the catchy term “ three - peat ” to describe the feat the lakers were hoping to accomplish . <PARA> when a friend suggested at dinner one evening that riley trademark the term , he acted on the advice and submitted a trademark application for “ three - peat ” on 7 november 1988 through his riles & co . business concern . riley ’ s registering of the trademark didn ’ t mean that anyone who uttered or printed the word “ three - peat ” had to send money to him , but it did grant him exclusive commercial use of “ three - peat ” on shirts , jackets , and <PARA> hats — anyone who wished to manufacture and sell those items of clothing had to obtain a license from riles & co . in order to print “ three - peat ” on them . <PARA> the anticipated surge in sales of “ three - peat ” items failed to materialize as anticipated when the lakers were swept in the 1989 nba finals by the detroit pistons . the profits were merely delayed for a few years , however , as the chicago bulls ( with the phenomenal michael jordan ) pulled off a “ three - peat ” by taking three straight nba crowns from 1991 to 1993 . riles & co . then filed two more applications to register the term for use on collector plates , mugs , tankards , non - metal key chains , and plaques , putting them in good position to capitalize on the bulls ’ second string of three consecutive nba titles between 1996 and 1998 . <PARA> although riley left the los angeles lakers after the 1989 - 90 season ( he ’ s currently the head coach of the miami heat ), he ’ ll undoubtedly be warmed — if only in a financial sense — by the thought that the lakers finally managed to claim that elusive third straight nba title in 2002 . <PARA> and in case you ’ re thinking about it . . . the significantly less catchy “ four - peat ” has already been trademarked for a plethora of uses , so there are no quick bucks to be made there .	
true	journalist charley reese ( now retired ) was part of the orlando sentinel ‘ s staff for three decades between 1971 - 2001 , during which time he ( among other duties ) penned a thrice - weekly column which was distributed to other newspapers nationwide by king features syndicate . during the 1980s reese wrote the first version of an editorial opining that 545 people ( i . e ., the president of the united states , plus all the members of congress and the supreme court ) “ are directly , legally , morally and individually responsible for the domestic problems that plague this country ,” and he has amended , updated , and republished that piece several times since then . <PARA> the following version is taken from the 7 march 1995 edition of the orlando sentinel , where it ran under the title “ looking for someone to blame ? congress is a good place to start ”: <PARA> by way of comparison , here is another version of reese ’ s piece , as it appeared in 1985 : <PARA> in 2008 , reese ’ s editorial was updated with some topical political references ( e . g ., nancy pelosi ’ s name in place of tip o ’ neill ’ s ; the army and marines listed as being in iraq rather than on “ u . n . missions ”) and circulated via e - mail under the title “ the 545 people responsible for america ’ s woes ” ( or just “ 545 people ), often with additional material not written by reese himself tacked onto the beginning or end of the article . <PARA> reese died on 21 may 2013 . he wrote his actual final column in august 2008 :

true	origins : many who find solace in spirituals find an additional measure of satisfaction in discovering that cherished songs were penned by folks possessed of colorful histories . songs celebrating the mercy of god seem to mean more when they issue from reformed sinners , so stories that play up that aspect of a song ’ s history are especially prized , even if key points are embellished . <PARA> as was the case with “ amazing grace ,” though it is well grounded in fact , the history of “ it is no secret ( what god can do )” has been exaggerated at some points to make for better telling . <PARA> carl stuart hamblen ( the e - mailed account misidentifies him as russ hamblin ) composed and recorded “ it is no secret ” in 1950 . born in texas in 1908 , hamblen enjoyed a long and successful musical career as a singer / songwriter , with more than two hundred songs to his credit , before he passed away in california in 1989 . hamblen was a heavy drinker who swore off demon rum and made religion a central part of his life in 1949 after attending “ youth for christ ,” a historic revival meeting held by the reverend dr . billy graham in los angeles . <PARA> various biographies of both hamblen and graham support the claim of the songwriter ’ s having gone to dr . graham ’ s hotel room and insisted he be prayed for . according to grady wilson , a lifelong friend and associate of billy graham , after attending the revival meeting earlier that night coming away from it troubled , hamblen and his wife did pay a call on dr . graham at the langham hotel , one block off wilshire boulevard , at 4 a . m ., asking to be saved . wilson reports the singer was “ broken up and crying as billy said , ‘ we ’ ve been praying for you for weeks .'” <PARA> hamblen ’ s daughter , lisa hamblen jaserie , also supports the tale of the “ dark of the night ” conversion . <PARA> john wayne ’ s connection to the song does appear to be well established . according to stuart hamblen ( and if anyone would know , it would be him ) he did indeed gain his inspiration for “ it is no secret ” from a response he made to the movie star . hamblen did appear in a number of minor westerns , including some that starred the duke , so they knew each other , at least casually . the inspiration came from a brief conversation at a party : in reply to wayne ’ s comment “ what ’ s this i hear — you got religion ?,” stuart answered , “ it is no secret what god can do in a man ’ s life .” the movie star then reportedly drawled , “ well that sounds like a song ,” thereby planting the idea in the songwriter ’ s mind . <PARA> yet not all the claims made in the e - mailed version of the song ’ s history hold up . this one , for instance , is clearly false : <PARA> and along came a young preacher holding a tent revival . hamblin had him on his radio show , presumably to poke fun at him . and to gather more material , hamblin showed up at one of the revival meetings . <PARA> according to dr . graham , he went on stuart hamblen ’ s radio show as part of a media push to raise interest in advance of the revival meeting . he and the other organizers of the event were having trouble getting any advance press coverage , so his appearance on hamblen ’ s show was a boon to them . and rather than poking fun at the reverend , hamblen told his listeners to “ go on down to billy graham ’ s tent and hear the preaching .” <PARA> another aspect of this e - mailed account rings false : it is inaccurate to say of hamblen that “ hard times were upon him ” after his spiritual awakening . a year after his discovery of the lord , hamblen wrote “ it is no secret ,” a tune that brought him tremendous <PARA> acclaim as it became the first cross - over gospel , country , and pop ballad , reaching the number one spot on all three charts . that same year , he wrote “ remember me , i ’ m the one who loves you ,” a song which peaked at # 2 on the gospel and country charts and held that position for a full nine weeks . as for “ this ole house ,” supposedly the sole bright spot in hamblen ’ s career during a period of professional reverses between his conversion and the success of “ it is no secret ,” he didn ’ t write that song until 1954 , four years after he ’ d topped the charts with “ it is no secret .” (“ this ole house ” shouldn ’ t be dismissively described as “ the only one that had much success ” — it went to # 2 in the country field and stayed on the charts for thirty weeks , while rosemary clooney ’ s version went to # 3 in the pop charts and was named song of the year .) <PARA> in the early 1950s hamblen did lose his radio show , the cowboy church of the air , over his refusal to do a commercial promoting alcohol , but his principled stand led the prohibition party to nominate him as their candidate for president of the united states in 1952 . hamblen racked up nearly 73 , 000 votes and finished fourth in a field of twelve candidates despite appearing on the ballot in only twenty - one states . <PARA> barbara “ gospel ” mikkelson	
true	as i begin to write this , i “ slug ” it , as we writers say , which means i put a heading on top of the document to identify it . this heading is “ eonlinefinal ,” and it gives me a shiver to write it . i have been doing this column for so long that i cannot even recall when i started . <PARA> i loved writing this column so much for so long i came to believe it would never end . lew harris , who founded this great site , asked me to do it maybe seven or eight years ago , and i loved writing this column so much for so long i came to believe it would never end . <PARA> but again , all things must pass , and my column for e ! online must pass . in a way , it is actually the perfect time for it to pass . lew , whom i have known forever , was impressed that i knew so many stars at morton ’ s on monday nights . <PARA> he could not get over it , in fact . so , he said i should write a column about the stars i saw at morton ’ s and what they had to say . <PARA> [ . . .] <PARA> but morton ’ s is not the star galaxy it once was , though it probably will be again . <PARA> beyond that , a bigger change has happened . i no longer think hollywood stars are terribly important . they are uniformly pleasant , friendly people , and they treat me better than i deserve to be treated . but a man or woman who makes a huge wage for memorizing lines and reciting them in front of a camera is no longer my idea of a shining star we should all look up to . <PARA> a real star is the soldier of the 4th infantry division who poked his head into a hole on a farm near tikrit , iraq . how can a man or woman who makes an eight - figure wage and lives in insane luxury really be a star in today ’ s world , if by a “ star ” we mean someone bright and powerful and attractive as a role model ? <PARA> [ rest of article here ] <PARA> origins : ben <PARA> stein , a lawyer by training , has also served as a speechwriter for president richard m . nixon , has to date authored sixteen books ( both novels and non - fiction efforts ), and continues to write editorials and columns for a number of prominent publications . he is perhaps best known to the world at large , however , for his in - front - of - the - camera work as the dreadfully dull economics teacher in the film ferris bueller ’ s day off ( and his similar role as the monotonic science teacher mr . cantwell on the tv series the wonder years ) and as the keenly competitive host of the comedy central game show win ben stein ’ s money . <PARA> for several years ( through the end of 2003 ), mr . stein penned a regular column for e ! online , and the excerpt quoted above is taken from his final <PARA> piece for that venue , published on 20 december 2003 . he seized the occasion of his last column to muse on the nature of stardom , asking “ how can someone who lives in insane luxury be a star in today ’ s world ?” and questioning whether actors and actresses who make huge sums of money and live in luxury should truly be considered “ stars ” or “ heroes ” in the modern era , especially in comparison to the “ noncoms and officers who barely scrape by on military pay but stand on guard in afghanistan and iraq and on ships and in submarines and near the arctic circle [ and ] are anonymous as they live and die .” <PARA> mr . stein ’ s column evidently struck a chord with a good many readers , as it continues to be circulated widely via e - mail forwarding several years after its original publication . <PARA> ben stein biography

true	origins : changes that have made the use of e - mail a standard method of business communication for everything from official correspondence to informal messages means that one can no longer <PARA> assume personal correspondence will remain private . workplace chat that might once have been exchanged through face - to - face communications or handwritten notes is now tackled via e - mail , a form in which — thanks to the internet — it can be blasted to thousands of eavesdroppers with a few clicks of a mouse . <PARA> such was the case with an interoffice spat between jenny amner , a secretary at the london office of international law firm baker & mckenzie , and 36 - year - old richard phillips , a senior associate at the same firm . in june 2005 a brief e - mail exchange between the two made the news when it was leaked outside the firm , and ( perhaps as was intended ) momentarily turned mr . phillips into a figure of derision around <PARA> london . <PARA> the information provided in the initial e - mail merely records that on 25 may 2005 , mr . phillips e - mailed ms . amner , informed her that it would cost £ 4 to remove the ketchup stains from his trousers , and asked her to provide him with the cash by the <PARA> end of the day . we can infer from this that ms . amner was presumably somehow responsible for the creation of those ketchup stains . nine days later , ms . amner finally responded to the request , and we can likewise infer from her caustic reply that she was none too pleased about being asked by a senior associate to cover a £ 4 cleaning bill , as she sarcastically apologized to mr . phillips for allowing the recent illness and death of her mother to take precedence and announced that since he was evidently in desperate need of the money , her office mates had offered to take up a collection to raise it amongst themselves . ( according to various news sources , mr . phillips earned between £ 80 , 000 to £ 150 , 000 a year , while ms . amner ’ s salary was about £ 25 , 000 .) <PARA> the exchange was circulated widely on the internet and reported on by nearly all the major english - language news services commonly known by three - letter initialisms ( e . g ., cnn , bbc , cbc , afp ), prompting the agence france presse to note that mr . phillips was “ on the verge of becoming a public hate figure ... after appear [ ing ] to show appalling meanness .” the times stated that ms . amner , “ a slim bespectacled blonde in her 50s , looked embarrassed and declined to comment , directing all enquiries to baker & mckenzie ,” but a spokesperson for the latter would not comment on any specifics , telling the press only that : <PARA> we confirm we are aware of the incident and subsequent e - mail exchange . <PARA> this is a private matter between two members of staff that clearly got out of hand . we are investigating so as to resolve it as amicably as we can . <PARA> as i am sure you understand we respect the privacy of our staff and make it a policy not to comment on individuals to the media . <PARA> this is a private matter between two members of staff that clearly got out of hand . we are investigating so as to resolve it as amicably as we can . <PARA> as i am sure you understand we respect the privacy of our staff and make it a policy not to comment on individuals to the media . <PARA> a baker & mckenzie staff member told the times that ms . amner had “ copied [ her message ] to the whole floor and everyone was in stitches . she had come into work this morning to find a post - it chasing her for the £ 4 after having the funeral the day before . he ’ s so tight .” ( how ms . amner managed to spill or splash ketchup onto a senior associate ’ s trousers remains a mystery .) <PARA> a few days after the “ ketchup trousers ” story broke , the daily telegraph reported that richard phillips was “ devastated at his public humiliation ” and was resigning his position , although a baker & mckenzie spokesperson maintained that mr . phillips had already made his decision to leave the firm “ long before ” the e - mail incident took place and had submitted his resignation before the issue became public . the telegraph noted that “ ms . amner is also understood to be considering her future with the company after being made to feel isolated by colleagues who believe mr . phillips was unfairly victimised ” and that both parties “ have been given leave from work until the email row blows over .”	
false	examples : [ collected via e - mail , 2005 ] <PARA> about two weeks ago friends of the mcgarveys went to take a gentleman , who had just returned from serving our country in iraq , out to eat at shady maple . this gentleman ( i apologize for not knowing his name ) proudly wore his military uniform to shady maple . shady maple said they would not serve the man in the military uniform . they said they absolutely will not serve soldiers . these friends were angered and in shock at what was happening . they went through the restauraunt telling other customers what was happening . most of the customers got up and walked out of the restaurant not finishing their meals . <PARA> being a former employee of shady , i know that they and the owner of good ’ s do not believe in war and fighting . we were told this is part of the reason they do not sell the american flag . i suppose that is okay , but i never thought this meant that they would refuse service to a man or woman who has put their life on the line for our country and others . <PARA> after all , isn ’ t it because of those that died fighting for our freedom that the owners of both stores are able to believe in what they want to freely ?? <PARA> tom and i have decided that we will no longer be eating out at the smorgasbord . we are very saddened at what they have done . <PARA> thank you for reading this . <PARA> it has been all over the local talk radio shows in the reading area for the last two days that a father took both of his sons , who are in the service and were in uniform , to the shady maple smorgesborg to eat . shady maple refused to serve them because they were in uniform . apparently , the owners of shady maple , due to their religious beliefs , do not believe in military service or war and therefore choose not to render service to those in uniform . the local veteran groups and other concerned citizens are asking every one to not buy anything from shady maple . this includes the resturants , the grocery store and anything else that they are involved in . since a major portion of shady ’ s business comes from people who travel from the philadelphia area and other areas , they are asking that you tell as many people as possible about this discrimination . this incident , is not the first time they have refused to serve our men and women in uniform . <PARA> origins : the rise in appreciation of the military in recent years has served to speed along a number of “ outrage ” e - mail forwards which call for a boycott of a particular restaurant , bar , gas station , or other retail establishment said to have refused service to someone wearing a u . s . armed forces uniform . previous targets of such outrage include : a <PARA> marathon gas station in pontiac , illinois ; a dunkin ’ donuts franchise in crown point , indiana ; restaurants in hilton head , south carolina , and duluth , minnesota ; and a shell gas station in tennessee . <PARA> while such tales of wrongs done to those who guard our freedoms do stir the blood , virtually all such reports we have encountered have proved to be either completely fabricated or highly distorted versions of real events . ( one exception , however , had to do with a 2004 incident at a convenience store in fort worth , texas .) <PARA> in the summer of 2005 , shady maple farm market , a combination grocery store and restaurant near lancaster , pennsylvania , became the target of a baseless “ shunned serviceman ” rumor . according to the story , shady maple turned away a serviceman just returned from iraq who tried to get seated while wearing his uniform . “ they said they absolutely will not serve soldiers ,” said the e - mail , because the owners “ do not believe in war and fighting .” <PARA> that incident never occurred . as to what might prompt folks to believe that it had , many of the restaurant and market ’ s staff are mennonites , a religion that advocates non - violence . the staffers ’ beliefs , however , do not affect who shady maple will and will not serve , as confirmed by elwood martin , the operations manager of shady maple : <PARA> we never deny anyone an opportunity to eat here . are you kidding ? that ’ s our livelihood , it ’ s our business and we encourage all to come in . <PARA> to this day , no one knows who wrote the e - mail or why , but its effects continue to be felt . the slander resurfaces each year around memorial day and veterans day , leaving shady maple to deal with the outrage anew . <PARA> shady maple was besieged by similar rumors in 1991 , during the first gulf war . at that time , the restaurant came under fire for supposedly refusing to serve customers wearing yellow ribbons in support of the military . that tale was also untrue . <PARA> barbara “ shady lain to rest ” mikkelson

unproven	the neighbors , puzzlingly , told them just to go to bed for now and not to notify the police right away . they would make a few phone calls and see what could be done . <PARA> the couple woke up the next morning to find all of their missing property piled neatly on the front porch . <PARA> origins : folklorist jan brunvand wrote about this legend in 1986 , having by then collected numerous variations of it , so it is clear that even by the mid - 1980s , the tale was a well - traveled one . in some tellings , it is the couple ’ s car that has <PARA> been stolen , in others their home has been burglarized . likewise , sometimes the helpful mafioso lives next door to them , sometimes he lives a few blocks away . <PARA> in each of the tellings , the couple is not unaware of the mobster ’ s identity : they are either flat - out certain that he is in the mob , or they have heard rumors to that effect . in no case , however , do they turn up on his doorstep lacking an inkling of the nature of the person they are talking to . as for the wiseguy ’ s potential motivation ( other than ordinary helpfulness ) for assisting folks relatively unknown to him , versions of the legend often stress his reluctance to have police called into his neighborhood . <PARA> in a related tale , a mobbed - up patient or client offers to pay his doctor or lawyer in services ( of the ‘ terminating a problem ’ variety ) rather than specie . the offer might be flatly declined or jokingly accepted in a “ aw , just break his legs ” way by the healthcare or legal professional , but nevertheless the sawbones or shark is subsequently floored to hear that the assault has been carried out . <PARA> as to what to make of the returned car or household goods yarn , the most common possible interpretation positions the mobster as having acted purely out of his sense of compassion for the couple that had been robbed . under this construct , the “ helpful mafia neighbor ” legend trumpets a message of there being good to be found in everyone , including the horrifically bad . however , in light of that message , it ’ s worth noting the mobster ’ s altruistic act is accomplished by his uncorking his intrinsic evil upon someone else — the purloined vehicle <PARA> or household goods reappear via the expedient of his tracking down their takers and intimidating them into surrendering the items . even when he tries to do good , in other words , he can ’ t help but do bad . <PARA> less common is the view that the mobbed - up guy acted only because he wanted to keep police from snooping around his neighborhood and questioning folks who live near him . unadulterated self - interest guides his hand , not any momentary impulse of kindness . <PARA> the second interpretation is borne out by the related tale in which the wiseguy settles his legal or medical bill with a violent act committed upon one of the professional man ’ s enemies rather than by paying cash — he substitutes something of little cost to him ( harm visited upon another ) for something of value he does hold dear ( money ). <PARA> barbara “ guardian angles ” mikkelson <PARA> sightings : in an episode of the television series the sopranos (“ 46 long ,” original air date 17 january 1999 ), tony orders some of his crew to locate a car stolen from his son ’ s science teacher and return it to him .

mixture	executive summary – the usa state of montana has signed into power a revolutionary gun law . i mean revolutionary . the state of montana has defied the federal government and their gun laws . this will prompt a <PARA> showdown between the federal government and the state of montana . the federal government fears citizens owning guns . they try to curtail what types of guns they can own . the gun control laws all have one common goal – confiscation of privately owned firearms . <PARA> montana has gone beyond drawing a line in the sand . they have challenged the federal government . the fed now either takes them on and risks them saying the federal agents have no right to violate their state gun laws <PARA> and arrest the federal agents that try to enforce the federal firearms acts . this will be a world - class event to watch . montana could go to voting for secession from the union , which is really throwing the gauntlet in obama ’ s face . if the federal government does nothing they lose face . gotta love it . <PARA> important points – if guns and ammunition are manufactured inside the state of montana for sale and use inside that state then the federal firearms laws have no applicability since the federal government only has the power to control commerce across state lines . montana has the law on their side . since when did the usa start following their own laws <PARA> especially the constitution of the usa , the very document that empowers the usa . <PARA> silencers made in montana and sold in montana would be fully legal and not registered . as a note silencers were first used before the 007 movies as a device to enable one to hunt without disturbing neighbors and scaring game . they were also useful as devices to control noise when practicing so as to not disturb the neighbors . <PARA> silencers work best with a bolt - action rifle . there is a long barrel and the chamber is closed tight so as to direct all the gases though the silencer at the tip of the barrel . semi - auto pistols and revolvers do not really muffle the sound very well except on the silver screen . the revolvers bleed gas out with the sound all over the place . the semi - auto pistols bleed the gases out when the slide recoils back . silencers are maybe nice for snipers picking off enemy soldiers even though they reduce velocity but not very practical for hit men shooting pistols in crowded places . silencers were useful tools for gun enthusiasts and hunters . <PARA> there would be no firearm registration , serial numbers , criminal records check , waiting periods or paperwork required . so in a short period of time there would be millions and millions of unregistered untraceable guns in montana . way to go montana ! <PARA> discussion – let us see what obama does . if he hits montana hard they will probably vote to secede from the usa . the governor of texas has already been refusing federal money because he does not want to agree to the conditions that go with it and he has been saying secession is a right they have as sort of a threat . things are no longer the same with the usa . do not be deceived by obama acting as if all is the same , it is not . <PARA> origins : in april 2009 , the state of montana enacted the montana firearms freedom act , legislation stating that “ a personal firearm , a firearm accessory , or ammunition that is manufactured commercially or privately in montana and that remains within the borders of montana is not subject to federal law or federal regulation , including registration , under the authority of congress to regulate interstate commerce ,” essentially a declaration that the u . s . federal government has no authority to regulate any firearms manufactured , sold , and owned within the state of montana . <PARA> montana has said , in effect , that the authority of congress to regulate interstate commerce does not give congress the authority to regulate firearms in montana that have not been involved in any form of interstate commerce . however , state legislatures do not have the authority to interpret or nullify u . s . supreme court decisions regarding federal constitutional powers , so any attempt by montana to enforce the firearms freedom act would likely be struck down by the u . s . supreme court as unconstitutional .

( they merely offer coupons for discounts on glasses , contacts , and premium lenses .) <PARA> so , we contacted target ’ s customer relations department to ask about this promotion and were told that they were offering such a deal , but only in a very limited sense . the “ free eyeglasses to children 12 and under ” promotion was a pilot program currently available only in a few stores in select areas ( e . g ., kansas city , kansas ). however , that pilot program has now ended , as a target optical marketing manager communicated to us on 10 april 2009 : <PARA> free kids eyeglasses promotion <PARA> at target optical , we believe strongly in our value , product and services and wanted to introduce target shoppers to the unique shopping experience <PARA> that we offer . so , to introduce more target shoppers to our stores , during the month of march we offered families a way to try target optical <PARA> for free through our free kids eyeglasses promotion . <PARA> the free kids eyeglasses promotion is now over . it was a limited time offer in seven stores within the greater kansas city area . we were pleased <PARA> to distribute over 1 , 000 pairs of free children ’ s eyeglasses during this event . <PARA> at target optical , we believe strongly in our value , product and services and wanted to introduce target shoppers to the unique shopping experience <PARA> that we offer . so , to introduce more target shoppers to our stores , during the month of march we offered families a way to try target optical <PARA> for free through our free kids eyeglasses promotion . <PARA> the free kids eyeglasses promotion is now over . it was a limited time offer in seven stores within the greater kansas city area . we were pleased <PARA> to distribute over 1 , 000 pairs of free children ’ s eyeglasses during this event .

( paul harvey , for example , mentioned it during his noontime broadcast on 6 july 1999 .) oddly enough , conservative columnist cal thomas maintained that the story was indeed true , only it had to do with president george h . w . bush ( father of george w . bush ): <PARA> bush said it in my presence at a religious broadcasters convention about 1990 , and i wrote about it in my book , blinded by might : can the religious right save america . but somehow it got twisted around and stuck on the internet and put in al gore ’ s mouth . he ’ s got a lot of stuff that he has to defend , but that ’ s not one of them . <PARA> the relevant passage in thomas ’ book reads as follows : <PARA> these religious sideshows take on the trappings of political conventions . the president is always invited , but clearly the [ national religious broadcasters convention ] delegates prefer a republican . one year , george bush was a speaker at the nrb convention and said that his favorite bible verse was “ john 16 : 3 .” unless he had dyslexia , he meant to say john 3 : 16 , but the moment taught a lesson . someone must have said , “ here , give them a bible verse , mention god , and they ’ ll vote for you next time .”	
unproven	examples : [ collected via e - mail , march 2009 ] <PARA> a fire alarm , in a large office building , rang at 4 p . m . when almost all of the company ’ s 500 employees were at work . as usual in such circumtances the entire office was evacuated within 3 mins & every employee gathered outside . <PARA> nothing happened for ten minutes or so and there was no evidence of a fire . <PARA> then the firms security officer made an announcement ... <PARA> “ dear employees , with melting heart i am making this announcement that for many of you will be your last fire evacuation drill . due to the recession the company are laying off almost fifty percent of staff . when you move back into the building some of you will discover that your swipe passcard will no longer give you access to the office . if you are among those laid off , go home and all your belongings will be couriered to you tomorrow . the management took this approach to save on overloading the email system with layoff notifications and goodbye messages and also to avoid any violent outbursts inside the office . hope you have a nice career ahead .. please move forward and try your swipe card .” <PARA> a fire alarm rang at 4 pm in a large office campus when almost all employees were present ( approx 5 , 000 people ). <PARA> as per past fire - drill practices , the entire office was quickly evacuated within 3 minutes , and all employees gathered outside the complex in designated areas waiting for further announcement . <PARA> before long , the fire drill officer in - charge made the following broadcast over their loud - speakers system : <PARA> “ my dear colleagues : <PARA> with sincere regret , i have been asked to announce that for many of you , this will be your last evacuation drill with us . due to the on - going recession and bad business climate , the company is laying off almost 50 % of its staff . <PARA> so when this announcement finishes , i ask all of you to move back into the building . and if your swipe - card does not work , then it means that you have been laid off , in which case you will not be allowed inside , and all your personal belongings will be couriered to you by tomorrow . <PARA> the company is using this innovative , never - before approach as we do not want to choke our email system with lay - off notices and farewell messages going by the thousands , and we also wish to avoid any fighting inside the office and the consequent security issues for all staff . <PARA> we hope you have had a rewarding career with us . now please move back inside and good luck to you !” <PARA> origins : this legend has so far circulated online in two forms , one which asserts the uncaring company is located in singapore , the other which does not specify the location of the firm ( and thus leads readers to conclude it ’ s local to them ). <PARA> although this tale made its internet debut in early february 2009 , it ’ s actually much older . in 1994 it was heard at the houston office of a major oil company which at that time was laying off thousands of workers . according to the rumor , managers at the company ’ s new orleans office — fearing those being laid off might try to sabotage operations — held a fire drill and evacuated the building , then let back inside only those employees being retained . <PARA> while widespread layoffs within even previously stable companies and industries are becoming a grim reality as the recession of 2009 takes hold , we ’ ve found no evidence that any has been effected by such means . had one been , it would not have escaped the media ’ s notice , as certainly at least a few of those so discarded would have brought the <PARA> matter to the attention of the press . <PARA> it ’ s also unlikely the scenario described above could take place in the u . s ., as there are a number of reasons why people who lose their jobs to corporate downsizing can ’ t be summarily sent packing with just a moment ’ s notice . for one , the warn act requires employers to provide 60 days advance notice for mass layoffs . also , layoffs entail the completion and signing of a good deal of legal paperwork that could not be accomplished if dismissed employees were simply tricked out the door and immediately sent home . in addition , many employees responding to a fire alarm might very well leave behind vital personal belongings ( e . g ., car keys , purses , medications ) which they could not do without until someone finally got around to couriering them to their homes . <PARA> interestingly , in may 2007 key elements of the legend did come true in hexham in the u . k . bosses at the robbs department store there deliberately set off the fire bell to clear the building of customers and get staff together in one place . at the designated fire point , the 140 members of staff were told the landmark store would be shutting down for good in two weeks ; the employees then returned to the building to continue working . management chose that method of informing the staff because the news that last - ditch efforts to secure a buyer had failed would be out by the end of the day , and management wanted their employees to hear it from them before hearing it from others . <PARA> a similar event took place at the mission viejo , california , offices of mortgage lender firstplus direct in october 1998 . at 5 : 30 p . m . one evening , employees still in the facility “ were told over the loudspeaker there was an emergency and to leave the building ” and were searched by guards on their way out . the following morning , employees arriving for work were “ handed manila envelopes with termination letters plus forms for extending benefits and reclaiming personal possessions .” however , as with the robbs department store incident , this was an instance of an entire facility ’ s being shut down and all its employees let go , not a case of a selective layoff with re - entry privileges after a fire drill used to separate lucky employees from the suddenly unemployed . <PARA> the current legend is a way of putting into words the growing sense of anxiety many feel about the nebulous security of their jobs . as one large company after another gives the axe to significant portions of their workforces , even employees of long standing worry about how long they ’ ll continue to keep their jobs . could they one day come to work , only to without any advance warning get the dreaded pink slip ? <PARA> the “ fire drill layoff ” legend shines a spotlight on the dehumanizing aspect of large - scale downsizings via its focus not on the jobs lost , but on the way those being let go are dismissed . employees in this tale aren ’ t individually given a heartfelt “ sorry we can ’ t keep you ” by the corporation they ’ ve been giving their all to , but are instead herded as a group into the parking lot , addressed over a loudspeaker , and told in a brusque manner that if their keys still work they still have their jobs . there is no compassion , no recognition of years of service , no handshake and a “ we ’ re sorry to lose you ” speech from an immediate supervisor — instead , no one from the company so much as speaks to those being sent away to tell them their services are no longer required . as for those whose key cards still function , the message is clear : they ’ re darned lucky to have kept their jobs , and they might not be that fortunate during the next round of layoffs . <PARA> barbara “ survivor gilt ” mikkelson	
false	origins : no , this didn ’ t run in the dublin times , nor is it a real news story . this is simply a “ dumb crooks ” joke that plays on the duality of the word ‘ bank ’ being used to describe both a financial institution and a place where donated sperm is kept . it has been circulating on the internet since at least late 1998 , originally in a more generic version : <PARA> some gangsters were thinking of robbing a bank . they thought of the best plan that could be made and started to work . <PARA> a day or two later they are able to get into the bank and found hundreds of safes . they opened the first safe , but the only thing they found in there was a vanilla pudding . the head gangster says , “ well , at least we can eat it .” so they ate the pudding . <PARA> they opened up the second safe , but again there was just another pudding . they decided to devoured it , too . this process went on for the rest of the day , until all the safes were opened . there was no money or jewelry in any of them . “ well ,” they said , “ at least there was something for us to eat .” <PARA> the next day on the news , they heard , “ yesterday the biggest sperm bank in the usa was robbed . . .” <PARA> a day or two later they are able to get into the bank and found hundreds of safes . they opened the first safe , but the only thing they found in there was a vanilla pudding . the head gangster says , “ well , at least we can eat it .” so they ate the pudding . <PARA> they opened up the second safe , but again there was just another pudding . they decided to devoured it , too . this process went on for the rest of the day , until all the safes were opened . there was no money or jewelry in any of them . “ well ,” they said , “ at least there was something for us to eat .” <PARA> the next day on the news , they heard , “ yesterday the biggest sperm bank in the usa was robbed . . .” <PARA> the joke soon mutated into versions featuring robbers belonging to groups typically used as the butts of jokes ( e . g ., blonde robbers , irish robbers ); the irish version caught on , and the apocryphal “ dublin times ” citation was added <PARA> later . <PARA> sperm banks and “ real ” banks have little in common other than their mutual use of the word ‘ bank .’ although sperm banks may keep their deposits in locked containers for security and privacy reasons , those containers in no way resemble the vaults or safes used to protect more conventional valuables such as currency . sperm samples also have to be maintained in refrigerated containers — it would be a very dim crook indeed who didn ’ t wonder why cash was being kept cold ( or , more implausibly , why ‘ vanilla pudding ’ was being kept locked away ). sperm also isn ’ t stored in “ covered bowls ” ( or anything resembling bowls ) but in individual test tube - like containers . and we have it on good authority that it ’ s nothing like vanilla pudding , either in taste or in consistency .	
mixture	what a wonderful idea , i just wish it had been mine . i have a feeling that usps is going to have a hell of a lot of tea to contend with , after all it only costs 42 cents to send a message , hopefully heard round the world !!! <PARA> so please mark your calendars <PARA> there ’ s a storm abrewin ’. what happens when good , responsible people keep quiet ? washington has forgotten they work for us . we don ’ t work for them . throwing good money after bad is not the answer . i am sick of the midnight , closed door sessions to come up with a plan . i am sick of congress raking ceo ’ s over the coals while they , themselves , have defaulted on their taxes . i am sick of the bailed out companies having lavish vacations and retreats on my dollar . i am sick of being told it is my responsibility to rescue people that , knowingly , bought more house than they could afford . i am sick of being made to feel it is my patriotic duty to pay more taxes . i , like all of you , am a responsible citizen . i pay my taxes . i live on a budget and i don ’ t ask someone else to carry the burden for poor decisions i may make . i have emailed my congressmen and senators asking them to not vote for the stimulus package as it was written without reading it first . no one listened . they voted for it , pork and all . <PARA> o . k . folks , here it is . you may think you are just one voice and what you think won ’ t make a difference . well , yes it will and yes , we can !! if you are disgusted and angry with the way washington is handling our taxes . if you are fearful of the fallout from the reckless spending of billions to bailout and “ stimulate ” without accountability and responsibility then we need to become one , loud voice that can be heard from every city , town , suburb and home in america . there is a growing protest to demand that congress , the president and his cabinet listen to us , the american citizens . what is being done in washington is not the way to handle the economic free fall . <PARA> so , here ’ s the plan . on april 1 , 2009 , all americans are asked to send a teabag to washington , d . c . you do not have to enclose a note or any other information unless you so desire . just a teabag . many cities are organizing protests . if you simply search , “ new american tea party ”, several sites will come up . if you aren ’ t the ‘ protester ’ type , simply make your one voice heard with a teabag . your one voice will become a roar when joined with millions of others that feel the same way . yes , something needs to be done but the lack of confidence as shown by the steady decline in the stock market speaks volumes . <PARA> this was not my idea . i visited the sites of the ‘ new american tea party ’ and an online survey showed over 90 % of thousands said they would send the teabag on april 1 . why , april 1 ?? we want them to reach washington by april 15 . will you do it ? i will . send it to ; 1600 pennsylvania ave . washington , d . c . 20500 . <PARA> forward this to everyone in your address book . visit the website for more information about the ‘ new american tea party ’. i would encourage everyone to go ahead and get the envelope ready to mail , then just drop it in the mail april 1 . can ’ t guarantee what the postage will be by then , it is going up as we speak , but have your envelope ready . what will this cost you ? a little time and a 40 something cent stamp .. <PARA> what could you receive in benefits ? maybe , just maybe , our elected officials will start to listen to the people . take out the pork . tell us how the money is being spent . we want transparency and accountability . remember , the money will be spent over the next 4 - 5 years . it is not too late . <PARA> of course , if you agree with the way things are being done now , just delete !!!!! <PARA> origins : on the evening of 16 december 1773 , a group of american colonists who called themselves “ the sons of liberty ” furtively boarded the ship dartmouth , which was docked in boston harbor with a load of east india company tea . working <PARA> through the night , the colonists dumped over 45 tons of tea into the waters of the harbor as a protest against the tea act passed by the british government . the event , which came to be known as “ the boston tea party ,” was one of the seminal events of the american revolution and remains one of the most iconic moments in all of u . s . history . <PARA> in 2009 , the iconic status of that event was referenced in the name of the new american tea party , described as a “ coalition of citizens and organizations concerned about the recent trend of fiscal recklessness in government ” who have begun coordinating events around the u . s . with the announced goal of protesting largesse in federal spending . the item quoted above seeks to take up the “ tea party ” spirit by encouraging americans to mail tea bags to the white house on 1 april 2009 ( in order to arrive by 15 april , the day on which income tax filings are due ) as a form of symbolic protest against “ the way washington is handling our taxes .” ( the concept is vaguely reminiscent of a 1955 campaign that had citizens mailing small bags of wheat to president eisenhower to encourage the u . s . to provide surplus food to flood victims in china .) <PARA> of course , everyone is free to choose whether or not to participate in symbolic protests , so such actions don ’ t have much in the way of verifiable “ true ” or “ false ” aspects — the only issue is how effective the chosen form of protest is likely to be . with that in mind , we offer a few caveats for those inclined to participate : <PARA> we have received hundreds of questions about an email circulating that urges folks to send tea to washington on april 1st or april 15th . this effort is not endorsed by the new american tea party , so we can ’ t answer any questions about it . <PARA> it is a neat idea , but things like that will likely either be held up getting scanned or end up getting thrown away due to security precautions . <PARA> ( a subsequent new american tea party blog entry suggested that just mailing the labels from tea bags might be a way of avoiding this potential pitfall .)	
true	examples : [ collected via e - mail , february 2009 ] <PARA> let us not be lulled into a sense of complacency , due to the recent political success of president obama . racism still exists in this country . like all things , nothing is perfect on this planet , in this world . we have an obligation to be active on issues that simply cannot be ignored . along these lines we should all actively spread the word of how barnes and noble apparently feels about black people or at least our president . please forward this to as many people you think should be aware of this and would be offended by this . boycotting barnes and n ! oble wil l show the economic effect of people who will not tolerate racism . <PARA> barnes and noble had this as their store front display in coral gables , fl in the miracle mile mall . i am totally disgusted and i think it is important that we all find a different place to buy our books . obviously this is a place of extreme ignorance . how far have we really come ? god bless . <PARA> here we go ! <PARA> i am a confirmed bibliophile and have spent hundreds ( or probably thousands ) of dollars at your stores and their affiliates over the past two decades . i just received this link from my sister in new jersey . after seeing this merchandising display in the link below , you can be assured i will not shop at barnes and noble or any of their affiliates ! you can also be assured that i will pass a copy of this e - mail along to as many people as possible , including the members of moveon . org and any other large group of people who might also be outraged by this blatant and malicious characterization of the first family . you have allowed your employees to orchestrate a racist display under the guise of “ merchandising ”! enough is enough . <PARA> origins : given the recent political controversy over perceived racist <PARA> connotations in a new york post political cartoon that used the imagery of a violent chimpanzee shot dead by police to comment on the debate over president barack obama ’ s economic stimulus bill , any connection ( intentional or otherwise ) between the presidential image and that of monkeys or apes is bound to come under particularly strong scrutiny right now . <PARA> it was therefore not surprising that this purported image of the window of a barnes & noble retail book outlet , showing volumes about president obama surrounding a book about monkeys , quickly drew widespread attention ( and outrage ) on the internet . barnes & noble spokesperson mary ellen keating apologized for the photo , saying that although one of chain ’ s florida stores did indeed feature the window display pictured , they believed it to be the result of a customer prank rather than a deliberate action of any of the company ’ s employees : <PARA> barnes & noble would like to publicly apologize for an incident in our coral gables , florida store . we believe that a customer played a cruel joke and placed an inappropriate title (“ monkeys ”) in the front window of our store , where we were featuring books written by or about president obama . we want to assure our customers that the book placed by someone other than any of our booksellers was never intended to be included in our display and was removed as soon as we became aware of the situation . we are looking into it and taking the steps necessary so that it does not happen again . from time to time customers will move titles from one area of the store to another . in this particular case , we do not condone whatever message may have been intended with the placement of this title in our presidential display . it certainly was not part of our merchandising and we regret that we didn ’ t see the placement of this title immediately .	
false	an item that began circulating online in the latter half of the year 2000 was neither an accurate description of actor / director mel gibson ’ s early life nor a transcription of a radio piece by commentator paul harvey . suffice it to say that someone took the framework of mel gibson ’ s biography and built upon it a touching but completely fictitious house of glurge : <PARA> mel gibson ’ s father did move his family from new york to sydney , australia , when mel was 12 , but the similarities between this piece and mel ’ s real life end there . young mel wasn ’ t dreaming of “ joining the circus as a trapeze artist ”; he was a catholic high school student mulling over the possibilities of becoming a chef or a journalist and ended up enrolling in the university of new south wales ’ national institute of dramatic art . young mel had a role in the low - budget film summer city while still a student and then appeared in a number of productions with the state theatre company of south australia before the lucky break that catapulted him to stardom : being chosen for the lead role in george miller ’ s action film mad max . <PARA> a little bit of truth may have sneaked into the story quoted above at this point . the night before his mad max audition , gibson reportedly came in a poor second in a barroom brawl , ending up with a face “ like a busted grapefruit .” he then had to audition for the mad max role with a bruised , swollen , discolored , and freshly stitched face — an appearance that , legend has it , helped win over producers who wanted someone weathered and rough - looking to take the part . <PARA> the beating gibson received did not , however , leave him with “ smashed eye sockets ,” fracture his “ skull , legs , and arms ,” result in the loss of “ all his teeth ” or a nose that was “ hanging from his face ” or a “ jaw almost completely torn from his skull .” he didn ’ t spend “ over a year in the hospital ,” nor did five years pass with mel in agony before “ plastic surgery restored his looks .” his face got smashed up a bit , he required a few stitches to close some open cuts , and a few weeks later he was good as new . ( however , some hollywood pundits maintain that even the milder “ barroom brawl ” version was a bit of fiction invented by a publicist .) <PARA> mel gibson did direct and star in the man without a face , a 1993 film about a man who became a recluse after his features were disfigured in an automobile accident , but the movie was based upon a novel by isabelle holland , not mel gibson ’ s life . <PARA> many of our readers have sworn to us they heard paul harvey recite this piece , exactly as reproduced above , on one of his broadcasts . paul harvey did offer a “ rest of the story ” segment about mel gibson on 24 june 2000 , and it was a typically ( for paul harvey ) exaggerated version of the truth , but it didn ’ t come close to the glurge reproduced here . what harvey reported , verbatim , was this : <PARA> and now you know ... the real story . <PARA> the february 2004 release of the film the passion of the christ , financed and directed by mel gibson , started this legend circulating anew , often with tacked - on codas such as the following :	
false	origins : “ how did you guys meet ?” is a question commonly posed to couples , and the answers may range from a mundane “ oh , we met at work ” or “ we were introduced by a mutual friend ” to a comical or bizarre one - in - a - million chain of coincidences that brought two strangers together . yet for all the variegated responses this question might possibly elicit , the statistic quoted above suggests that by far the most common response is an ordinary and simple one : the overwhelming majority of married couples ( 90 %) originally met and established an initial romantic <PARA> relationship during their secondary school ( i . e ., junior high or high school ) years . <PARA> but is this statistic accurate ? it might have been true ( or closer to true ) in an earlier era , when people tended to marry younger , when a larger percentage of the population lived in rural areas and / or spent most of their lives close to their birthplaces , and when the opportunities for meeting and mingling with members of the opposite sex after the completion of high school were limited by more restrictive social mores and a more rigid separation of the sexes in the areas of employment and post - secondary education . however , we could find no evidence documenting that the cited 90 % figure is ( or was ) true any time in the last few decades , at least for the united states . <PARA> statistics about how married couples met vary from year to year ( and survey to survey ), but studies in recent years have consistently reported that more couples met through family or friends , at college , at work , or online than in secondary school . for example : <PARA> according to a harris interactive online survey of more than 10 , 000 people who married in the us during an 18 - month period in 2006 and 2007 , nineteen per cent of the couples met online , compared with 17 per cent who met at work and 17 per cent who met through friends . in contrast , a similar poll of almost 5000 couples who married between september 2004 and august 2005 found that 14 per cent met online , compared with 20 per cent at work and 17 per cent through friends . <PARA> another harris interactive survey conducted in january 2006 asked respondents who were currently involved in relationships ( although not necessarily married ) “ how did you meet your current partner ?” and compiled the following results . note that the “ school ” category , even though it encompassed both secondary school and college , was the answer given by only 14 % of the total respondent base : <PARA> even allowing for some potential biases in survey methods ( e . g ., online surveys might target a greater preponderance of people who met online than other survey methods would ), it seems clear from these and similar studies conducted since the early 1990s that nowhere close to 90 % of u . s . marriages are matches between people who were secondary school sweethearts . <PARA> one of our favorite “ how they met ” stories ( true or not ) is the following , told of former major league baseball player cal ripken jr .: <PARA> about two months later , a young woman approached him and said , “ thanks for being so nice to my mom .” <PARA> cal replied , “ oh , are you kelly ?” <PARA> she was , and now she ’ s mrs . ripken .	
false	origins : yes , the manbeef . com site is quite slick , nicely laid out and chock full of background information , sales pitches , recipes for human meat , and even company t - shirts for sale . yes , you may even have heard a “ representative ” from manbeef discussing ( through a voice changer , because of the “ death threats ” he claims he ’ s received ) their products on a local talk radio program . and yes , it ’ s nothing but a hoax . <PARA> cannibalism is undoubtedly the strongest taboo in modern society , and in a country where most people turn up their noses in digust at the thought of eating horsemeat or duck eggs , the sales potential for human meat is negligible . aside from that pesky marketing problem , however , is the inconvenient fact that it simply isn ’ t legal to sell human flesh for consumption ( by other humans or anything else ) anywhere in the united states ( or to export it out of the usa ), no matter how “ fresh ” or carefully packaged it may be . ( the recent scares over mad cow disease have led people to object to the practice of feeding livestock ground - up parts of other livestock , so the notion of humans eating other humans just isn ’ t going to fly .) <PARA> the food safety and inspection service , under the aegis of the united states department of agriculture , is the agency tasked with the inspection of meat sold in or exported from the usa : <PARA> under the federal meat inspection act and the poultry products inspection act , fsis inspects all raw meat and poultry sold in interstate and foreign commerce , including imported products . the agency monitors meat and poultry products after they leave federally inspected plants . <PARA> in addition , fsis monitors state inspection programs , which inspect meat and poultry products sold only within the state in which they were produced . the 1967 wholesome meat act and the 1968 wholesome poultry products act require state inspection programs to be “ at least equal to ” the federal inspection program . if states choose to end their inspection program or cannot maintain this standard , fsis must assume responsibility for inspection within that state . <PARA> in addition , fsis monitors state inspection programs , which inspect meat and poultry products sold only within the state in which they were produced . the 1967 wholesome meat act and the 1968 wholesome poultry products act require state inspection programs to be “ at least equal to ” the federal inspection program . if states choose to end their inspection program or cannot maintain this standard , fsis must assume responsibility for inspection within that state . <PARA> when we queried the usda about the possibility of purchasing a few “ people chops ” from manbeef . com , they responded : <PARA> it is definitely a hoax and you are right , it is illegal to sell human meat , by absence of legality . in other words , meat and poultry to be sold must be inspected by a federal authority . for example , to sell beef it must have the usda inspection seal on it . if that seal is not on the meat , it can ’ t be sold . food that is not under usda inspection , like alligator , must be inspected by the fda . it is illegal for any restaurant or store to sell food without federal inspection . federal compliance officers routinely inspect restaurants and grocery stores to ensure that the food that they sell has the required inspection stamps on them . <PARA> needless <PARA> to say , neither the fda nor the usda does — or ever has — approved the sale of human meat in the usa or its export to other countries . ( that latter part puts the kibosh on the manbeef hoaxsters ’ dodge that “ the company ’ s main market is asia and the middle east .” in fact , an arabic newspaper in sudan was shut down for two days merely for printing an article about manbeef , a topic considered “ offending to the public taste .”) <PARA> of course , pesky facts about the non - legality of selling human meat don ’ t really cut into manbeef ’ s “ sales ,” since you can ’ t actually order anything from their web site ( other than t - shirts and coffee mugs ) because , they claim : <PARA> we do this , because we prefer to deal with our customers on a more personal basis . because we are so focused on customer service and customer satisfaction , we do not wish to lose all contact with our customers . because we cater to a select group of clientele , we find it better to deal directly with our customers . <PARA> we also do not sell products directly off of our website because we would be unable to meet the demand of thousands of orders per day . because the supply of high quality human meat is limited , we have to limit the number of orders we accept . <PARA> we also do not sell products directly off of our website because we would be unable to meet the demand of thousands of orders per day . because the supply of high quality human meat is limited , we have to limit the number of orders we accept . <PARA> that ’ s certainly a novel way of doing business : “ we already have more orders than we can handle , so we ’ re going to put up a web site to advertise our product to customers whom we can ’ t service .” since the web site doesn ’ t include a physical address prospective “ customers ” can visit , a mailing address they can write to , or a phone number they can use to order manbeef ’ s alleged products , you have to wonder just how manbeef conducts any business at all , let alone business on a “ personal basis .” <PARA> if you want to “ order ” from manbeef . com , you have to apply for a “ membership ” on their web site , which brings a mail message asking for additional information and informing you that : <PARA> once we have this information , we will run a background check on you . by sending in the above information you agree to allow us to have a background check performed . because manbeef international meats can not legally sell any human meat product to anyone with a criminal history , we would like to ask you a couple questions now , before we begin a background check . <PARA> at least this part is literally , if deceptively , true : they “ can not legally sell any human meat product to anyone with a criminal history ” because they cannot legally sell any human meat product to anyone . <PARA> if you declare yourself to be a non - felon ( and swear you don ’ t associate with felons ), you get a message back telling you that a “ background check ” is being run on you . manbeef is a bit backed up running those “ background checks ” though , so don ’ t hold your breath : <PARA> there are currently ( 91 ) other persons scheduled before you for background checks . the background check generally takes 7 days to process . your background check is scheduled to begin at the below date : <PARA> schedule date : ( may 21 , 2001 ) <PARA> once the background check has completed we will mail you a copy of our contract . after the signed contract has been mailed back to us , we will mail you the members packet . this packet includes information we do not give out on the website , such as toll free phone numbers for all manbeef divisions , addresses for ordering and shipping , and special sales . every packet also includes a 45 minute video tape titled “ manbeef and you ”. this tape covers the basics of human meat cooking , storage , and some interesting human meat tips and tricks . <PARA> schedule date : ( may 21 , 2001 ) <PARA> once the background check has completed we will mail you a copy of our contract . after the signed contract has been mailed back to us , we will mail you the members packet . this packet includes information we do not give out on the website , such as toll free phone numbers for all manbeef divisions , addresses for ordering and shipping , and special sales . every packet also includes a 45 minute video tape titled “ manbeef and you ”. this tape covers the basics of human meat cooking , storage , and some interesting human meat tips and tricks . <PARA> our “ background check ” date came and went , but we received nothing further from manbeef — no contract , no information packet , no “ manbeef and you ” video . what a surprise . <PARA> note that the phone number listed for the technical and the administrative contact in the domain registration of this “ international ” company ’ s web site doesn ’ t correspond to the new york address given and traces back to a 16 - year - old in apex , nc , and that said 16 - year - old ’ s own domain was established with the very same registrar as manbeef . com ’ s . also note that the binghamton , new york , address listed in the registration is phony : manbeef has no offices there , and county officials verified that they have no business license on file for a manbeef international meats . now the map showing binghamton as the home of manbeef ’ s “ regional headquarters ” has disappeared from the manbeef . com web site . what a surprise . <PARA> in june 2001 , manbeef ’ s sole “ employee ” ( and putative “ president ”) finally confessed : <PARA> soon we will be publishing some pages on our website stating that manbeef is in fact a joke . <PARA> alas , that promise also turned out to be hoax . <PARA> update : as of 2005 , manbeef . com became a porn site and the hoax site moved to <URL>	
false	many explanations have been advanced to explain our custom of clinking glasses when participating in toasts . one is that early europeans felt the sound helped to drive off evil spirits . another holds that by clanking the glasses into one another , wine could be sloshed from glass to glass , thereby serving as a proof the beverages had not been poisoned . yet another claim asserts that the “ clink ” served as a symbolic acknowledgment of trust among imbibers who did not feel the need to sample each others ’ drinks to prove them unadulterated . <PARA> examples : <PARA> each of those explanations is false . while making a racket for the purpose of scaring off evil spirits underpins other customs that carry over to this day ( e . g ., the tolling of church bells at weddings , and the loud shouts and noisemaking at the stroke of twelve on new year ’ s eve ), the “ clink ” is a relatively new aspect of toasting and , as such , came along well after folks had relinquished the notion that demons both lurked in every corner of typical day - to - day existence and could be sped on their way by a bit of noise . as for sloshing wine from one glass to another , drinking vessels would need to be filled to the brim to effect that , and if they were , such practice would waste valuable potables ( because some would be sure to land on the floor ) and likely douse the toasters too . and while the poisoning of enemies has long been part of the ordinary mayhem of the world , the practice of touching of one ’ s filled glass to those of others when participating in a toast is unrelated to suspicion of the wine ’ s having been tampered with ; such killings were not so common at any nebulous point in the past that a signal to one ’ s host indicating he was clear of suspicion of attempted murder needed to be enshrined in the canon of social gestures . <PARA> to get at the real reason for the clink of glass on glass , we have to first look at why and how we toast , and where the practice originated . <PARA> the custom of sealing with booze expressions of good wishes for the health of others dates back so far that its origins are now lost to us , yet in numerous cultures such acts of camaraderie often involved shared drinking vessels . the clinking of individual cups or glasses as a proof of trust wouldn ’ t have meant much when everyone drank from the same bowl . indeed , in those cultures where shared drinking containers was the norm , to produce one ’ s own vessel in such company was to communicate an unmistakable message of hostility and distrust ; it would have been regarded as akin to bringing along a food taster to sample the repast . <PARA> “ toasting ,” our term for the pronouncement of benedictions followed by a swallowing of alcohol , is believed to have taken its name from a practice involving a shared drinking vessel . floated in the “ loving cup ” passed among celebrants in britain was a piece of ( spiced ) cooked bread that the host would consume along with the last few drops of liquid after the cup had made one round of the company . in modern times toasting has become a matter of imbibing from individual drinking vessels rather than from one shared flagon , so to compensate for the sense of unity lost in doing away with the sharing of the same cup we have evolved the practice of simultaneously drinking each from our own glass when a toast is made , thereby maintaining a communal connection to the kind words being spoken . <PARA> the clinking of glasses has been added to the practice of offering toasts for a few reasons , none having anything to do with poison . prior to such augmentation , toasts pleased only four of the five senses ; by adding the “ clink ,” a pleasant sound was made part of the experience , and wine glasses have come to be prized not only for their appearance but also for the tones they produce when struck . yet beyond mere aural pleasure , the act of touching your glass to that of others is a way of emphasizing that you are part of the good wishes being expressed , that you are making a physical connection to the toast . the practice also serves another purpose , that of uniting the individuals taking part in the benediction into a cohesive group : as the wine glasses are brought together , so symbolically are the people holding them . on a deeper level , the wine is also being recommuned with itself — that which had been one ( when it had been in its own bottle ) but was separated ( when it was poured into a variety of glasses ) is brought back into contact with the whole of itself , if only for a moment . <PARA> etiquette mavens say one need not clink glasses with everyone present when participating in toasts among large assemblies . rather than reach across vast expanses of wide tables ( thereby risking losing your balance and ending up in the guacamole ), simply raise your glass and make eye contact with the group .	
unproven	as a joke , my brother used to hang a pair of panty hose over his fireplace before christmas . he said all he wanted was for santa to fill them . what they say about santa checking the list twice must be true because every christmas morning , although jay ’ s kids ’ stockings were overflowed , his poor pantyhose hung sadly empty . <PARA> one year i decided to make his dream come true . i put on sunglasses and went in search of an inflatable love doll . they don ’ t sell those things at wal - mart . i had to go to an adult bookstore downtown . if you ’ ve never been in an x - rated store , don ’ t go . you ’ ll only confuse yourself . i was there an hour saying things like , “ what does this do ?” “ you ’ re kidding me !” “ who would buy that ?” finally , i made it to the inflatable doll section . i wanted to buy a standard , uncomplicated doll that could also substitute as a passenger in my truck so i could use the car pool lane during rush hour . finding what i wanted was difficult . love dolls come in many different models . the top of the line , according to the side of the box , could do things i ’ d only seen in a book on animal husbandry . i settled for ‘ lovable louise .” she was at the bottom of the price scale . to call louise a “ doll ” took a huge leap of imagination . <PARA> on christmas eve , with the help of an old bicycle pump , louise came to life . my sister - in - law was in on the plan and let me in during the wee morning hours , long after santa had come and gone , i filled the dangling pantyhose with louise ’ s pliant legs and bottom . i also ate some cookies and drank what remained of a glass of milk on a nearby tray . i went home , and giggled for a couple of hours . the next morning my brother called to say that santa had been to his house and left a present that had made him very happy but had left the dog confused . she would bark , start to walk away , then come back and bark some more . <PARA> we all agreed that louise should remain in her panty hose so the rest of the family could admire her when they came over for the traditional christmas dinner . my grandmother noticed louise the moment she walked in the door . “ what the hell is that ?” she asked . my brother quickly explained , “ it ’ s a doll .” “ who would play with something like that ?” granny snapped . i had several candidates in mind , but kept my mouth shut . “ where are her clothes ?” granny continued . “ boy , that <PARA> turkey sure smells nice , gran ,” jay said , trying to steer her into the dining room . but granny was relentless . “ why doesn ’ t she have any teeth ?” again , i could have answered , but why would i ? it was christmas and no one wanted to ride in the back of the ambulance saying ,” hang on granny ! hang on !” my grandfather , a delightful old man with poor eyesight , sidled up to me and said , ” hey , who ’ s the naked gal by the fireplace ?” i told him she was jay ’ s friend . <PARA> a few minutes later i noticed grandpa by the mantel , talking to louise . not just talking , but actually flirting . it was then that we realized this might be grandpa ’ s last christmas at home . <PARA> the dinner went well . we made the usual small talk about who had died , who was dying , and who should be killed , when suddenly louise made a noise that sounded a lot like my father in the bathroom in the morning . then she lurched from the panty hose , flew around the room twice , and fell in a heap in front of the sofa . the cat screamed . i passed cranberry sauce through my nose , and grandpa ran across the room , fell to his knees , and began administering mouth to mouth resuscitation . my brother fell back over his chair and wet his pants and granny threw down her napkin , stomped out of the room , and sat in the car . <PARA> it was indeed a christmas to treasure and remember . <PARA> later in my brother ’ s garage , we conducted a thorough examination and found the cause of louise ’ s collapse . we discovered that louise had suffered from a hot amber to the back of her right thigh . fortunately , thanks to a wonder drug called duct tape , we restored her to perfect health . louise went on to star in several bachelor party movies . i think grandpa still calls her whenever he can get out of the house . <PARA> origins : sometimes a funny story is just a funny story , claims of “ this appeared in [ name of <PARA> newspaper ]” notwithstanding . there is no louisville sentinel , thus this story did not come from a competition sponsored by it , in 1999 or any other year . <PARA> the piece was actually written by humorist jeff foxworthy and appears in one of his books from 1996 . as for whether it ’ s a true story or not , foxworthy says on the opening page of his web site regarding his material : “ there ’ s my life story ( only 50 % of it lies ).” <PARA> the year 2001 seemed to be the year for “ inflatable love doll ” stories . in july , the specious tale about a woman who lept into traffic and died , thinking the rapture had arrived , took the internet by storm .

true	origins : jamie <PARA> symington ’ s experiences in recent weeks may have demonstrated the truth of the maxim that “ no good deed goes unpunished .” <PARA> symington , a 35 - year - old officer with the halifax , nova scotia , regional police service , drove to new york with a retired police dog named trakr on september 11 after viewing horrible scenes of the terrorist attack on the world trade center on television . he and trakr assisted with search - and - rescue efforts at the wtc site in new york , where symington claimed to have helped locate one survivor .

false	origins : this puzzler may indeed “ kill your brain !” and “ make you so mad !” — it certainly has left plenty of victims racking their brains and scratching their heads in decades past . if you don ’ t already know the answer to this one , let us help you preserve your sanity and whatever gray matter you may have left by telling you . . . there is no answer . other than ‘ hungry ’ and ‘ angry ,’ there is no english word ending with the letters ‘ gry ’ which the average native speaker of english would recognize , much less “ use every day ” ( and certainly none which a teller of this riddle could claim to have “ already given you ”). <PARA> all other words ending in ‘ gry ’ which one might find in even the most comprehensive english dictionary are either archaic terms or obsolete variant spellings , such as : <PARA> so , what ’ s the point to this puzzler if it has no answer ? some people maintain that is the point : the question was deliberately conceived as an irritating brain - teaser with no correct answer . the roundabout phrasing of the question suggests otherwise , however — more likely it was designed as a trick question rather than a trivia question , perhaps one whose wording has been corrupted over time or whose gimmick was only apparent when the question was delivered orally . <PARA> the most common guess is that this riddle is indeed a trick question , but the point of the trick has been lost through the rearrangement of the riddle ’ s wording as it has been passed along through the years . consider an alternate version of this puzzler : <PARA> think of words ending in - gry . angry and hungry are two of them . there are only three words in the english language . what is the third word ? the word is something that everyone uses every day . if you have listened carefully , i have already told you what it is . <PARA> this version supports the theory that the first two sentences are red herrings ; the catch is that the teller is literally asking you to identify the third word of the phrase “ the english language ” — there are only three words in the phrase “ the english language ,” the third word (“ language ”) describes something that one uses every day , and “ language ” is indeed a word which the teller has “ already told you .” this explanation also supports the contention that this riddle was meant to be presented orally , because a properly punctuated written version would make the gimmick too obvious : <PARA> think of words ending in - gry . “ angry ” and “ hungry ” are two of them . there are only three words in “ the english language .” what is the third word ? the word is something that everyone uses every day . if you have listened carefully , i have already told you what it is . <PARA> another hypothesis is that the current form of the riddle is a corruption of a yet another version , one which must also be delivered orally for its gimmick to make sense : <PARA> there are at least three words in the english language that end in g or y . one of them is “ hungry ” and another is “ angry .” there is a third word , a short one , which you probably say every day . if you listened carefully to everything i say , you just heard me say it . what is it ? <PARA> the catch here is that by offering the examples of “ hungry ” and “ angry ,” the teller misleads the listener into thinking he ’ s asking for a word ending in “ gry ” when he ’ s really asking for a word ending in “ g or y .” the correct answer in this case is “ say ,” a short word ending in “ y ” which the teller had pronounced three times in the course of presenting the riddle . <PARA> some people think this puzzler ’ s ability to continue stumping so many people over the years makes it one of the greatest riddles ever . we disagry .	
true	origins : in case the subtext of the letter quoted above isn ’ t obvious , here ’ s the setup : <PARA> a woman applies for a job with the public school system in the notoriously crime - ridden district of columbia . she ’ s turned down for employment because a background check reveals that she has a criminal record showing a long string of arrests for crimes ranging from prostitution and shoplifting to felonies such as drug dealing and assault with a deadly weapon ( a razor ), <PARA> with a charge of destruction of government property thrown in for good measure . ( the last item is even more significant because the applicant is seeking a job with the public school system , where she ’ d presumably be working with “ government property ” all day long .) <PARA> the disgruntled applicant then disputes the decision , furnishing proof that although she has been arrested a number of times ( and presumably indicted on some of the felony charges ), she ’ s never actually been convicted of anything — all the listed charges have been dismissed , no papered ( i . e ., the prosecutor declined to proceed ), or entered nolle prosequi ( i . e ., the prosecutor initially sought an indictment , but opted to proceed no further before the grand jury returned its findings ). hence , the dcps has to reconsider her employment application , even though everybody knows she ’ s a dangerous , violent criminal . ( we ’ re supposed to assume — as our court system does — that a person is innocent until proved guilty , but rare is the person among us who would look at an arrest record like the one presented here and not be convinced that the subject must be guilty of some of the charges ). <PARA> so , the letter quoted above is supposed to be a real - life example of how we ’ re being “ lawyered to death ,” of how the people we need protection from are allowed to “ abuse ” the protections of our legal system while we get the short end of the stick . but is it real , or merely a fabricated example intended to stir up our sense of moral outrage ? <PARA> the original source for this piece was the washington city paper of 12 january 2001 , where it ran in its “ loose lips ” column , and numerous publications ( of both the print and web varieties ) have reprinted this item since then . the washington city paper columnist assures us that the letter was indeed real , and that the dcps has sent out others like it as well . <PARA> maybe crime doesn ’ t pay , but sometimes criminals get paid .

mixture	origins : on 25 may 2006 , the u . s . senate , by a 62 - 36 bipartisan vote , finally passed the comprehensive immigration reform act of 2006 — a controversial bill which proponents touted as providing comprehensive and humane immigration reform , and which opponents criticized as unfairly rewarding illegal aliens by allowing them to obtain legal status . before the bill ’ s final passage , many different amendments were proposed by various senators ; some amendments were adopted , some amendments failed to pass , and some amendments modified or nullified provisions of earlier amendments . <PARA> amendment 4064 , proposed on 17 may 2006 , sought to “ declare english as the national language of the united states and to promote the patriotic integration of prospective u . s . citizens .” the relevant section of the amendment ( as passed ) read as follows : <PARA> the government of the united states shall preserve and enhance the role of english as the national language of the united states of america . unless otherwise authorized or provided by law , no person has a right , entitlement , or claim to have the government of the united states or any of its officials or representatives act , communicate , perform or provide services , or provide materials in any language other than english . if exceptions are made , that does not create a legal entitlement to additional services in that language or any language other than english . if any forms are issued by the federal government in a language other than english ( or such forms are completed in a language other than english ), the english language version of the form is the sole authority for all legal purposes . <PARA> in other words , this amendment declared that the federal government had no obligation to provide documents or services in any language other than english ; that if the federal government did choose to provide some documents or services in any language other than english , they were not <PARA> obligated to continue doing so ; and that if the federal government issued forms in other languages , the english - language version of those forms <PARA> would be legally pre - eminent . <PARA> this amendment was passed the next day by a vote of 62 - 35 , which is the vote referred to in the e - mail message quoted above . however , the message errs in stating that 38 senators voted against the amendment — 35 senators ( all of them democrats , save for one republican and one independent ) voted “ nay ,” and 3 senators ( two republicans and one democrat ) did not vote at all . ( also , the version we received is missing one name , as senator mary landrieu of louisiana , who also voted against the amendment , is not listed .) <PARA> the issue became even more complicated when , half an hour after amendment 4064 was passed , the senate voted on amendment 4073 . this amendment sought to “ declare that english is the common and unifying language of the united states , and to preserve and enhance the role of the english language .” the relevant section of the amendment ( as passed ) read as follows : <PARA> the government of the united states shall preserve and enhance the role of english as the common and unifying language of america . nothing herein shall diminish or expand any existing rights under the law of the united states relative to services or materials provided by the government of the united states in any language other than english . <PARA> for the purposes of this section , law is defined as including provisions of the united states code and the united states constitution , controlling judicial decisions , regulations , and controlling presidential executive orders . <PARA> for the purposes of this section , law is defined as including provisions of the united states code and the united states constitution , controlling judicial decisions , regulations , and controlling presidential executive orders . <PARA> in other words , this amendment contradicted the previously passed amendment by declaring that english was to be regarded as “ the common and unifying language of america ” ( rather than the “ national language of the united states of america ”), and that whatever obligations the federal government had to provide or honor documents and services in languages other than english should remain unchanged . this amendment also passed , by a vote of 58 - 39 .

true	few figures in american political history have been as reviled as president harry s . truman was when he left office in january 1953 . after the end of the great depression and world war ii , public dissatisfaction with 20 years of democratic rule , the new deal reforms enacted by franklin d . roosevelt , and numerous labor strikes , along with frightening political events such as the soviet union ’ s successful test of an atomic bomb , the communist revolution in china , and the stalemate of the korean war all combined to send truman ’ s popularity plummeting to an unprecedented nadir by the end of <PARA> 1952 . <PARA> in the half - century since the end of truman ’ s presidency , though , his popular image has undergone a remarkable reversal , and he is now held up by both republicans and democrats as the plain - speaking , tough - but - fair exemplar of what a president should be . a collection of anecdotes about harry s . truman reflects his modern image as the bluntly honest chief executive who refused to use his office as a stepping stone to personal gain : <PARA> the quote that opens this piece comes from president truman ’ s special message to the congress on the internal security of the united states , delivered on 8 august 1950 , in which he spoke out against the implementation of laws curbing expressions of dissent as a means of combating subversion : <PARA> when truman left the white house and returned to life as a private citizen in missouri in january 1953 , the u . s . did not provide any form of pension to former presidents . truman had little or no income beyond his army pension of $ 112 . 56 per month and bore all the costs of maintaining an office and staff himself , and it was largely due to his financial limitations that congress finally enacted the former presidents act ( fpa ) in 1958 to provide former presidents with pensions and allowances to cover office and travel expenses . <PARA> we couldn ’ t find a source for the quote that has truman declining offers of corporate positions at large salaries with the rebuff that “ you don ’ t want me . you want the office of the president , and that doesn ’ t belong to me . it belongs to the american people and it ’ s not for sale .” however , even if he didn ’ t use those exact words , truman did express that sentiment regarding the acceptance of corporate positions in his 1960 book , mr . citizen : <PARA> in may 1971 , towards the end of truman ’ s life ( he died in december 1972 ), the house of representatives was considering awarding the medal of honor to the former president . truman quashed such deliberations by writing a letter , read to the house on 6 may 1971 by rep . william j . randall of missouri , in which he maintained that the medal of honor was for combat bravery and that changing the requirements in his case would detract from the merit of the award : <PARA> ( truman ostensibly might have been awarded a “ legitimate ” medal of honor due to his service as an artillery captain with the u . s . army during world war i .) <PARA> the legend - cum - joke about a respected , successful man who notes in retrospect that — had he enjoyed more advantages early in his life — he might have ended up as a piano player in a brothel is an old one , one which truman echoed when he observed ( as related in the book plain speaking ) that “ my choice early in life was either to be a piano player in a whorehouse or a politician . and to tell the truth , there ’ s hardly any difference .” however , the follow - up line , “ i , for one , believe the piano player job to be much more honorable than current politicians ,” does not appear in that book and is possibly an apocryphal addition rather than truman ’ s own words . <PARA> and yes , it is appropriate to render truman ’ s full name with a period after the ‘ s ’.

false	variations : <PARA> legends about spiders nesting in cactuses or yuccas imported from central america surfaced in scandinavia and great britain in the early 1970s . <PARA> in 1985 , an outbreak of “ spider in the yucca ” lore featured a plant supposedly bought from marks & spencer , a leading british department store . <PARA> though at times this story has slipped past the watchdogs of the mainstream media and been reported as a news story , it ’ s never been true . there has never been a spider - spewing exploding cactus , and there never will be . you see , the tale is impossible . <PARA> according to dr . clifford s . crawford , professor of biology at the university of new mexico , a tarantula might possibly lay eggs or build webs on , but not in , a cactus . curators at the desert museum in tucson , arizona , point out that tarantulas live in burrows in the ground , especially the female , which rarely moves around on the surface . no tarantulas or spiders of any type ever have been known to burrow into plants , says rod crawford , curator of arachnids at the burke museum . even if a small spider happened to climb into a hole in a cactus and lay eggs there , he says , the plant wouldn ’ t explode when the eggs hatched . tarantulas take several years to reach full size . <PARA> okay , so what about scorpions ? <PARA> unlike the tarantula , a scorpion and her young might seek shelter within a cactus . it is therefore theoretically possible to find a scorpion lurking in a succulent . however , hatching scorpions aren ’ t going to come flying out of a houseplant . a scorpion ’ s pregnancy lasts up to a year and a half . offspring are born live and then crawl onto their mother ’ s back for another two to six weeks of external development . the little horrors take up to seven years to mature and can live to an age of 25 . at no point in their growth is there a sudden spurt that would cause a cactus to erupt . <PARA> although there haven ’ t been any spider - filled cactuses , venomous eight - leggers have been found lurking in bunches of bananas and clusters of grapes which made their way to american consumers . spiders can — and do — show up in shipments of fruit . oftentimes those fruits are american - grown . <PARA> freeloading scorpions are a much rarer find , but they have been known to turn up . in 1993 , a british supermarket worker was stung by one which had been napping in a bunch of bananas . in 1989 , a british housewife discovered a similar hitchhiker when she began unwrapping her purchases at home . she escaped unscathed . <PARA> it ’ s a pretty clear - cut message : leave ‘ foreign ’ things where you find them ; don ’ t bring them home . the same theme runs through the mexican pet legend — the cute little doggie adopted abroad turns out to be vicious sewer rat . <PARA> as a final note , i leave you with this charming variant of the legend , as published in 1992 by foaftale news , the newsletter for the the international society for contemporary legend research :

unproven	origins : eighty - odd years after the fact , the november 1924 death of producer - director thomas ince remains shrouded in mystery . though the official <PARA> cause of death was given as indigestion and / or a heart attack , privately the rumors flew around hollywood that newspaper magnate william randolph hearst had shot ince aboard hearst ’ s yacht , the oneida . indeed , it ’ s whispered that the first los angeles times headline ( which didn ’ t survive into later editions ) read : movie producer shot on hearst yacht . <PARA> so what happened aboard the oneida ? and why ? <PARA> no coroner ’ s inquest into the producer ’ s death was held . the fact that ince ’ s mortal remains were cremated further muddied the waters , thereby dropping a final curtain upon any possibility of later exhumation and examination . if he died with a bullet in his head , we ’ ll never know for sure . such is the stuff of mysteries . and scandal . <PARA> how did ince come to be on the oneida ? a little jaunt from los angeles to san diego was planned in celebration of his 43rd birthday . as well as hearst , his lady - love marion davies , the ship ’ s crew and a jazz band , there were fifteen guests on the yacht that day , including charlie chaplin and louella parsons . ( this was louella ’ s first visit to hollywood — at that time she was but a mere hearst movie columnist in new york .) due to pressing commitments in tinseltown , ince did not make the trip down to san diego on hearst ’ s yacht as everyone else had — he took a train down the next day and joined the party already in progress . <PARA> the first stories in hearst ’ s newspapers about ince ’ s death were out - and - out fabrications — it was claimed ince had taken ill while visiting at hearst ’ s ranch and had been rushed home by ambulance , dying in the bosom of his family . the wheels quickly fell off this one , for too many people had seen him board the oneida in san diego . rumors were further fueled by chaplin ’ s secretary claiming to have seen a bullet hole in ince ’ s head as he was removed from the ship . <PARA> in time the rumors reached a high enough pitch that the district attorney for san diego could no longer ignore them . his investigation was curiously incomplete in that only one person was called to testify — dr . daniel goodman , a hearst employee . goodman claimed that he had traveled by train with the doomed producer , that ince had suffered heart pains during the trip , and that ince had admitted to having had these attacks before . this was apparently enough to satisfy the district attorney ; he then closed the investigation without pursuing it any further . no one else was <PARA> interviewed . <PARA> one possible reason for the d . a .’ s reluctance to do more than the bare minimum was the potential role liquor might have played in the affair . remember , this was the era of prohibition — drinking was against the law . it was an open secret that there had been booze aboard the oneida . were the investigation pursued any further , charges against someone or other would have had to have been laid . and how much of a fool would a d . a . have to be to bring william randolph hearst up on a liquor charge ? <PARA> hearst was not a drinking man . he tolerated the activity in others , but even then — only so far . weekend visitors to his fabled castle in san simeon quickly learned that they were allowed maybe all of two pre - dinner drinks , and that one of the fastest ways to get dumped back at the train station was to be caught boozing in the mansion , on the grounds , or even in the privacy of the individual guest houses . as i said , his tolerance only went so far . <PARA> getting back to ince ’ s death , if you accept that ince was shot , you also have to accept that it was by mistake — hearst had been aiming at someone else . always supremely possessive of his beloved marion davies , this wealthy yet sad man had invited charlie chaplin along so he could observe the two together . whispers had come to his ears , you see , that marion and charlie were more than platonic friends . <PARA> the rumor mill had it that hearst found the two lovebirds in a compromising position , that marion ’ s scream brought other guests running as hearst ran the other way to get his gun , and that in the ensuing scuffle ince , not chaplin , dropped with a bullet in his brain . possible ? well , it was known that hearst kept a gun aboard the oneida . also , as d . w . griffith remarked in later years , “ all you have to do to make hearst turn white as a ghost is mention ince ’ s name . there ’ s plenty wrong there , but hearst is too big to touch .” <PARA> an interesting side note to this tale : 1996 saw the publication of murder at san simeon , a novel by patricia hearst ( william randolph ’ s granddaughter ) and cordelia frances biddle . it ’ s a fictionalized version of this murder , presenting chaplin and davies as lovers and hearst as the jealous old man unwilling to share his lady - love with anyone else . <PARA> what of the unheralded movie columnist from new york ? many did not find it much of a coincidence that soon after this incident she was awarded a lifetime contract with the hearst corporation , or that her syndication was expanded . louella was always one to know how to be on hand for a breaking story , as well as how to feather her own nest with the bounty from such knowledge . <PARA> barbara “ ince ’ ing out the competition ” mikkelson

( three rivers bottling llc in new kensington , the bottling company from which the drink came , uses a high - speed , automated process that would make it next to impossible for anyone to insert something into a bottle on the production line . the drink is sold in clear bottles that are filled , instantly capped and then inspected at the plant . it was thus unlikely any item had been casually dropped into a passing <PARA> bottle .) <PARA> the local coroner authorized tests to make sure the find was indeed what it appeared to be : a 3 - inch length of human penis , neatly severed at the end . <PARA> the find prompted the recall of that line of punch by the manufacturer . production of the beverage was also halted at the bottling plant . <PARA> days later the coroner ’ s office announced the gruesome item was actually mold and not human tissue . according to them , the mold likely developed after the metal lid on the fruit punch bottle was tightened improperly , allowing air to seep through the cap . that air and the high sugar content of the drink made for an ideal climate for mold , which probably started growing from the underside of the lid . <PARA> as initially comforting that change in the status of things might be , further thought reveals that imbibing a liquid that a mold has been growing in isn ’ t all that much of an improvement . <PARA> barbara “ hold the mold , please ” mikkelson

unproven	most titanic buffs are familiar with one of the more remarkable coincidences associated with the sinking of that ill - fated ocean liner : fourteen years earlier , a writer named morgan robertson had penned a novella entitled futility about the largest and grandest ocean liner of its time — considered to be unsinkable because of her multiple water - tight compartments that could be sealed off automatically in case of emergency — which sank after striking an iceberg . numerous passengers lost their lives because the liner did not carry enough lifeboats to accommodate everyone . demonstrating an eery prescience , robertson had named his ship the titan . ( after the titanic disaster , the novella was reissued as the wreck of the titan .) <PARA> a much lesser known — but no less remarkable coincidence — is that at the very moment the titanic struck an iceberg in the north atlantic late in the evening of 14 april 1912 , the film the poseidon adventure — a movie about the desperate efforts of a group of passengers to survive the sinking of an ocean liner — was being screened aboard ship . <PARA> the film industry was still in its adolescence in 1912 , but it was already taking rapid strides towards maturity . the short flip card films viewed on customer - cranked kinetoscopes and mutoscopes in nickelodeons had given way to more elaborate films that were projected onto screens for audiences in movie theaters . these films were short ( generally no more than one reel in length ), and of course they were both silent and black - and - white , but they had already captured the imagination of a population eager for new forms of entertainment . the white star line , proudly dedicated to sparing no expense in ensuring that its new flagship titanic provided every luxury their passengers could desire , did not overlook this still relatively novel one : the titanic carried its own projector and a complement of movies rented from the british office of a u . s . film distributor . <PARA> the film industry had not quite shed the somewhat seedy image it had acquired in the days of the nickelodeon , however , which is one of the reasons why this detail of the titanic story has received relatively little attention . to avoid offending first class passengers who considered the fad of motion pictures to be less than genteel , movies were screened only in the second class dining saloon ( where first class passengers willing to risk their reputations were still free to venture if they so desired ). the films were also not run until after 11 : 00 p . m ., both because the aristocratic passengers who might have objected to the presence of this vulgar entertainment would have retired by that hour , and because the ship ’ s orchestra generally finished its evening concert for the first class passengers by that hour and was free to provide accompaniment for the otherwise silent movies . ( on evenings when the orchestra was otherwise engaged , a piano was available for the use of any brave passenger who might volunteer to improvise a soundtrack .) <PARA> ultimately , only two films were screened on the titanic before it met its tragic end less than five days into its maiden voyage . none was screened the first two days out , april 10 and 11 . in keeping with the nautical theme , the 1911 movie the lighthouse keeper , starring mary pickford , played on the evening of april 12 . this film proved so popular with the passengers that it was also run twice the following evening , april 13 . the next evening — the titanic ‘ s last , as it turned out — the entertainment switched to another 1911 film with a nautical theme , this one the work of an actor / director who was one of young hollywood ’ s fast - rising stars : d . w . griffith . the movie was the poseidon adventure ( unusual in its time for its length — an amazing 53 minutes in an era when the 10 - minute one - reeler was still the norm ), about a group of six passengers and crew members who struggle to stay alive after the ocean liner in which they ’ re traveling is capsized by a tidal wave . ( author paul gallico expanded on this scenario in his 1969 novel of the same name , which was in turn made into a feature film starring gene hackman and ernest borgnine in 1972 .) <PARA> the titanic ‘ s passengers , obviously unaware of the doom presaged by the film they were viewing , were so enthralled by the events of the the poseidon adventure that they failed to notice the slight shudder that marked the titanic ‘ s fatal encounter with an iceberg at approximately 11 : 40 p . m . ( in truth , many of the titanic ‘ s passengers either did not feel anything when the ship collided with the iceberg or did not consider the slight tremor they did feel to be anything extraordinary .) so enthusiastic was the audience ’ s reaction to the film ( and so slow was word of the true nature of the titanic ‘ s dire condition in spreading ) that the poseidon adventure was immediately screened for a second time just after midnight . <PARA> ultimately , the grim coincidence of a film about a sinking ocean liner ’ s being shown aboard a sinking ocean liner may have cost some passengers their lives . in the excitement over the two screenings of the movie , few in the enthusiastic audience noted that the titanic ‘ s engines had stopped ; even those who did didn ’ t manage to tear themselves away from the flickering screen long enough to go out on deck and inquire . by the time the second screening drew to its conclusion after 1 : 00 a . m . and a few hundred second class passengers filtered back out on deck and finally learned of the titanic ‘ s plight , all but a precious few of the woefully inadequate number of lifeboats had loaded and cast off — many of them carrying far less than capacity . could this explain why barely a third ( 116 out of 285 ) of the titanic ‘ s second class passengers and crew ultimately survived the disaster ? ( by way of comparison , nearly two - thirds of the first class passengers and crew — 201 out of 334 — survived .) we may never know . <PARA> the poseidon adventure ( 1911 ) ( internet movie database ) <PARA> more information about this page	
unproven	origins : it ’ s difficult to know what to make of this account ( ostensibly by a retired delta airlines pilot named pat gilmore ) about a putative encounter he had with mohamed atta , the leader of group of hijackers who <PARA> perpetrated the september 11 terrorist attacks on the united states . ( atta himself participated in the hijacking of american airlines flight 11 , the first of two planes to crash into the world trade center on 9 / 11 .) according to the author ’ s account , he realized in retrospect ( after viewing news coverage of the 9 / 11 attacks ) that during a flight from baltimore to atlanta on 26 july 2001 , he had unknowingly allowed atta to ride that flight in the cockpit jump seat , unaware of atta ’ s true identity because atta was garbed in the first officer ’ s uniform of another airline and carried all the requisite documentation identifying him as a pilot . <PARA> although the account is quite detailed , is doesn ’ t match the known details of the september 11 terrorist plot . the path of mohamed atta ’ s movements through the u . s .

( the kkk - snapple connection was but one of many similar slanders tying a number of innocent businesses to the kkk — that particular <PARA> rumored association was far from unique to snapple .) <PARA> times change , and so do those whom society views as the evildoers of the hour . though the kkk is as odious as ever , its particular brand of detestability has been eclipsed by that of the terrorists cowering in the mountains of afghanistan . one of the many rumors born in the aftermath of the september 11 attack on america links snapple with osama bin laden and calls for a grassroots boycott of this company ’ s line of products . <PARA> although bombs seem the obvious way to go after those who perpetrated the terrorist attacks on america , the real key to their undoing may well be economic . but that ’ s not nearly as visceral a solution as going into afghanistan with a war cry and guns blazing , and it ’ s not one which the average person can participate in or support in a tangible way , and so rumors like the one tying snapple to osama bin laden help fill the void . the typical american wants to experience the sense of vindication that comes from toppling this manifestation of evil , and so calls to boycott companies which are rumored to be filling the war chests of bin laden and his cronies therefore fall on highly receptive ears — many want to feel they ’ re part of the struggle , but the very nature of the battle denies them that opportunity . becoming part of an economic boycott would restore at least a part of that yearning for participation . <PARA> that type of rumor , though highly welcome , often outruns the facts . that is the case with the call to spurn snapple : <PARA> in a lengthy snapple press release , ceo michael weinstein wrote : <PARA> snapple has never had — and does not now — have any direct or indirect relationship of any kind whatsoever with osama bin laden or any other terrorist group or supporter . <PARA> that same press release contains the likely reason behind this particular blossoming of the “ allied with evil ” rumor : <PARA> if the source of these rumors is over our terminated relationship with a saudi arabian food distributorship , let me clarify this once and for all . some of our products — along with products from other respected american beverage and food companies — were distributed by a company that had an investment from the saudi binladin group . snapple has never had any reason to believe , nor do we now , that this company had any relationship of any kind with terrorists . nonetheless , several weeks ago , we terminated our relationship with this distributorship . <PARA> those unfamiliar with the binladin group might conclude from its name that it is osama bin laden ’ s corporate presence . in truth , the binladin group is one of the many corporate entities owned or participated in by any number of osama bin laden ’ s relatives , many of whom spell their surnames as binladin . the infamous terrorist hails from a family that is both very large and incredibly wealthy . osama has 54 siblings , and untangling the web of the family ’ s finances and business associations is nearly an impossible task . though it cannot absolutely be ruled out some of the income flowing into any of these entities reaches osama bin laden , it is widely understood that he is the family ’ s black sheep and that many members of this wide - reaching and far - flung assembly of relatives have utterly disowned him . <PARA> osama ’ s half - brother , 35 - year - old abdullah mohammed binladin , the only member of the family to speak publicly about their notorious relative since september 11 , said : “ i affirm that the binladin family and the saudi binladin group have no relationship whatsoever with osama or any of his activities . he shares no legal or beneficial interests with them or their assets or properties , and he is not directly or indirectly funded by them .” <PARA> as to who does own snapple , it ’ s now part of cadbury schweppes , a large uk corporation famous primarily for chocolate and carbonated beverages . cadbury schweppes is a publicly traded company on the london exchange . it is therefore not owned by any one person , but by <PARA> thousands . <PARA> snapple originated as unadulterated food corporation in 1972 and was little more than a hobby enterprise begun by leonard marsh , hyman golden , and arnold greenberg , who at the time were selling juices to health food stores . the first of its famed teas wasn ’ t introduced until 1987 , and the success of that line changed the company . the concern was acquired by quaker [ oats ] in 1994 , sold to triarc in 1997 , and sold again to cadbury schweppes in 2000 . <PARA> untangling the web of who owns what will be one of the biggest tasks those charged with fighting terrorism on the economic front will face in the years to come . it is more than likely the effort will prove that at least some of the terrorists or those who provide their funding have holdings in a variety of american companies that are innocently unaware of the details of each of their minor shareholders ’ private lives . ( the international world of finance being what it is , a diversified portfolio is a must , and that holds true for terrorists as well as for the law - abiding .) that will not mean that those companies whose shares turn up in the wrong hands support terrorism ; merely that one of the nasties bought a bit of stock without their knowing who he really was . <PARA> when such holdings come to light , there will be an outcry against those companies as those looking for someone to direct their anger towards will at least momentarily feel they ’ ve found someone deserving of their ire . they ’ ll be wrong , but that will probably do little to stem the tide of criticism they ’ ll unleash . <PARA> barbara “ who let the dogs out ?” mikkelson

false	origins : by way of filling out space in this article , i ’ ll start off <PARA> by noting that although i ’ m not really a golf fan , if i had to choose a favorite golfer it would be phil mickelson . not only do we share a surname ( albeit with a slightly different spelling ), but we also share a handedness quirk : phil mickelson is right - handed but plays golf like a lefty ; i ’ m a southpaw who swings golf clubs ( i couldn ’ t really qualify my meager efforts as “ playing golf ”) right - handed . plus , i have an affinity for underdogs , and whenever i see a pga tournament on television it always seems like poor phil is chasing after tiger woods . <PARA> of course , phil mickelson is far from “ poor ” either as a golfer or as a money - earner , having racked up about $ 2 . 5 million in tournament winnings just in the first few months of 2008 ( and an estimated $ 52 million during the course of his pro career ). all of which makes it seem a bit strange ( if not cheap and dishonest ) that he would try to back out of paying a $ 200 , 000 wager he lost to his golfing partners , as claimed in the purported article from golfweek cited above . <PARA> just about all one really has to know about this item in order to dismiss it is that it appeared on the internet on april 1 , a fact golfweek noted in a disclaimer denying both its truthfulness and the claim that they had published it : <PARA> we all know that things written in cyberspace can take on a life of their own . there has been a “ story ” circulating across the internet the past few days with a gambling tale involving phil mickelson . it described a six - figure gambling debt incurred over a practice round with members at augusta national golf club leading into this year ’ s masters tournament . <PARA> the item was posted on a web site called golfwrx . com ( it has since been pulled ) and across the top of it read : “ from a golfweek ( sic ) insider .” this is not true . as the editor of golfweek , i can assure our readers that nobody at our magazine or web site ( golfweek . com ) had anything to do with this post , which went online ( go figure ) on april 1 . <PARA> the fact that golfweek is in no way involved with this story was pointed out to two key members of the mickelson camp on the eve of the masters . a spokesman from mickelson ’ s camp called the post “ baseless ” and “ erroneous .” <PARA> the item was posted on a web site called golfwrx . com ( it has since been pulled ) and across the top of it read : “ from a golfweek ( sic ) insider .” this is not true . as the editor of golfweek , i can assure our readers that nobody at our magazine or web site ( golfweek . com ) had anything to do with this post , which went online ( go figure ) on april 1 . <PARA> the fact that golfweek is in no way involved with this story was pointed out to two key members of the mickelson camp on the eve of the masters . a spokesman from mickelson ’ s camp called the post “ baseless ” and “ erroneous .” <PARA> joe logan , the philadelphia inquirer ‘ s golf writer , also noted in his blog that the story was merely “ an april fool ’ s hoax .”	
false	origins : there ’ s an old joke i ’ ve heard used by many a person called upon to deliver yet another generic opening speech at yet another public function , and it goes like this : “ i feel like zsa zsa gabor ’ s seventh husband on his wedding night — i know what i ’ m supposed to do ; i just don ’ t know how to make it interesting .” this is an occasion when i can understand the sentiment — how can i write about the umpteenth variation of the same rumor and have anything interesting or informative to say , something that isn ’ t a rehash of stuff i ’ ve written several times before ? <PARA> i ’ m not sure , so in this case i ’ m not going to try . i ’ ll just reiterate the same points we ’ ve made elsewhere many times over the last three years : <PARA> the new york police department has denied this rumor while ( questionably ) identifying it as a “ part of a computer virus ”: <PARA> the new york city police department has received no credible threat information concerning a widely - circulated email message that discusses a purported subway attack allegedly planned for friday , june 11th . in addition , the email is part of a computer virus which attacks the address books of its recipients and spreads by using those addresses . computer users are reminded not to open messages of from suspect or unfamiliar senders . <PARA> ( it ’ s possible this message has been re - sent by some recipients whose pcs were already infected by viruses , but we haven ’ t seen any evidence that the message itself was deliberately circulated as a way of spreading malevolent code .) <PARA> june 11 came and went without incident ; no terrorist attacks took place , and there was no news of any having been thwarted . <PARA> the essence of this message was the same as countless other similar rumors we ’ ve traced since september 11 : the world is a scary place , especially when you ’ re dealing with hidden foes who might strike anywhere , at any time . asserting that the enemy will follow a predictable pattern allows us to regain a sense of direction , to feel that we have control of our futures , to believe that we can take active steps to avoid becoming victims rather than passively awaiting our fates . what we fear most is the unknown , and these types of rumors provide us with the comfort of knowing something , even if that something proves to be bogus . whether this sort of comfort is worth the price of the false fears that usually accompany it is up to the individual to decide .	
false	origins : when the above message began circulating via e - mail forwards shortly after christmas 2002 , everyone was asking , “ is it real ?” yes , the text did in fact describe a real warning issued by the federal bureau of investigation on 29 december 2002 in which they asked the public to be on the lookout for the five men described above , whom they believed to have entered the usa illegally on 24 december 2002 , possibly from canada ; subsequent events have proved , however , that the information on which the warning was based was bad . <PARA> the five men described in the warning were said to have been part of a group of nineteen who obtained bogus travel documents in canada . fbi and white house officials wouldn ’ t directly link the five men to terrorism but said their names came to light during an anti - terrorism investigation into a passport smuggling ring . according to the fbi ’ s press release : <PARA> although the fbi has no specific information that these individuals are connected to any potential terrorist activities , based upon information developed in the course of on - going investigations , the fbi would like to locate and question these persons . <PARA> the fbi was unclear on exactly how the five men might have slipped into the country — whether they got past border security , used an illegal entry point , or employed forged passports . the five men , who were believed to be traveling on false british passports , were traced to a forger in pakistan with links to al - qaida who has helped funnel other people into the united states , knight ridder newspapers <PARA> reported . <PARA> a few days after the alert was issued , a pakistani jeweler named mohammed asghar came forward and claimed that the picture of “ mustafa khan owasi ” was actually a photograph of him , that he had never been to the usa , and that a passport forger who had crafted a phony visa for him had re - used his picture without his knowledge . <PARA> fbi officials later admitted that the information on which the warning had been based , provided by a forgery suspect held in police custody in canada and awaiting extradition to the u . s ., was probably fabricated and called off the search . michael john hamdani , who is in police custody in canada , passed an initial canadian polygraph test when he reported the alleged illegal entries , but officials said they were not convinced he told the truth after further investigation turned up discrepancies in his story . <PARA> additional information : <PARA> fbi press release	
true	origins : in the wake of the september 11 terrorist attacks on the u . s ., public sentiment ran high for honoring firefighters and their valiant service in a difficult and dangerous job with the <PARA> establishment of a national firefighters day . in fact , a national firefighters day had already been <PARA> proclaimed by executive order at least twice in recent years , in 1991 by president bush and again in 1993 by president clinton . neither of these proclamations established a permanent , annual day of honor for firefighters , however . <PARA> the two e - mail petitions quoted above both began to circulate shortly after september 11 , the second started out by connor geraghty , the son of edward geraghty , a battalion chief with the new york city fire department who lost his life in the world trade center attacks on september 11 . both suffered from some of the usual pitfalls of internet petitions : the e - mail account listed in the first petition was quickly shut down , and the flood of responses frequently filled up connor geraghty ’ s mailbox <PARA> and caused incoming messages to bounce . connor ’ s petition did serve the purpose of calling wider attention to his cause : his mother forwarded it to new york congresswoman carolyn mccarthy , who in turn read a tribute to connor and edward geraghty into the congressional record . <PARA> as far as we know , no legislative effort has yet been undertaken to establish a national firefighters day . also , according to a november 2001 new york post article , “ connor initially wanted firefighters day to be held on sept . 11 , but now he thinks that date should be reserved for all sorts of heroes . firefighters , he firmly believes , deserve another day all their own .” <PARA> for those still interested in establishing a national firefighters day , sponsoring a petition on the web rather than via e - mail is much more practical . also , taking a few extra minutes to send letters to congressional representatives rather than simply adding names to an e - petition would be a worthwhile effort .	
false	origins : no , cnn did not air decade - old footage of palestinians dancing in the streets . eason jordan , cnn ’ s chief news executive , confirmed that the video used on cnn was in fact shot on tuesday , 11 september 2001 , in east jerusalem by a reuters tv crew , not during the persian gulf conflict of 1990 - 91 — a fact proved by its inclusion of comments from a palestinian praising osama bin laden ( whose name was unlikely to have come up ten years earlier in connection with the invasion and liberation of kuwait ) as well as the appearance in the video of post - 1991 automobiles . the person who made the claim quoted above has since recanted . <PARA> ( the argument that the footage cnn used could not possibly be real because it showed palestinians in broad daylight not long after the attack — even though palestinian territory is several time zones ahead of new york — is not valid . eastern daylight time in the united states is six hours behind the area of the middle east referred to as palestine . thus , when the first attack occurred in new york just before 9 : 00 a . m ., palestine time would have been 3 : 00 p . m ., and the area would still have been bathed in plenty of mid - afternoon sunlight .) <PARA> reuters , the international news agency whose camera crew shot the footage , issued the following statement : <PARA> reuters rejects as utterly baseless an allegation being circulated by e - mail and the internet claiming that it circulated 10 - year - old videotape to illustrate palestinians celebrating in the wake of the september 11 tragedies in the united states . <PARA> reuters welcomes a statement by the universidad estatal de campinas - brasil ( unicamp ), one of whose students was the author of the original e - mail , setting the record straight . <PARA> the videotape in question was shot in east jerusalem by a reuters camera crew on september 11 in the immediate aftermath of the attacks on the united states . the footage was broadcast by cnn and other subscribers to the reuters video news service . <PARA> reuters welcomes a statement by the universidad estatal de campinas - brasil ( unicamp ), one of whose students was the author of the original e - mail , setting the record straight . <PARA> the videotape in question was shot in east jerusalem by a reuters camera crew on september 11 in the immediate aftermath of the attacks on the united states . the footage was broadcast by cnn and other subscribers to the reuters video news service . <PARA> said cnn of the matter : <PARA> there is absolutely no truth to the information that is now distributed on the internet that cnn used 10 - year - old video when showing the celebrating of some palestinians in east jerusalem after the terror attacks in the u . s . the video was shot that day by a reuters camera crew . cnn is a client of reuters and like other clients , received the video and broadcast it . reuters officials have publicly made the facts clear as well . <PARA> the allegation is false . the source of the allegation has withdrawn it and apologized . it was started by a brazilian student who now says he immediately posted a correction once he knew the information was not true . this is the statement by his university — unicamp — universidad estatal de campinas - brasil . <PARA> official statement by universidad de campinas - brasil <PARA> 17 / 09 / 01 <PARA> unicamp ( universidad estatal de campinas - brasil ) would like to announce that it has no knowledge of a videotape from 1991 , whose images supposedly aired on cnn showing palestinians celebrating the terrorist attacks in the u . s . the tape was supposedly from 1991 , and there were rumors that the images were passed off as current . <PARA> this information was later denied , as soon as it proved false , by márcio a . v . carvalho , a student at unicamp . he approached the administration today , 17 . 09 . 2001 , to clarify the following : <PARA> the information he got , verbally , was that a professor from another institution ( not from unicamp ) had the tape ; <PARA> he sent the information to a discussion group e - mail list ; <PARA> many people from this list were interested in the subject and requested more details ; <PARA> he again contacted the person who first gave him the information and the person denied having the tape ;

( actually , the invasion of kuwait by iraq took place in 1990 , and it ’ s unlikely anyone captured images of palestinians “ celebrating ” that event . if cnn had used similar footage , it probably came from the palestinian reaction to iraq ’ s launching of missiles at israel during the persian gulf war in 1991 .) <PARA> subsequent rumors that the “ israeli defense agency ” sent a film crew to hand out candy to palestinians in order to induce them into staging a “ celebration ” for the cameras appear to be equally unfounded . however , this issue does emphasize a point that appears to have been overlooked in the debate over whether video was re - used from a previous year or not : that images themselves are not the whole story . a news report can be accompanied by stock footage and still be fair and accurate , but a news report accompanied by current footage is not necessarily either fair or accurate . a simple news clip doesn ’ t always provide us with enough context to discern what the people depicted in it are reacting to , why they ’ re reacting the way they are , or whether their actions are representative of a large group of people or a very small one , as an italian journalist in beirut reported : <PARA> trying to find our bearings , my husband and i went into an american - style cafe in the hamra district , near rue verdun , rated as one of the most expensive shopping streets in the world . here the cognitive dissonance was immediate , and direct . the cafe ’ s sophisticated clientele was celebrating , laughing , cheering and making jokes , as waiters served hamburgers and diet pepsi . nobody looked shocked , or moved . they were excited , very excited . <PARA> an hour later , at a little market near the u . s . embassy , on the outskirts of beirut , a thrilled shop assistant showed us , using his hands , how the plane had crashed into the twin towers . he , too , was laughing . <PARA> once back at the house where we were staying , we started scanning the international channels . soon came reports of palestinians celebrating . the bbc reporter in jerusalem said it was only a tiny minority . astonished , we asked some moderate arabs if that was the case . “ nonsense ,” said one , speaking for many . “ ninety percent of the arab world believes that americans got what they deserved .” <PARA> an exaggeration ? rather an understatement . a couple of days later , we headed north to tripoli , near the syrian border . on the way , we read that palestinian leader yasser arafat , who donated blood in front of the cameras , was rejecting any suggestion that his people were rejoicing over the terrorist attack . “ it was less than 10 children in jerusalem ,” he said . <PARA> an hour later , at a little market near the u . s . embassy , on the outskirts of beirut , a thrilled shop assistant showed us , using his hands , how the plane had crashed into the twin towers . he , too , was laughing . <PARA> once back at the house where we were staying , we started scanning the international channels . soon came reports of palestinians celebrating . the bbc reporter in jerusalem said it was only a tiny minority . astonished , we asked some moderate arabs if that was the case . “ nonsense ,” said one , speaking for many . “ ninety percent of the arab world believes that americans got what they deserved .” <PARA> an exaggeration ? rather an understatement . a couple of days later , we headed north to tripoli , near the syrian border . on the way , we read that palestinian leader yasser arafat , who donated blood in front of the cameras , was rejecting any suggestion that his people were rejoicing over the terrorist attack . “ it was less than 10 children in jerusalem ,” he said .	
mixture	origins : the little satirical poem quoted above — penned in response to the september 11 attacks on america and based on dr . seuss ’ classic children ’ s story , “ the grinch who stole christmas ” — has garnered a great deal of attention : npr and cnn have covered it , the new yorker printed an excerpt , several city newspapers and untold numbers of radio stations have performed their own readings which are being passed around in mp3 format , and wcbs - tv in new york city even produced a filmed version . <PARA> the poem is correctly attributed to rob suggs , an author , illustrator and humorist living in atlanta , georgia . however , mr . suggs is not associated with children ’ s healthcare of atlanta , nor did he write “ the binch ” for children . he created the piece for the enjoyment of a few adult friends , and amidst the chain of e - mail forwards someone added the preface with its erroneous explanatory information : <PARA> this wasn ’ t a grand gesture , a premeditated desire to minister to children , or an effort to speak to america through cyberspace . it was a parody that i spent ten minutes writing after considering the mythic parallels between dr . seuss ’ character and this horrific contemporary figure who was suddenly thrust like a dagger into the middle of our national psyche . . . i merely wrote the verse for a few adult friends on the net , not children — not even my own kids , who are 8 and 10 . i tossed it off without even adding my name , and i had no expectation of forwarding . <PARA> in the words of mr . suggs , “ i love dr . seuss and hope the poem will direct people back to his wonderful work — in addition , of course , to providing us with a literary reference point we <PARA> can find comforting and encouraging in a time of terrible national crisis .” <PARA> additional information :

false	origins : after a satirical ( and fictitious ) mariah carey “ interview ” appeared on the internet in a web publication called cupcake in early 1996 , the damaging sentence cited above was lifted from it <PARA> and quoted in vox magazine ( a british culture / movie / music publication ), from which the british newspaper the independent picked up the story in may . the quote spread like wildfire on internet newsgroups beginning in june , and by august the quote was being reprinted ( without question or verification ) by dozens of newspapers and magazines throughout the world ( including ms . magazine and the san francisco chronicle ‘ s usually reliable columnist herb caen ). the quote was frequently attributed by news reports as having been uttered by ms . carey in an interview with the uk ’ s radio 1 ( as reprinted in the british publication the face , a style / fashion magazine ) or on the world entertainment news network , and although debunkings of the story appeared in print as early as july , the fictitious quote was still being spread as true by the media into september . <PARA> ordinarily such obviously satirical material doesn ’ t gain such widespread currency , but sometimes it does when it strikes a particularly resonant chord with the public , as this quote did — perhaps because it embodied widespread perceptions of the insensitivity of thin people towards the non - thin , and the callous attitude of the wealthy towards the poverty - stricken . if either of these were the main point that caused the legend to be so easily believed and spread , however , the subject of the rumor would most likely have been someone such as ultra - thin model kate moss or wealthy and stylish marla maples trump , not mariah carey . the association of this quotation with carey would seem to be another instance of the “ celebrity is not what he / she appears to be ” legend type , a weapon usually launched at people who , in the public ’ s perception , have come to fame and fortune in too facile a manner .

true	origins : given how often we ’ ve been asked about the validity of the #- 9 - 0 telephone scam over the years — even though that scam doesn ’ t affect the ordinary residential or cell phone <PARA> customer — it ’ s surprising we ’ ve received so few inquiries about a call forwarding scam which can be effectively pulled on a large segment of the phone - using public . a recent resurgence of this scam in some parts of the u . s . has prompted us to put up this article to increase awareness and help head off additional instances of this con . <PARA> the call forwarding scam typically starts out with the scammer ’ s calling a victim and pretending to be in an urgent situation with a desperate need to contact someone else . a typical scenario is that the scammer claims to have been arrested for a minor traffic infraction ( such as having outstanding warrants for unpaid tickets or driving with a suspended license ) and needs to call a relative to come pick up his children from the police station . supposedly , the scammer has “ accidentally ” dialed the wrong number and claims he cannot place another call ( usually by invoking the myth that arrested persons are allowed only a single phone call ), so he pleads with the victim to help him complete the call by forwarding him to the correct phone number . <PARA> however , the forwarding instructions provided by the scammer don ’ t simply forward the current call to another number ; they set the victim ’ s phone to forward all subsequent incoming calls to another number . this scheme allows the scammer to use his victim ’ s phone as a relay for long - distance calls , with the victim being none the wiser until he spots the unusual charges on his next phone <PARA> bill . <PARA> for example , suppose the victim ’ s phone number is 345 - 1234 , and the scammer has a cell phone with the number 890 - 6789 . the scammer may instruct the victim to “ dial * 72 and then 890 - 6789 ,” a sequence which activates the call - forwarding feature for the victim ’ s phone number and tells the phone company to forward all calls placed to 345 - 1234 to 890 - 6789 instead . the scammer can then instruct acquaintances all over the world to call him collect at 345 - 1234 ( or to place third - party calls to anywhere in the world and bill them to 345 - 1234 ) — the scammer can approve all these charges ( because all calls placed to 345 - 1234 are being forwarded to his phone ), but the owner of 345 - 1234 is the one on the hook for paying for them ( because they were forwarded through his number ). the forwarding will continue until the victim issues instructions to cancel it ; if the victim doesn ’ t receive many incoming calls , he may not even notice something is amiss until he receives his next phone bill and spots the unauthorized charges for hundreds ( or thousands ) of dollars . <PARA> as at & t explains the scam : <PARA> star - 7 - 2 , billing back to you : you receive a call from a stranger posing as a telephone technician or telling you that he has been arrested for driving with a suspended license and is in jail — or is in a situation that requires your immediate help . “ i need to reach my wife and tell her what happened so she can pick up our two kids . would you dial * 72 and then her number ?” <PARA> star - 7 - 2 is a custom feature for call forwarding . when the customer dials * 72 followed by a telephone number , it activates the call forwarding feature causing all your incoming calls to ring at another number . at the end of the other line — whether calls have been forwarded to a landline , a cell phone or a payphone — the original caller ’ s partner - in - crime is able to accept all collect and third - party calls , while telling your own legitimate callers that they have the wrong number . you get billed for all calls made because your number is the one from which they are forwarded . this ingenious scam , which even overrides cell phones inability to get collect calls , may go on for several days before you become aware it has occurred . <PARA> star - 7 - 2 is a custom feature for call forwarding . when the customer dials * 72 followed by a telephone number , it activates the call forwarding feature causing all your incoming calls to ring at another number . at the end of the other line — whether calls have been forwarded to a landline , a cell phone or a payphone — the original caller ’ s partner - in - crime is able to accept all collect and third - party calls , while telling your own legitimate callers that they have the wrong number . you get billed for all calls made because your number is the one from which they are forwarded . this ingenious scam , which even overrides cell phones inability to get collect calls , may go on for several days before you become aware it has occurred . <PARA> ( of course , this scheme only works if the victim had previously signed up for the call - forwarding option with his phone service provider . and although * 72 is the sequence most commonly used for call forwarding , some phone service providers may use different sequences .) <PARA> the best way to avoid falling victim to this scam is the obvious one : never activate your call forwarding feature at the request of someone you don ’ t know . only forward your calls when you want them to go somewhere else .

false	origins : while it is true the bush administration is working on an accord that would allow some mexican citizens to claim benefits from the u . s . social security system , two of the key points in the above message — that this accord will apply to mexicans who worked in the usa illegally , and that the accord can be nullified through the passage of a bill currently before congress ( hr219 ) — are <PARA> wrong . <PARA> the totalization plan now under discussion between the bush administration and the mexican government ( both parties still describe the discussions as “ informal and preliminary ”) would allow mexican citizens who paid into the u . s . social security fund while legally employed in the usa to collect the benefits they accrued even if they return to their homeland . mexicans who labored in the u . s . legally and who paid into the u . s . social security plan would no longer be penalized for having gone back to their country of citizenship , nor would they lose retirement benefits because , having split their working lives across two countries , they failed to meet the minimum requirements of either country ’ s social security system . <PARA> totalization is nothing new , nor does it apply only to workers from mexico . the united states has been negotiating such agreements with other governments since the late 1970s and currently has them in place with twenty other countries . these agreements allow workers to “ totalize ” the number of years they have toiled in both countries to meet the minimum number of years required to qualify for benefits in one of the systems . <PARA> many immigrants ( from mexico and elsewhere ) enter the usa illegally and manage to secure jobs with the aid of forged or borrowed documents . some of these immigrants go on to become legal residents , and it is these formerly illegal workers who are the subject of u . s . representative ( from texas ) ron paul ’ s concerns , because at least one mexican official has stated he hoped that if there were a totalization agreement between the u . s . and mexico , benefits could be adjusted upward for now - legal mexican workers who once labored in the united states illegally and paid into the system using false social security numbers . however , that a mexical official may have such a scheme on his wish list doesn ’ t mean that the u . s . plans to implement it , and the logistics of managing such a scheme would tend to rule against it . how could now - legal workers be matched to payments they made years earlier under false social security numbers ? and if the formerly illegal workers couldn ’ t be matched to their payments , how would anyone know how much benefit ( if any ) each of those workers had accrued ? without the checks and balances inherent to a “ one number per one guy ” system , the potential for fraud would be limitless . <PARA> ( it ’ s easy to misread the comments from rep . paul quoted above as applying to mexican laborers who continue to work in the u . s . illegally , but that isn ’ t the issue being addressed . undocumented mexican workers who toil in the u . s . aren ’ t part of the equation , although the spectre of a clamoring horde of illegals overwhelming the u . s . social security system is broadly hinted at in this “ let ’ s defend social security !” piece . those who continue to work in the u . s . illegally would have no recourse for claiming social security benefits under the accord as currently envisioned .) <PARA> a totalization agreement with mexico would cover mexican citizens who worked in the usa legally and afterwards moved back to their homeland . the details of the accord — how much of a benefit they would be entitled to , how long they ’ d have had to have worked in either country , whether the scale of payments made to beneficiaries would conform to u . s . or mexican retirement plans — haven ’ t been released yet . however , it ’ s reasonable to assume those charged with managing the social security totalization accord would engineer the agreement in such a way as to head off easily foreseeable abuse , cutting off at the knees the blood - boiling notion of former illegals working in the usa for all of two weeks then forever afterwards sucking the american public ’ s tit . <PARA> at its heart , the question of a social security totalization agreement with mexico is one of raw economics . about 94 , 000 beneficiaries living abroad are serviced under the twenty agreements that now exist with other countries . a mexican agreement could bring another 162 , 000 into the fold in just the first five years , and one independent estimate put the total potential expenditure at $ 1 billion a year . that is a large sum , yet one that begins to fall into context when measured against the $ 372 billion in social security benefits currently being paid to 46 . 4 million recipients . even so , inking such an agreement with mexico would place a further strain on social security resources , including the staffing of positions to administer the additional claims and possibly the erection of a new building . ( the $ 1 billion a year in social security benefits themselves shouldn ’ t really be counted in this assessment , because those are monies owed to legal workers who ’ ve been paying into the plan . that they are mexicans who have gone back to mexico doesn ’ t change that it was their money all along , and the u . s . has been holding onto it .) <PARA> the attempt to tie rep . paul ’ s proposed hr219 bill to a statement against a totalization agreement with mexico is also misleading . the social security preservation act of 2003 which rep . paul introduced in the house on 7 january 2003 seeks “ to amend title ii of the social security act to ensure the integrity of the social security trust funds by requiring the managing trustee to invest the annual surplus of such trust funds in marketable interest - bearing obligations of the united states and certificates of deposit in depository institutions insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation , and to protect such trust funds from the public debt limit ” — in other words , it ’ s a plan to stop the federal government from borrowing against social security ’ s annual surplus revenue to fund other government programs ( a favorite scheme for balancing deficit budgets ). nothing in the text of hr219 has anything to do with totalization agreements in general or a totalization agreement with mexico in particular . ( indeed , the current hr219 couldn ’ t possibly have anything to do with the totalization accord with mexico now being worked on by the bush administration , because it ’ s simply a re - introduction of a bill first submitted to congress on 3 january 2001 — well before work began on the planned accord , and more than two weeks before president bush even took office !) americans who heed the message quoted above are therefore being stampeded into badgering their congressional representatives to support h . r . 219 for reasons that have nothing to do with the content of that bill . <PARA> barbara “ sticky wicket ” mikkelson <PARA> additional information :	
true	origins : on 2 june 2003 the five commissioners of the federal communications commission will meet to discuss , and likely enact , staff - recommended changes to fcc policy regarding limitations on conglomerate ownership of media outlets . <PARA> although a comprehensive list of those changes hasn ’ t been released to the public , various statements by fcc insiders and spokespeople have served to supply a relatively reliable index of what those changes will be . there is a plan to lift a ban on ownership of newspapers and broadcast stations in large markets . at the moment , companies which already own a newspaper in one market cannot purchase a second one or buy a television or radio station there . ( a handful of dual ownerships do exist , but those were grandfathered in because those double holdings preceded the ban .) the stricture would be lifted in medium and large markets but would remain in effect in smaller markets , with a ( controversial ) fcc formula known as the “ diversity index ” being employed to measure consumers ’ use of various media outlets in any given market . <PARA> according to the e - mail exhortation to oppose the fcc ’ s plans : <PARA> the rules change could allow your local tv stations , newspaper , radio stations , and cable provider to all be owned by one company . <PARA> that does not seem to be the case . the fcc appears determined to maintain diversity in all media markets , large and small . in the smaller ones , the fcc will keep the ban in place to protect against the possibility of any city ’ s news all coming from one source . in larger markets , although some business entities will end up owning two or three media outlets , the fcc expects the markets will continue to be served by a number of other media sources , thus maintaining a mix of news choices for the people who live in those areas . <PARA> another of the fcc ’ s plans is to ease caps on the number of television stations a company can own . the current cap restricts companies such as viacom ( corporate parent of cbs ) and general electric ( corporate parent of nbc ) to owning tv stations which reach a total of no more than 35 percent of the nation ’ s tv households ; under the new plan , this limit would be raised to 45 percent . <PARA> the ban against mergers between the top four networks will be maintained , which is contrary to what is stated in another part of the e - mail inciting opposition to the changes : <PARA> nbc , abc , cbs and fox could have the same corporate parent . <PARA> the fcc says it is making these changes to keep pace with changing times . the earlier strictures — which worked in the days before cable networks and the internet had taken as large a bite as they have out of the pool of available television viewership — are outdated , the fcc maintains . <PARA> yet despite the fcc ’ s assurances , grave doubts have been expressed — both by those within the journalistic community and those outside it — regarding the effect these changes will have on the public ’ s access to information , competition within the news field , and the quality of journalism itself . without the cross - ownership ban , experts worry that newspapers would fall under the influence of large tv station groups or media conglomerates such as aol time warner inc ., viacom inc ., or news corp ., any ( or all ) of which might emphasize entertainment and profit over journalism and community service . “ convergence may be good for media companies , but it ’ s bad for journalism ,” said robert haiman , president emeritus of the poynter institute for media studies . <PARA> although on 2 june 2003 the fcc commissioners voted , as expected , to loosen media ownership regulations , their efforts were blocked by legislation passed by the house of representatives on 23 july 2003 . <PARA> on 2 june 2003 the fcc voted 3 - 2 to adopt the proposed changes .	
true	origins : this is one of those items that seems simple enough to verify at first blush , but proves quite difficult in practice . <PARA> first of all , we have to consider what our parameters are : <PARA> even deciding that we ’ re only going to consider the postions various countries took on resolutions presented to the general assembly during a specified time period still makes compiling an accurate tally difficult , because : <PARA> once we narrow our focus to resolutions submitted to a recorded vote , we still have some thorny issues to consider : <PARA> since we had to start somewhere , we tallied the recorded votes for all resolutions put before the general assembly so far during the current session , running from october 2003 to mid - april 2004 . we counted all votes , whether they involved adopting resolutions as a whole or making alterations to draft resolutions . when countries abstained or otherwise failed to vote , we counted them as voting neither for nor against the u . s . likewise , when the u . s . abstained from voting on resolutions , we did not include other countries ’ votes on those resolutions in our totals . <PARA> the results of this tally were even worse ( from a u . s . perspective ) than the message quoted above indicates , with the countries named voting contrary to the u . s . position on u . n . resolutions an aggregate 88 % of the time . ( even though india is neither arab nor particularly islamic , we included it in our chart because the widely - circulated e - mailed list did .) <PARA> however , we also surveyed the u . n . voting records of several countries generally considered to be close allies of the u . s ., and those results were none too impressive either . only israel consistently voted with the u . s .: <PARA> how much significance one should place in these figures is problematic , because most other u . n . member states have records of voting against the u . s . that are equally as bad as the records of the countries named in the message above . u . n . votes on resolutions are frequently lopsided , pitting a single nation or a handful of nations against all the others , and more often than not the u . s . is the one nation at odds with the rest of the world . of the 83 resolutions we surveyed for our informal tally , in ten cases the u . s . was the only member state to vote against them , and in five cases only one other nation joined the u . s . in voting against them . in fact , in over half the total cases ( 42 out of 83 ), the u . s . was supported by five or fewer member states in voting against a u . n . resolution . so it isn ’ t just the arab / islamic states who consistently vote against the u . s . in the united nations — pretty much the rest of the world does , too .	
true	origins : in 2002 , frank p . williamson , a retired chemical engineer , spent $ 3 , 000 <PARA> to purchase 300 16 - by - 20 - inch framed posters displaying the motto “ in god we trust ” in large white letters over the red , white , and blue colors of the american flag . mr . williamson donated the posters for display in public buildings ( city halls , schools , libraries , police stations , and post offices ) throughout montgomery county , texas , saying : “ after the terrorist attacks on 9 / 11 , i thought it would be good to promote our national motto . i know that the only reason we ’ ve been successful in the past is that our forefathers put their trust in god way back .” <PARA> in november 2002 , a united states postal service ( usps ) supervisor ordered the removal of these posters from the lobbies of government - owned post offices in several montgomery county towns ( including montgomery , dobbin , and willis ) because they “ did not fit within postal guidelines ,” citing a usps regulation prohibiting the “ depositing or posting of handbills , flyers , pamphlets , signs , posters , placards , or other literature ( except official postal and other governmental notices and announcements ) in interior public areas on postal premises .” ( a small post office north of houston was allowed to keep its poster on display after a supervisor determined that the office was a privately - run contract facility and was therefore not subject to the same “ facility standards ” as government - owned post offices .) <PARA> the united states ’ use of a national motto with a religious reference despite the first amendment ’ s prohibition against congress ’ making any “ law respecting an establishment of religion ” remains <PARA> a contentious issue . “ in god we trust ” was established as the national motto of the united states through a law ( 36 u . s . c . section 186 ) passed by congress in 1956 , and two federal statutes require its use on all u . s . coins and currency . three federal appeals courts have heard cases ( most recently in 1996 ) challenging the constitutionality of the mandated appearance of “ in god we trust ” on coinage and currency , but all these cases have so far been unsuccessful . ( the united states supreme court has not yet decided a case challenging the constitutionality of the national motto .) the precedent remains the ruling handed down by the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit in 1970 , that “ it is quite obvious that the national motto and the slogan on coinage and currency , ‘ in god we trust ’, has nothing whatsoever to do with the establishment of religion . its use is of a patriotic or ceremonial character and bears no true resemblance to a governmental sponsorship of a religious exercise .”

( the first true bugs bunny cartoon had been released in 1940 .) the plot involves elmer fudd ’ s receiving ( when he has just cornered bugs during a rabbit hunt ) a telegram informing him he stands to inherit $ 3 million from his uncle louie , but only if he does not “ hurt any animals — especially rabbits .” predictably , bugs seizes the opportunity presented by this development by moving in with elmer , and hilarity ensures as man and hare try to live together , particularly when elmer receives notice that after deductions for taxes and attorney ’ s fees , he actually owes his uncle ’ s executors $ 1 . 98 . <PARA> at about the 2 : 57 mark of the cartoon ( just after bugs steps out from inside a shower - curtained bathtub ), the towel around the rabbit ’ s midsection slips down a bit , revealing what some have claimed is the tip of a bunny phallus as shown in this still frame : <PARA> no prankery on the part of animators is needed to explain this imagery , however . the object of curiosity is simply the gap between bugs ’ legs ( just below his torso ); the whiteness of the bathtub behind him and the curvature of the towel combine to produce an area that suggests the tip of a phallus .	
mixture	way back in the olden days of 2007 , readers were asking us about this much - circulated bit of helpful advice concerning automobile fuel level displays : <PARA> as anyone who has driven a rental car well knows , it is indeed useful to have some sort of indicator on the instrument panel that reveals which side to refuel on . sadly , “ the world ’ s best kept auto secret ” ( as the e - mail was often titled ) was a bit of misinformation or a misunderstanding : while the indicator it described was real , the “ the world ’ s best kept auto secret ” message misidentified its nature . <PARA> the nozzle - and - hose side of the fuel level ( or “ low fuel ”) indicator , which is usually presented as an icon depicting a gas pump , doesn ’ t consistently correspond with the side of the car where the fuel door is to be found , nor does its placement on the instrument array ( left side versus right side ) tell whether you should bring the passenger ’ s or driver ’ s side up next to the pumps at your local gas station . <PARA> there ’ s no magic to it . although “ the world ’ s best kept auto secret ” will prove true for some vehicles , it won ’ t for others , it ’ s akin to the many folkloric “ tests ” for determining an unborn child ’ s sex , it has only two outcomes ( the icon ’ s nozzle - and - hose side and the side the vehicle ’ s fuel door is on match or they don ’ t ), so this “ secret ” will work sometimes but not always . ( yes , we know that some vehicles have their fuel doors in the back , but there are so few of them that for the purpose of this discussion we might as well ignore that possibility .) <PARA> the fuel icons in modern cars do inform drivers which side to refuel on , but it ’ s not the placement or shape of the fuel icon that carries that information : nearly all newer models of automobiles include a small arrow or triangle next to the fuel icon that indicates which side of the vehicle bears the fuel door . as seen in the graphic example displayed below , sometimes the arrow and fuel handle are on opposite sides of the icon ; it ’ s the former , not the latter , that signifies where the gas cap is : <PARA> there ’ s no agreement among auto manufacturers as to which side the gas cap should be on ( which , if they would just choose one side or the other , would solve the whole problem right there : you ’ d then always know which side of your vehicle to park closest to the pump ). it would make more sense to consistently position the aperture on the passenger ’ s side , both because it ’ s easier to get out of your vehicle when you don ’ t have to weasel your bulk past the gas pump you ’ ve just parked next to , and because should you run out of gas on the highway , it ’ s a lot safer to pour more in when you ’ re not standing next to the traffic whizzing by you . <PARA> an argument can also be made for placing the gas cap on the rear of vehicles . were it there , you would no longer need be concerned about getting any particular side of your car sidled up to the pump : provided the rear of the vehicle were somewhat close to the refueling array , it wouldn ’ t matter if the gas pump island were to the left or the right . <PARA> yet another solution would be to have two fuel entry doors , one on each side . that notion , however , fails on cost . according to rick asher , a spokesman for general motors , the cost of putting a gas cap on both sides of a vehicle would far exceed the value of the added convenience for the vast majority of people . <PARA> which leaves us right back where we started , which is having to make mental note of which side a vehicle ’ s fuel door is on when driving rentals or other cars unfamiliar to us ( or try checking the side - view mirrors to see where it is before pulling up to the pumps ).	
false	origins : the item quoted above is an excerpt from the 20 may 2002 israelinsider article “ why i won ’ t be seeing the fjords this summer ,” by bennett m . epstein , a new york criminal defense lawyer . mr . epstein , prompted by a recent decision by “ some [ norwegian ] supermarket chains . . . to place special identification stickers on products from israel ” as a protest over israeli actions in the palestinian conflict , condemns norway for a variety of anti - semitic and anti - israel behaviors . <PARA> the issue we ’ re addressing here is not the validity of mr . epstein ’ s charges , but simply the claim that prompted his article : the issue of whether some norwegian supermarket chains have really decided to place special identification stickers on products from israel . <PARA> on 5 april 2002 , the jerusalem post reported that coop norge , norway ’ s second - largest supermarket chain , had opted to boycott israeli products as a protest over israel ’ s actions in their conflict with the palestinian authority : <PARA> coop norge , part of a scandinavian wide chain of food stores , is the first foreign company to impose a boycott on israel during the current conflict , a threat rarely used since the arab secondary boycott was lifted following the signing of the 1993 oslo accords . <PARA> “ coop norge ’ s directors are upset over the way the israelis are acting in the conflict ,” managing director bernt aas told a norwegian daily , according to bloomberg l . p . the chain hoped its swedish and danish sister organizations would also impose sanctions . “ israel isn ’ t a big import country for us , but a boycott has great symbolic value ,” aas said . <PARA> according to agrexco , the largest agricultural exporter , israel sells avocadoes , cherry tomatoes , peppers , tomatoes , citrus fruits , carrots , melons , strawberries , celery , and chinese cabbage to coop norge , whose purchases account for about 6 percent of israel ’ s annual norwegian exports of 8 million eur and 3 % of its overall scandinavian exports of 30 million eur . <PARA> “ coop norge ’ s directors are upset over the way the israelis are acting in the conflict ,” managing director bernt aas told a norwegian daily , according to bloomberg l . p . the chain hoped its swedish and danish sister organizations would also impose sanctions . “ israel isn ’ t a big import country for us , but a boycott has great symbolic value ,” aas said . <PARA> according to agrexco , the largest agricultural exporter , israel sells avocadoes , cherry tomatoes , peppers , tomatoes , citrus fruits , carrots , melons , strawberries , celery , and chinese cabbage to coop norge , whose purchases account for about 6 percent of israel ’ s annual norwegian exports of 8 million eur and 3 % of its overall scandinavian exports of 30 million eur . <PARA> however , an announcement posted on the coop norge web site the same day said : <PARA> thursday ’ s message in media that said coop norway was going to boycott fruit and vegetables from israel , is not correct . <PARA> together with coop sweden and coop denmark ( coop nordic ) it has been decided not to boycott israel , but follow national and international standings in regard to the question of israeli boycott . there will therefore be no one -

sided coop boycott . <PARA> the nordic cooperatives will support any initiative that will stop the violence and secure the peace in the middle east . <PARA> additionally , again according to the jerusalem post , one other supermarket chain in norway decided not to boycott israeli products completely , but to prominently identify them with special labels : <PARA> a second norwegian supermarket chain , rema 1000 international as , has a novel way of expressing its displeasure with israel ’ s policies that conjures up the most distasteful memories . <PARA> rather than outright banning israeli products , rema 1000 , according to foreign ministry officials , intends to mark israeli products clearly , so that consumers will be able to decide whether or not to purchase them . <PARA> one foreign ministry official had a cynical suggestion , “ maybe they ’ ll mark it with a yellow star of david .” <PARA> rather than outright banning israeli products , rema 1000 , according to foreign ministry officials , intends to mark israeli products clearly , so that consumers will be able to decide whether or not to purchase them . <PARA> one foreign ministry official had a cynical suggestion , “ maybe they ’ ll mark it with a yellow star of david .” <PARA> imported food products sold in norway are generally already labelled with the country of origin , however , and none of the major norwegian grocery chains actually went through with any scheme to single them out for marking in a more predominant fashion . <PARA> the final result was that some norwegian grocers , dissatisfied with israel ’ s political stance , made grumbling noises about planning to boycott or slap special labels on israeli food imports , but within a few days they had all reconsidered and decided to address their dissatisfaction through other means . an american writer jumped the gun and editorialized on the issue without verifying whether the grocers had ever followed through on their threats .

unproven	in another case of a quote reflecting what many people want to believe — in this case that president bush is an appallingly ignorantracist with little understanding of the world outside the usa — we have a current example : a claim that bush asked of brazilian president fernando henrique cardoso , “ do you have blacks , too ?”, before his national security advisor helpfully stepped in to bail him out of an extremely embarrassing situation : <PARA> this item originated with an article entitled “ an overwhelming ignorance ” published in the brazilian newspaper estado de sao paulo on 28 april 2002 , and it gained wider prominence after it was picked up in the 19 may 2002 issue of the german news magazine der spiegel ( an english translation is provided on gwbush . com ). <PARA> is it true ? bush and cardoso did meet in the oval office back in november 2001 to discuss terrorism - related issues ( a meeting that was attended by national security advisor condoleezza rice ), and they held a trade meeting at the white house on 30 march 2001 . but this single - source item is woefully short of specifics , such as which meeting this quote supposedly came from , in what context bush posed his question , or who reported what bush purportedly asked . ( many readers have inferred that information about bush ’ s embarrassing question came from president cardoso himself because this item has been coupled with cardoso ’ s statement about bush ’ s still being in a “ learning phase ” regarding latin america , but cardoso was not referring to this item when he made that statement .) <PARA> considering that this news wasn ’ t reported until five to thirteen months after the event , we have to wonder whether the person reporting it was actually present for the occasion . ( indeed , the literal english text of bush ’ s question as printed in estado de sao paulo — “ do you have blacks , also ?” — bears the marks of non - english speakers who typically write ‘ also ’ where english speakers more commonly use ‘ too .’) as it turns out , the estado de sao paulo article was authored by fernando pedreira , and as the washington post noted : <PARA> this items sounds like , at best , a second - hand account recounted months after the fact , one which to many seems a little too perfectly ironic in that , of all the people present at the meeting , it has condoleezza rice intervening and fixing up bush ’ s embarrassing inquiry ( a black woman with superior knowledge coming to the aid of a “ racist ” white man in trouble ). it ’ s also more than a bit reminiscent of a joke told about vice - president dan quayle in 1989 : that quayle said , “ i was recently on a tour of latin america , and the only regret i have was that i didn ’ t study latin harder in school so i could converse with those people .” ( the essence of the joke was soon put into quayle ’ s mouth when it quickly mutated into a claim that he actually had said those words , and the joke has been widely cited as a “ real ” quote ever since ). <PARA> of course , it ’ s also possible that bush did speak the words attributed to him but that he intended them to carry a different meaning than the commonly - assumed one ( especially since bush is not known for being a particularly good extemporaneous speaker , and the situation was likely complicated by the fact that most of his audience was probably not native english - speaking ). he might have meant , for example : “ do you have [ problems with racism involving ] blacks [ in brazil ], too ?” ( that may be a bit of a stretch , but the point is to illustrate that short quotes offered out of context can often be presented in a way that implies a meaning quite different than the intended one .) <PARA> so , what this issues boils down to is a non - specific , single - source item , one which the washington post has the white house dismissing as “ total crap .” lacking anything more to go by , we have to leave this one in the “ undetermined ” column .

unproven	origins : in 1994 , michael moore ’ s tv nation featured a segment about a “ great gatsby ”- like mural in the ballroom of walt disney world ’ s grand floridian resort , painted by an artist who claimed he drew one of the background figures as a nazi . <PARA> two years before the “ tv nation ” segment , the book sabotage in the american workplace , in a section about “ art and design ,” quoted a mural painter ( identified only as “ harvey ”) who recounted his experience working for a company “ that produces custom murals and decorative paintings ”: <PARA> recently we did a job for the walt disney corporation . they specifically requested the great gatsby as the theme , which basically is about rich people in the good old days . the idea was to make the people look happy and create the ideal that people off the streets should strive to get a white suit , panama hat and a croquet mallet . one of my favorite scenes was a hotel scene where people were seated at tables . in the background there was this balcony where i painted this little ss stormtrooper . it was my little comment on what was happening in the rest of the world while the great gatsbys were whittling away their hours with cocktails . my boss noticed it and said that it looked like a soldier , but i convinced him it was a security guard . he dropped it at that . all of the people that i worked with noticed it was a nazi right away . . . it ’ s now installed in a hotel . that gave me a lot of satisfaction . it ’ s pretty minor but it did make me feel better . <PARA> so , does the mural contain a nazi figure ? if the artist is telling the truth , and he intended to draw a nazi in the mural , then the mural indeed contains a nazi figure . it ’ s hard to imagine that anyone not already aware of the artist ’ s gag would notice anything unusual , however — the figure is not depicted as wearing a brown shirt or a swastika armband or any other regalia that identifies it as a nazi . if this mural indeed includes a joke , it ’ s one you only get by knowing the punchline in advance .	
true	in 1989 , the walt disney company discovered that three hallandale , florida , day care centers had 5 - foot - high likenesses of trademarked disney characters such as mickey mouse , minnie mouse , and goofy painted on their walls , disney threatened to go to court if the centers did not remove the drawings , but the threat of legal action did not need to be carried out , as the centers replaced the drawings with cartoon characters belonging to universal studios florida and hanna - barbera productions , who volunteered the use of their character art as part of a publicity ploy . <PARA> disney demanded that the unauthorized 5 - foot - high painted figures of disney characters on the walls of very important babies daycare , good godmother daycare , and temple messianique ( all in hallandale , florida ) be removed for valid business reasons : the unauthorized commercial use of trademarks must be contested in order to keep those trademarks intact , other disney character licensees would have grounds to object if disney provided inexpensive ( or free ) licenses to the centers ( which were , after all , profit - making enterprises ); and the use of disney characters falsely suggested disney ’ s affiliation with the day care facilities . <PARA> disney had also just dealt competing universal studios a severe blow in the theme park business by opening its disney - mgm studios park in orlando , florida , several months ahead of the completion of universal studios ’ own orlando - based studio theme park . universal , still smarting from the early opening of disney ’ s studio - themed park ( universal had been planning such a park in orlando since 1981 but had been struggling with the financing ) and claiming that some of the ideas for disney ’ s park had been stolen from them ( universal alleged that michael eisner had seen the plans for their park when he worked for paramount ), saw in the day care controversy a way to seize some publicity for themselves and give disney a bad name in florida as part of the bargain . <PARA> accordingly , universal studios florida and hanna - barbera productions offered the centers the use of characters from their own cartoons , such as scooby - doo , the flintstones , the jetsons , and yogi bear . universal and hanna - barbera then held a special ceremony showcasing the newly - redecorated day care centers at the temple messanique on 8 august 1989 , attended by costumed characters and executives from both organizations .	
false	examples : <PARA> origins : another brouhaha over entertainers ’ making political <PARA> statements from the stage erupted in mid - july 2004 when singer linda ronstadt closed her performance at the aladdin casino & resort in las vegas by praising filmmaker michael moore as a “ great american patriot ” and “ someone who is spreading the truth ,” encouraging the audience to see his movie fahrenheit 9 / 11 , and dedicating an encore performance of the song “ desperado ” to him . ms . ronstadt ’ s comments drew loud boos from the audience ; some of the 4 , 500 concertgoers present walked out of the theater , while other more unruly patrons tore down concert posters and threw their drinks into the air . <PARA> aladdin president bill timmins described the incident as “ a very ugly scene ,” saying that “[ ronstadt ] praised [ moore ] and all of a sudden all bedlam broke loose .” mr . timmins afterwards claimed that he didn ’ t allow ms . ronstadt back in her luxury suite at the aladdin and had her escorted off the property , maintaining that the singer ’ s remarks “ spoiled a wonderful evening for our guests and we had to do something about it .” he added that “ as long as i ’ m here , she ’ s not going to play .” ( ms . ronstadt had only been booked for a single performance at the aladdin anyway .) <PARA> mr . timmins ’ statements prompted an open letter to him from michael moore , which the filmmaker posted on his web site . however , although mr . moore ’ s letter was real , the putative caustic response to it from mr . timmins quoted above is not — it was a “ here ’ s what i wish he had said ” suggested reply penned by someone else .

true	origins : prior to february 2004 , senator john kerry was the polar opposite of a “ household name ” — very few who didn ’ t follow politics had even heard of him , let alone felt they had some sense of the man . yet his emergence as the democratic party ’ s front runner for the presidential nomination has stirred interest in the senator , leaving a great many folks wondering what sort of fellow he is . <PARA> because few americans will have a chance to make the senator ’ s acquaintance before being called upon to cast their votes in the november <PARA> 2004 election , most will have to base their assessments of his character upon accounts given by others . yet sorting fact from rumor is often a difficult task in that all too often the stories that appear to offer startling insight can ’ t be proved or disproved ; they exist as unverifiable anecdotes ( e . g ., the rumor that john kerry ate some long - suffering pilot ’ s pizza ). <PARA> however , every now and then a story comes along that the news agencies have vetted . which brings us to the “ son of a bitch ” incident of 18 march 2004 . <PARA> while snowboarding in ketchum , idaho , senator kerry was knocked over by one of the secret service men assigned to protect him . according to the new york times , “ mr . kerry [ was ] taken out by one of the secret service men , who had inadvertently moved into his path , sending him into the snow .” a reporter and camera crew , who were following on skis , witnessed the collision but did not capture it on film . <PARA> when asked about the crash , the senator said , “ i don ’ t fall down . that son - of - a - bitch ran into me .” or “ knocked me over ,” depending on which version you heard . <PARA> ( actually , the senator does fall down , at least according to the new york post , which reported him as having taken a header on the wet floor of a convenience store the night before .) <PARA> it probably needs to be pointed out the senator referred to the agent in such fashion to a third party , as opposed to shouting his assessment into the bodyguard ’ s face at the time of the accident . yet , that mr . kerry didn ’ t deliver the insult directly might speak worse of him . though the etiquette mavens might not agree , it ’ s almost understandable to call the other party to an accident all manner of cuss words in the immediate aftermath of a collision . such an outburst is akin to dancing about swearing a blue streak after dropping a hammer on your foot , in that what is vented — though heartily felt at the time — is inappropriate and is realized to be such once the moment has passed . yet , once there is distance between the accident and the fulmination , the “ heat of the moment ” defense no longer applies in that sober reflection is presumed to have taken place in the <PARA> interim . <PARA> did sufficient time pass between the accident and the remark for the initial frustration over having been upended into the snow in front of an audience to have worn off ? or did one follow quickly upon the heels of the other ? <PARA> the new york times characterized that span as “ a moment later ” whereas cnn said “ he later used an expletive to describe the agent who knocked him down ,” a phrasing that implies the passage of a goodly chunk of time , even if it doesn ’ t state so outright . <PARA> whether senator kerry had time to cool down or not , it was churlish of him to call the person charged with protecting his life a son - of - a - bitch , and foolhardy to address such remark to a reporter , an act guaranteed to propel the ire - filled comment into the morning editions . discretion around members of the fourth estate needs to be second nature for those who look to make their careers in politics , in that an elected official given to blurting things willy - nilly is a liability to those he serves . in similar vein , if a man can ’ t be troubled to speak well of his secret service cover , the very agents who will lay down their lives for him , he should at least be enough of a gentleman to refrain from describing them with cuss words . <PARA> some who have encountered this story have stopped to ponder if perhaps the senator voiced his “ son of a bitch ” characterization in an affectionate or playful manner , as some are wont to do in reference to acquaintances they feel particularly close to . or , that the remark had been delivered in a tone of pretend anger as a way of ruefully admitting how inglorious the collision must have appeared to onlookers . yet those theories wash out upon examination of the earliest account . according to the new york times ’ description of the incident , senator kerry wasn ’ t joking — he was pissed off : <PARA> when asked about the mishap a moment later , he said sharply , “ i don ’ t fall down ,” then used an expletive to describe the agent who “ knocked me over .” <PARA> “ sharply ” does not describe any form of affectionate phrasing . <PARA> far from escaping public notice , kerry ’ s characterization of one of his government - appointed bodyguards became fodder for jay leno of the tonight show on 22 march 2004 : <PARA> but he ’ s [ john kerry ] quite an athlete . they showed him snowboarding . he ’ s in idaho and he ’ s snowboarding . you see him on the news ?

true	origins : yes , there was a movie in the works about serial killers paul bernardo and karla homolka , and yes , jason priestly was approached to play the role of paul bernardo . everything expressed in the petition is accurate . yet even so , other than the momentary satisfaction that comes from having expressed one ’ s outrage , there ’ s little reason to “ sign ” it or forward it to others in hopes of garnering their signatures . <PARA> why not , you say ? read on . <PARA> if e - petitions have a valid use , it is in acquainting the online community with deplorable situations that otherwise might not have come to its attention . e - petitions as a way of publicizing causes are useful , but as a method of influencing policy , they are sorely lacking . <PARA> what we ’ ve always said about them still holds true : they are not taken at all seriously by those who receive them . it takes little by way of programming skills to create a routine whereby a list of names and addresses is generated by the computer . someone who wanted to festoon his e - petition with , say , a million “ signatures ” would simply have to run such a program , and there they ’ d be . <PARA> at least with a paper - and - ink petition , the recipient has some small measure of assurance that numerous individuals affixed their john hancocks to the document and thus support the position being advocated . in the case of e - petitions that assurance does not exist ; all the “ signatures ” could have been generated by one person . <PARA> flaws commonly found in petitions ( and noticeably present in this one ) are lack of specificity about who the final document will be presented to or what action is being requested of this individual . petitions that do nothing other than state “ we think this is a crying shame ” don ’ t accomplish anything because they don ’ t request anything be accomplished . they ’ re even less effective when the petition writer has no clear idea who he ’ s going to hand the final document to or what he wants that individual to do about things . “ please sign if you ’ re aggrieved by this too , and once i have enough signatures i ’ ll do something with them , maybe mail them to somebody ” isn ’ t much of a battle plan , as compared to “ this petition requests that [ specific action , ie . withdrawing funding , refusing filming permits ] be taken by [ name of specific influential person ].” <PARA> as a tool to effect change , e - petitions fail with a resounding thud . there are far better ways to register a heartfelt protest , but of course they lack the immediacy and ease of “ signing ” an e - mail and hitting the forward key . how wonderful it is to have a conscience that can be effectively placated by a non - action ! it spares one from actually having to write a real letter or do anything else that would require actual effort . <PARA> situations do arise where outrage needs to be expressed because the emotion is so deeply felt by so many . such a situation was created in december 2000 when filmmaker peter simpson announced plans to make a film based on stephen williams ’ invisible darkness , a work that contains gory details about the rapes of more than a dozen women , culminating in the 1991 - 92 torture and murder of southern ontario teenagers kristin french and leslie mahaffy by paul bernardo ( aka paul teale ) and his wife , karla homolka . <PARA> this announcement was met with widespread outrage by a nation still horrified by the bernardo / homolka crimes . opposition to the project was swift and sure : <PARA> bringing discussion back to the question of the petition , we wonder who the missive would be sent to . officials at every level appear well acquainted with the situation and already heartily predisposed to doing everything in their power to make sure the film is not made . if the purpose of a petition is to acquaint an important personage with one ’ s cause and influence him into supporting it , hasn ’ t that already been accomplished ? <PARA> one good thing may come of the furor over the proposed bernardo film ; it has kicked into motion at the ontario provincial government level a proposed act that would render criminals such as sex killer paul bernardo forever unable to profit from recounting their deeds . if passed , the prohibiting profiting from recounting crimes act would allow the government to seize profits earned by a criminal through books , interviews , or other media . it is the first act of its kind in canada . <PARA> barbara “ act of the apostles ” mikkelson <PARA> update : a film about paul bernardo and karla homolka , entitled karla and starring misha collins and laura prepon in the lead roles , was completed in 2005 .	
true	origins : on 8 may 2006 , an 18 - year - old man opened fire in the parking lot of the sully district police station in chantilly , va . three officers were shot in the impromptu ambush , one ( vicky armel ) dying at the scene , another ( michael garbarino ) expiring in hospital a little over a week later , and a third suffering minor injuries . the assailant , michael kennedy , was gunned down during the <PARA> shootout . <PARA> during the disturbed young man ’ s rampage , streets near the police station were cordoned off , an act that closed some businesses for part of that day . the subsequent funeral processions for the two fallen officers further interfered with commerce local to the sully district station as large crowds came to line the route . <PARA> an outlet of the texas roadhouse restaurant chain so affected pegged its shooting - related losses at $ 9 , 000 — $ 5 , 000 for the day of the parking lot ambush , and $ 2 , 000 for each of the two funeral processions that went past the station . its manager , eric rainwater , sought to use the $ 9 , 000 estimated loss to offset a $ 5 , 000 fine the restaurant had incurred for its malfunctioning alarm system which had repeatedly summoned police under false pretenses . rainwater sent a letter to the police department ’ s false alarm reduction unit asking that the $ 5 , 000 fine be waived . “ although this is miniscule in comparison to two officers losing their lives , it did have a major financial impact on our store ,” wrote rainwater . <PARA> the reaction to rainwater ’ s request was not positive . captain susan culin , commander of the sully station , directed a memo to her officers “ just to make you aware of the situation ,” characterizing the texas roadhouse manager ’ s proposal as being “ in extremely poor taste ,” and letting them know that “ while we all have to make our own choices , i personally will never give the restaurant my business , or my family ’ s business , again .” <PARA> culin also contacted texas roadhouse ’ s corporate office to acquaint them with her view of the request and to juxtapose it with the fundraisers for the deceased officers ’ families that other area businesses had conducted . yet it was more than three weeks before she heard back from them . <PARA> texas roadhouse eventually sent apologies for the request and made a donation to a trust fund for the families of the fairfax county officers . capt . culin has stated the fairfax county police department is satisfied with the response it received from texas roadhouse and circulated a memo to that effect to her officers . <PARA> however , that apologies were eventually proffered and accepted and a donation made to the fund for the families of the deceased officers doesn ’ t change that the situation was mishandled by the restaurant chain , or that the community beyond the immediate participants in the contretemps will continue to be troubled by what happened even as texas roadhouse and the fairfax county police department want to consider the matter ended . <PARA> as was the case with the uproar over a starbucks barista who charged ambulance workers $ 130 for water they needed to treat victims of the 9 / 11 attacks at the world trade center , the error of one employee was compounded by the seemingly uncaring corporation behind him through its non - response to his act . capt . culin ’ s attempts to bring the matter of rainwater ’ s mid - june 2006 letter to the attention of the restaurant chain ’ s management were pushed aside for three weeks , and it was a couple of months before things were resolved — because , according to texas roadhouse ’ s corporate spokesman travis doster , “ we ’ re a very decentralized company ” and there was “ miscommunication ” between the main office and the restaurant ’ s virginia operation . whereas a swift “ we ’ re sorry — the manager of our chantilly restaurant shouldn ’ t have sent you such a letter — what can we do to make this right ?” would likely have worked wonders in terms of undoing the damage , instead the captain was given the runaround and her calls weren ’ t returned . <PARA> the measure of a business is often found not in what it does right , but in how well and how quickly it handles matters when things have gone wrong . <PARA> the much - circulated article quoted above is the work of jonathan bernstein , ceo of bernstein crisis management , a public relations firm specializing in corporate damage control . his “ texas roadhouse makes police sick ” piece was offered in his monthly online newsletter as a study in how not to handle incidents that have the potential to give businesses bad names . as an example of the sort of ill feeling corporate entities can be left to live with through their failure to speedily address matters when things go awry , bernstein within his article quoted the following letter , which he says was sent by a police officer to texas roadhouse through the contact page on the restaurant ’ s web site : <PARA> it has come to my attention that i owe your establishment an apology . i am an officer with fairfax county . earlier this year , i had the unfortunate experience of listening as two of my co - workers died of gunshot wounds near your restaurant . the ensuing investigation , regrettably , blocked ( from your <PARA> account ) thousands of dollars worth of hungry citizens from eating that night . i compounded this problem by participating in a funeral procession , not once but twice , for my co - workers and again blocked thousands of dollars worth of business from you . i humbly apologize for such egregious actions on my part and will endeavor to , in the future and to what extent i can , not allow petty police actions from interrupting your business . i have asked all my co - workers to heed this and next time pick a more commercially advantageous spot to be ambushed and killed . if anything , i have requested that they all die at once , such that multiple funeral processions will not be necessary . in an effort to make sure that i am effective in my efforts , i have barred myself , and all those i can influence from entering or even parking in your establishment . this way i can be sure that my presence will not have the same selfish and undesired affect . if there is anything else that i can do to make sure your establishment has a banner year , please feel free to contact me . i will forward this message to all concerned parties . <PARA> barbara “ sully ’ d reputation ” mikkelson

true	club 33 , open only to members and their guests , has been a part of new orleans square since 1967 . <PARA> originally intended as a private facility where walt disney could entertain park sponsors and lessees , club 33 did not open until several months after disney ’ s death . the club ’ s facilities were made available to the public through limited memberships , and club 33 operated unobtrusively in disneyland ’ s new orleans square — until the advent of social media made information about what was once a somewhat - secret facility easy to find . club 33 is also the only place inside the park itself where alcohol is available , although properties such as california adventure and downtown disney serve alcoholic beverages . <PARA> in july 2010 , the disney parks blog mentioned the establishment in two disney history items . the site published a lengthy club 33 profile in august 2011 , providing a “ brief history ” of the venue : <PARA> in 2012 , the blog announced that club 33 ’ s waiting list was open to a “ limited number ” of new applicants : <PARA> la weekly described club 33 as quite possibly “ disneyland ’ s worst kept secret ” in 2013 , reporting that non - members could access the venue in one of two ways ( and confirming prices were steep to those with connections ): <PARA> in 2016 , an extensive profile of club 33 was published by insider . several details and images for the piece were gleaned from an instagram account ( <USER> operated by a club 33 member and devoted to documenting its offerings . and in april 2017 , a disney spokesperson confirmed to the orlando sentinel that four additional club 33 locations were set to open ( in addition to versions at tokyo disneyland and shanghai disneyland ). <PARA> on 19 december 2017 , outlets reported a lawsuit filed against club 33 ( following a similar suit brought in 2015 ) which provided “ a rare peek at the strict rules and code of conduct for members of the exclusive club , which has operated in disneyland ’ s new orleans square since 1967 ”: <PARA> although club 33 is no longer the enigma it once was , widespread documentation of the venue didn ’ t eliminate its allure entirely . the “ secret spot ” remained a hot topic on disney - centric blogs and forums , and entry to the expanding number of properties still required hefty fees and connections to those wishing to experience it firsthand .

false	origins : the map displayed above is a clever bit of political humor , but if god is trying to send united states citizens a message about their presidential choices , he isn ’ t doing it by unleashing hurricanes on florida . <PARA> in the space of one month in august - september 2004 , the state of florida ( where contested election results produced a prolonged controversy whose resolution was instrumental in deciding the 2000 presidential election ) was pummeled by three different hurricanes : <PARA> the map shown above presents the hurricanes as if they traversed neat , narrow paths , hitting only counties that voted for george bush in 2000 ( colored pink ) and avoiding all counties that voted for al gore ( colored blue ). it took some finagling with the actual storm data to produce those results , however . <PARA> the path of hurricane charley is depicted quite differently in the graphic above than was reported by news sources — charley ( see chart below ) exited florida right through the heart of volusia county ( which voted for gore in 2000 ); the hurricane didn ’ t neatly head due north and thereby skip right on past volusia as shown above . also , hurricane ivan primarily hit alabama , not florida , just grazing the latter ’ s panhandle region : <PARA> the western edge of the florida panhandle is an area that generally votes republican , so the counties primarily affected by it ( escambia , santa rosa , okaloosa and bay counties ) were indeed all ones that had gone for bush in 2000 . but the map at the head of this page also shows hurricane charley as passing right on by the democratic counties of osceola , orange , and volusia , even though many sources , including the florida state emergency operations center , indicated that it hit all of them ( note that the city of orlando is in orange county , and daytona beach is in volusia ): <PARA> charley continued its track northeast across desoto , hardee , polk , and osceola counties . at approximately 9 : 15 pm edt , the eye of the storm was centered at kissimmee , over northern osceola county . charley then moved over the orlando area between 8 : 45 pm and 9 : 30 pm edt . orlando international airport reported a gust to near 105 mph at 9 : 15 pm edt , with sustained winds anywhere from 60 - 70 mph . by 10 : 09 pm edt , the sanford airport just northeast of orlando was gusting to 92 mph . the circulation center of hurricane charley passed over the coast near daytona beach at approximately 11 : 30 pm edt . at 11 : 25 pm edt , the daytona beach airport observed 69 mph sustained winds , with an 83 mph gust . charley emerged off the volusia county coast and back into the atlantic just northeast of daytona around 1 : 00 am edt on saturday , 14 august . by 2 : 00 am edt , the center was over the atlantic about 45 miles north - northeast of daytona beach , with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph and a minimum central pressure of 993 millibars . <PARA> likewise , local news reports detailed the damage done to the democratic county of st . lucie by hurricane frances : <PARA> about $ 740 million in damage from hurricane frances has been reported to privately owned buildings in unincorporated st . lucie county , most of it to residences , including mobile homes , according to a report released monday . <PARA> about $ 123 million of the damage was to mobile homes and $ 504 million was to other residential properties . the rest , $ 113 million , was to commercial property . <PARA> damage to county , municipal and school district property was put at more than $ 120 . 6 million . county department heads prepared the report for county commissioners . <PARA> about $ 123 million of the damage was to mobile homes and $ 504 million was to other residential properties . the rest , $ 113 million , was to commercial property . <PARA> damage to county , municipal and school district property was put at more than $ 120 . 6 million . county department heads prepared the report for county commissioners . <PARA> democratic pasco county wasn ’ t spared by frances either : <PARA> after lashing pasco county for most of the day sunday , tropical storm frances damaged mobile homes , toppled trees and left roughly 52 , 000 people without power . <PARA> the winds grew so severe around noon that officials pulled fire and rescue crews from the roads , fearing the high gusts could tip over the large ambulances or firetrucks . until sunday evening , crews responded only to life - threatening emergencies after evaluating conditions on a case - by - case basis . <PARA> the winds grew so severe around noon that officials pulled fire and rescue crews from the roads , fearing the high gusts could tip over the large ambulances or firetrucks . until sunday evening , crews responded only to life - threatening emergencies after evaluating conditions on a case - by - case basis . <PARA> observations regarding which states the hurricanes might have hit before or after touching florida are similarly silly . take a look at a map showing the results of the 2000 presidential election ( states won by george bush are shown in blue ): <PARA> george bush won all the states on the atlantic coast north of florida up to the virginias , all the states west of florida clear over to texas , as well as every other state in the south . unless a hurricane miraculously skipped several hundred miles overland all the way from florida to new mexico or illinois , without touching any intervening states , any other state it hit was bound to be one that voted republican in 2000 .

false	origins : clara bow . the “ it ” girl . most people are familiar with those names , even if they don ’ t know who clara bow was or how she came by the nickname . <PARA> simply put , bow was the hottest actress of the late 1920s ( until silent films were supplanted by “ talkies ”), the girl with the “ heart - shaped face , an hour - glass figure , and thick auburn hair dyed a flaming orange - red .” the film that made her a household name was 1927 ’ s it , based on a turgid novelette by the dowager elinor glyn ( renowned for her 1907 novel three weeks , which featured a scandalous tryst on a tiger - skin rug ). although even glyn couldn ’ t provide a consistent definition of just what “ it ” was , everyone knew what “ it ” meant . ( or , as dorothy parker quipped about it ‘ s heroine : “ it , hell : she had those .”) <PARA> off - screen , clara bow lived up to her on - screen reputation , engaging in affairs ( under the guise of on - again , off - again “ engagements ”) with actors gilbert roland and gary cooper , director victor fleming , a married doctor named earl pearson , and “ king of broadway ” harry richman . gossip about bow ’ s private life was so pervasive that in 1931 the coast reporter ran a three - week series in which it named her as the mistress of several different men and claimed that she often had sex in public , engaged in threesomes with prostitutes , slept with women when no man was available , and turned to animals when no human companionship was at hand . these outrageous tales were widely believed by a public that assumed a publication wouldn ’ t dare to print such stories unless they were true . small wonder , then , that decades later , the public would similarly believe the scandalous tales about clara ’ s taking on the entire usc football team printed in kenneth anger ’ s notorious book hollywood babylon . belief , however , does not turn rumor into <PARA> fact . <PARA> as we investigate the genesis of the rumor , keep in mind that los angeles of the 1920s offered little in the way of entertainment outside of movies . it was not yet a cosmopolitan town whose artistic attractions could rival new york , chicago , or san francisco , nor would it have a major league professional sports team until the nfl ’ s cleveland rams moved to los angeles in 1946 . college football was the biggest game in town back then , and the usc trojans ’ “ thundering herd ” was a wildly popular crowd favorite . clara bow attended at her first usc game in 1926 as part of a promotion for her new film it and wangled tickets to a 1927 game from a paramount publicity man who had formerly worked for usc . clara was fascinated with the trojan players , particularly captain and all - american quarterback morley drury . clara later arranged a double date for herself and best friend tui lorraine with drury and his fraternity brother tom dorsey . as drury told bow ’ s biographer david stenn , however , “ nothing happened . we never got involved in a ‘ bedroom scene ’ or anything like that . we were too damn innocent .” <PARA> nonetheless , clara began entertaining the usc trojans and their opponents at her house after every home game . food and music and dancing were part of the program , but sex ( or even alcohol ) was not . as usc end lowry mccaslin admitted , “ we had a good time , but it wasn ’ t that exciting .” and as biographer stenn noted , “ the quaint reality of these evenings hardly corresponds with the scurrilous rumors spread about them later .” <PARA> bow ’ s domineering father objected to her saturday evening revelries , however , so she took to entertaining <PARA> groups of players in her room at the infamous mansion - turned - hotel known as the garden of allah on sunset blvd . but even then , the main events were dancing and early morning swims in the hotel pool . clara ’ s father soon put a stop to these festivities as well , and her contact with the usc football team was reduced to hosting an annual dinner for them at her home . the wild rumors about crazed orgies where clara bow provided personal “ entertainment ” for the entire “ beer - swilling , gang - banging ” trojan squad grew over the ensuing decades , even though , as stenn wrote , “ the facts reveal a group of well - behaved boys who were , in morley drury ’ s own words , ‘ too damn innocent ’ to be anything else .” <PARA> incidentally , usc footballer marion morrison — later to become world - famous as an actor named john wayne — suffered a shoulder injury in 1927 and didn ’ t play at all that year .

true	a common form of “ instant wealth ” legend involves a person who receives a large , unexpected inheritance from a wealthy benefactor — someone with whom the recipient has had only brief , incidental contact , but during that fleeting moment performed a kindness later rewarded in spades . examples of this motif include the tale of a man who engages in a one - night stand with the widowed owner of a country inn and several months later finds out she has left him both the inn and a tidy sum of money in her will , and the legend of the traveler who casually stumbles upon a stranger ’ s funeral and afterwards learns that the deceased was a wealthy man who decreed that his fortune should be divided among all those who attended his final services . <PARA> that stories of this ilk are familiar urban legends doesn ’ t mean they don ’ t occasionally play out in real life , however . one such case occurred in 1951 , when margaret jorgenson , a divorced dressmaker from oshkosh , wisconsin , died at the age of 66 and left behind a will bequeathing her entire estate , valued at the then - considerable sum of $ 97 , 864 ( over $ 1 million in 2019 dollars ) to one joseph kogut . <PARA> who was joseph kogut ? he was an unmarried , 41 - year - old new york central railroad inspector from cuyler , new york , whom miss jorgenson had randomly encountered in a chicago hotel elevator one day in november 1950 when kogut was in the windy city on business . the two struck up a conversation over the headline of a newspaper miss jorgenson was carrying that day ( about the victory of everett dirksen in the previous day ’ s election for one of illinois ’ u . s . senate seats ), had lunch together , and then went their separate ways after spending a total of about four hours together . apart from that one encounter , they never saw or spoke to each other again ( although they did carry on a correspondence by mail ). <PARA> before miss jorgenson died several months later , she made out a will naming mr . kogut as her sole beneficiary . her disgruntled relatives ( two brothers and a sister , whom jorgenson had left out of her will because she felt they had neglected her ) contested the will , claiming that mr . kogut had “ exercised undue influence ” on miss jorgenson . three years later the siblings finally agreed to a settlement that paid each of them $ 16 , 000 and awarded the remainder of margaret jorgenson ’ s estate ( estimated at $ 40 , 000 after taxes , or about $ 400 , 000 in 2019 dollars ) to joseph kogut .

false	origins : the spate of bombings and attempted bombings in the london underground in july 2005 have left many commuters and those who care about them feeling anxious and at risk . one way we as humans struggle to overcome <PARA> the discomfiting sensations of helplessness and disquiet is to search for something , anything , that restores so much as the smallest part of our usual sense of control over events . we are used to believing we are in charge of our own lives , so we cast about desparately for that which will return things to what we see as their proper state of our directing , or at least influencing , our outcomes . <PARA> the seemingly helpful heads up about connecting to emergency services via using an alternate phone number when deep in the subway system is part of that search , in that it gives the appearance of being information those traveling in risky circumstances could put to use . however , it ’ s all a chimera : while the need to feel safe once again ( or at least capable of being quickly rescued ) is real , the intelligence about an alternate phone number that will always work is not . <PARA> the global mobile emergency number , 112 , is “ special ” in the sense that ( unlike other local emergency numbers , such as 999 ) it will use any tower your mobile phone can contact to complete the call , regardless of whether or not your phone is authorized to relay signals through that tower . however , the 112 number has no special properties that enable callers to use it in areas where all cellular signals are blocked ( or otherwise unavailable ). mobile phones do not work in many parts of the london underground , and satellite signals cannot reach there either . while dialing 112 or 999 will put you through to emergency services in britain when your mobile has signal , such calls will not go through when your unit does not . many sections of the london underground are far too deep for satellite signal to penetrate ; in those areas , calls to neither 112 nor 999 will connect . <PARA> more succinctly , when there ’ s not enough signal with which to make a call to 999 , there will not be enough to make one to 112 . <PARA> london transport and mobile firms are warning people about the e - mail quoted above , saying it contains inaccurate safety information . <PARA> “ this e - mail is incorrect . the 112 number does link people through to 999 , but it only works if you have a signal on your mobile phone . if you have no signal bars on your phone , it will not work ,” a spokesperson from london transport said . <PARA> “ it will not divert to a satellite signal .” <PARA> “ even with a satellite mobile phone ( which very few people have ), you would need to have a clear line - of - sight to the satellite . you would have to be outside , not in a building or a tube tunnel .” <PARA> “ it will not divert to a satellite signal .” <PARA> “ even with a satellite mobile phone ( which very few people have ), you would need to have a clear line - of - sight to the satellite . you would have to be outside , not in a building or a tube tunnel .” <PARA> the “ helpful ” advisory about dialing 112 is not the first bit of e - mailed misinformation to arise from the london bombings . a useful suggestion that the cell - enabled store an “ in case of emergency ” ( i . c . e .) contact number in their units attracted a hoax that warned against doing so lest such entry leave users ’ phones open to theft of their prepaid minutes . we cover both the emergency contact brainchild and the hoax that followed it on our page about the push to get cell users to store i . c . e . numbers in their phones . <PARA> barbara “ i . c . e . capades ” mikkelson

false	origins : in late december 2003 , several news agencies picked up a story about indonesian villagers who had reportedly captured a python “ officially ” measured at nearly 49 feet ( 14 . 85 meters ) long , tipping the scales at a whopping 983 pounds ( 447 kilograms ), with a diameter of 2 . 8 feet ( 85 cm ). <PARA> the original source for the story , the indonesian newspaper republika , included the detail that the slithery reptile ate “ three or four dogs a month .” the snake was said to have been caught and kept by members of the kubu tribe on the island of sumatra who “ revered the creature as a ruler ,” requiring animal handlers to wait several months before obtaining the villagers ’ permission to bring it to an animal exhibition at curugsewu park on the island of java . <PARA> if the claims were true , this would have been one extraordinary snake : the guinness book of world records lists the longest snake ever found at 32 . 75 feet ( 10 meters ) — for a specimen shot in celebes , indonesia , in 1912 — and heaviest ( living ) snake at 403 lb . ( 182 . 76 kg ) — a burmese python on display at the serpent safari park in gurnee , illinois ). the recent indonesian find would have exceeded the largest known snake in length by nearly 50 % and in weight by an amazing 140 %. <PARA> but , as the british newspaper the guardian discovered when it sent a reporter out to actually measure the legendary snake , claims about the reptile ’ s size were rather exaggerated — their man measured fragrant flower , as the reticulated python is now known , at between 21 and 23 feet ( 6 . 5 to 7 meters ) in length , and estimated its weight at about 220 pounds ( 100 kg ). <PARA> snake handler imam darmanto offered several reasons for the discrepancies in measurements : <PARA> look , you must understand that a python ’ s length is not constant . depending on the weather , on how recently he has eaten and when he last shed his skin , fragrant can stretch and contract a great deal . a few days ago he stretched himself out halfway round the cage . the reason he is not that large now is because he has not eaten for about six weeks and has just shed his skin so his body is quite firm at the moment . when he ’ s at his full length he ’ s much softer and i can push my finger in much further . and his body is much fatter too , perhaps up to 50cm in diameter . <PARA> nonetheless , guardian reporter john aglionby ’ s measurements , although admittedly imprecise , had fragrant flower nowhere near its claimed length , width , or girth : <PARA> indeed , “ coming up well short ” does not do justice to the disparity between the claimed length and the length i measured . if fragrant ever extends to 14 . 85m long he will be the most mind - boggling animal on earth because i measured him at somewhere between 6 . 5 and 7m . <PARA> the imprecise estimate is due to my reluctance to grab hold of his tail and stretch out the beautiful body that is a patchwork of brown , dark yellow and black scales even though fragrant seems docile enough . . . <PARA> weighing the python is impossible . judging by a tentative feel of his body while his attention is distracted by children poking their fingers through his cage , i would put it at perhaps 100kg but no more . . . i poke the body : it seems pretty squidgey and closer to 20 cm across . <PARA> the imprecise estimate is due to my reluctance to grab hold of his tail and stretch out the beautiful body that is a patchwork of brown , dark yellow and black scales even though fragrant seems docile enough . . . <PARA> weighing the python is impossible . judging by a tentative feel of his body while his attention is distracted by children poking their fingers through his cage , i would put it at perhaps 100kg but no more . . . i poke the body : it seems pretty squidgey and closer to 20 cm across . <PARA> a reuters photographer dispatched to the curugsewu park to measure the talk - of - the - town snake obtained similar results : <PARA> amid growing skepticism of the claim , a photographer working for reuters returned to the curugsewu park in the small central java town of kendal with a measuring tape . the snake ’ s true length — around 21 feet . <PARA> “ i have no idea why the snake has shrunk ,” said one keeper when asked about the discrepancy , as the snake lounged on a tree branch inside its cage . <PARA> “ i have no idea why the snake has shrunk ,” said one keeper when asked about the discrepancy , as the snake lounged on a tree branch inside its cage . <PARA> the guardian also quoted richard shine , a python expert from sydney university , as noting that during his extensive research he had found pythons containing recently - eaten “ monkeys , pigs and even porcupines but no dogs ,” and that “ these giant pythons always shrink whenever a tape measure turns up .” <PARA> fragrant flower is a monster of a snake , but it ’ s far short of being the record - setting giant initial reports made it out to be . <PARA> giant python on display ( msnbc ) <PARA> stay still , will you ?

false	origins : proving once again the maxim that there ’ s nothing new under the sun ( or “ everything old is new again ”) comes the set of photographs displayed above , purportedly depicting a bizarre ocean - dwelling “ mermaid ” creature unearthed by powerful tidal forces , the latest entry in a series of older photographs being passed off as images associated with the december 2004 indian ocean tsunami . <PARA> we last saw these very same photographs back in 2003 , when they were circulated on the internet as a “ mermaid found in the philippines ” who had been “ caught by fishermen in visayas region .” not only were they hoaxes — then and now — but hoaxes of a type that is hundreds if not thousands of years old . <PARA> creatures identified as “ merfolk ” ( half - human , half - fish creatures who live in the sea , both male “ mermen ” and female “ mermaids ”) have been a staple of folklore and mythology for many centuries . although the popular modern image of merfolk is almost exclusively limited to depictions of human - sized , attractive females with human upper torsos and fish - like tails ( as exemplified by ariel , the heroine of disney ’ s popular 1989 animated film adaptation of “ the little mermaid ,” an 1836 children ’ s story by <PARA> hans christian andersen ), that image has not always been the standard . <PARA> depictions of mermaids as gruesome , dimunitive creatures , and the use of parts of other animals ( primarily monkeys and fish ) to create exemplars of such creatures , are both very , very old , as demonstrated by a supposed mummified mermaid which was exhibited in japan several centuries ago and is thought to be up to 1 , 400 years old . <PARA> more recently ( but still a considerable time ago ) phony mermaid - like creatures crafted from various body parts and bones of fish and other animals , usually joined to dessicated monkey heads or skulls , were a common feature of 19th - century dime museums , carnivals , traveling circuses and their sideshows . although many such fabricated mermaids date from that era , the most famous example was the “ feejee mermaid ” ( also known as the “ fiji mermaid ” or “ fejee “ mermaid ”), a grotesque creature allegedly “ taken [ by japanese fishermen ] among the fejee islands , and preserved in china ” before being purchased by one dr . j . griffin , acting an agent of the lyceum of natural history in london , in 1842 : <PARA> the mysterious dr . griffin was in fact a fictitious character played by levi lyman , an associate of the famous american showman and huckster p . t . barnum , who exhibited the “ found ” creature throughout the u . s . and in his new york - based american museum for a couple of decades before it was lost when the museum was destroyed by a fire in 1865 . the “ mermaid ” was actually pieced together using papier - mâché , fish parts , the body of an infant orangutan , and a monkey head . <PARA> although times have changed considerably since the days of barnum , human nature has not . we continue to be fascinated by the same tales and the same forgeries , crafted in the same time - honored fashion .	
false	the introductions of new , widely - adopted technologies are often accompanied by fears of possible deleterious effects from the use of such devices , everything from concerns that telephones would spell the end of regional accents to parental admonitions not to sit too close to the television ( lest you ruin your eyes !). usually these fears are largely allayed after a few years , as the technologies improve and become ubiquitous , and evidence of the feared negative effects fails to materialize . nonetheless , even though the microwave oven has been a standard household appliance for several decades now , rumors continue to linger that microwaves somehow “ change the molecular structure ” of consumables and therefore make food products heated in them unsafe to eat . the sample “ experiment ” represented below is an expression of that sort of rumor , but it is pure junk science , both in its methodology and its conclusions : <PARA> first of all , there ’ s some doubt as to whether the photographs displayed above actually depict a real experiment rather than some digital fakery , as the “ day one ” and “ day five ” photos appear to be remarkably consistent in camera angle , lighting , positioning , background elements , and everything else save for the appearance of the “ dying ” plant : <PARA> regardless , water heated in a microwave oven is no different in “ structure or energy ” than water heated with a gas flame , on an electric stove , or over a wood fire : it ’ s just water , plain and simple . more important , though , is the awareness that drawing valid scientific conclusions from experimentation involves conducting multiple trials under carefully controlled conditions , something not in evidence here . the extraneous factors that could have produced the exhibited results ( i . e ., one live plant and one dead plant ) exhibited above are legion . for example : <PARA> rather than simply speculate , though , we performed the same experiment in a more controlled manner . we started out with three each of three different types of plants : one member of each set was given water that had been boiled on a gas stove , water that had been boiled in a microwave oven , or water that had not been boiled at all . all the water used in the experiment came from the same source , the same vessel was used for boiling water both on the stove and in the microwave , and all three types of water were stored in identical containers . the water given to all of the plants was at room temperature . the plants were kept in a carefully controlled environment that protected them from our pets and equalized ( as much as possible ) their exposure to environmental factors and watered in the manner described above for a period of time identical to that of the original experiment . <PARA> as evidenced by the photos below ( taken while the plants were briefly removed from the environment in which they were tended and placed in a setting better suited to photography ), at the end of that time period all three plants in each set were fairly thriving . when a non - participating observer was asked to indicate ( blindly ) which plant in each set he thought had fared the best , in two cases he selected plants that had been given microwave - boiled water , and in one case he selected a plant that had been given unboiled water : <PARA> as for the coda to the example quoted at the head of this page , there have been some cases in which the use of microwave - heated blood in medical procedures has been cited as causing serious problems , but not because microwave heating “ corrupts the dna .” rather , conventional microwave ovens can heat blood too quickly and / or too unevenly ( resulting in hemolysis ), so standard ( and slower ) blood warming procedures are generally preferred or mandated .	
false	on 25 may 2006 , the u . s . senate , by a 62 - 36 bipartisan vote , passed the comprehensive immigration reform act of 2006 ( cira ) — a controversial bill which proponents touted as providing comprehensive and humane immigration reform , and which opponents criticized as unfairly rewarding “ illegal aliens ” by allowing them to obtain legal status . <PARA> on 18 may 2006 , while the comprehensive immigration reform act was still under consideration , senator john ensign of nevada proposed an amendment to the bill to “ ensure that persons who receive an adjustment of status under [ the comprehensive immigration reform act ] are not able to receive social security benefits as a result of unlawful activity .” the crux of senator ensign ’ s argument was that immigrants who had entered and worked in the u . s . “ illegally ” and paid into the social security system using fraudulently - obtained social security numbers should not be allowed to receive credit for those payments : <PARA> the senate vote on this amendment is what is reproduced in this email : <PARA> although the message ’ s text accurately reflects the roll call vote that took place , the accuracy of its characterization of those senators who voted “ yea ” as voting “ to give ‘ illegal aliens ’ social security benefits ” is not accurate for a number of reasons : <PARA> in a nutshell , the amendment referenced above wasn ’ t about “ giving ‘ illegal aliens ’ social security benefits ”; it was about whether formerly “ illegal aliens ” ( who had since become legal ) should be credited for monies they themselves had paid into the social security fund while they were in the u . s . “ illegally .” the senators listed above did not vote in favor of this proposition ; they voted to withdraw the amendment from consideration .	
true	origins : many readers spotted this item about avian coin thieves on the utah birds web site . the utah birds folks were e - mailed the story and found it interesting enough to put it up on their site , but they initially didn ’ t know anything more about it . all the information that could be gleaned from this message — that a car wash in frederick , maryland , installed by someone named bill had supposedly been losing thousands of quarters to coin - stealing birds — wasn ’ t much to go on . <PARA> a newsperson from 98 rock fm radio in baltimore was kind enough to supply us with the missing details . the car wash pictured above is actually in fredericksburg , virginia , not frederick , maryland . bill dougherty at magic wand inc ., the car wash outfit that installs and maintains these machines , confirmed that birds had indeed been making off with hundreds of quarters per day . <PARA> as described above , after mr . dougherty discovered the fredericksburg car wash machine was coming up several hundred dollars short per week , he initially suspected his employees of using pass keys to loot the machine . when he set undertook a surveillance mission with a camera in hand to catch the thieves in action he did indeed manage to snap pictures of the perpetrators in the act , but they weren ’ t quite what he expected . not only were the “ thieves ” who were stealing the quarters of the avian variety ; they were working in tandem to do so : one bird would go up inside the machine to jimmy coins loose , and the other birds would grab them and fly off with them . <PARA> starlings , the birds pictured here , are often attracted to bright , shiny objects and will collect them for nesting or mate - attraction purposes whenever the opportunity presents itself . most likely one or more starlings was attracted by the glint of overlooked quarters in the change cup and made off with them ; other starlings saw where the quarters were coming from and imitated the behavior , learning in the process how to work as teams to retrieve coins from inside the machine itself . <PARA> the claim that an accumulated $ 4 , 000 in change was retrieved from the roof of the car wash is an embellishment . the car wash operator did not report finding any such rooftop stash , although his discovering a few hundred quarters on the ground around the machine some mornings was not uncommon .	
true	this is an advertisement from the yellow pages , until they realised that if you turned it upside down and covered the lady ’ s head and the hand holding the glass , all was not as it seemed . <PARA> the telephone company has now taken this ad out because of the content . <PARA> take a look at the first picture , and then the second picture ( which is an inverted version of the first ), watch as her face and the glass are covered — and see what you get . <PARA> p . s . where do people find the time to read the yellow pages upside down ?? <PARA> some critics have long maintained that companies and their advertising agencies often employ subliminal advertising to increase sales by concealing words and images ( usually of a sexually suggestive nature ) in their advertisements . the nature of “ subliminal ,” of course , means that these alleged hidden persuaders are not obvious to the ordinary viewer and may require intense scrutiny or an unusual approach ( such as viewing an image backwards , upside - down , or with a magnifying glass ) to discern . <PARA> such is the nature of the putative advertisement from the yellow pages ( a pre - internet printed phone directory of business services ) for a flooring company displayed above , which is accompanied by an illustration of a woman holding a champagne glass that , when flipped upside - down and cropped in half horizontally , resembles an image of a woman with no lower undergarments touching herself in a strategically sensitive area . <PARA> several clues might suggest that this image was something put together as a joke rather than a genuine yellow pages ad : <PARA> however , there is indeed a business by the name of d . j . flooring in brighton , east sussex , with one of the phone numbers shown . a call to them elicited the response that the ad was indeed genuine and had been run in the mid - 1990s , and the illustration was also used on the company ’ s vans until people started making a fuss about it . the business had to change their phone number due to the notoriety created by the ad ; the previous number is now the company ’ s fax line . d . j . flooring ’ s later yellow pages ad was rather sedate by comparison : <PARA> these types of images have a history of being circulated as copylore / faxlore as well , as demonstrated by a similar example from the ultimate book of rude and politically incorrect jokes : <PARA> the same image incorporated into the yellow pages ad displayed at the head of this page has also been used in other contexts , as exemplified by a reader - supplied scan of a matchbook obtained in a geneva , switzerland , bar circa 1990 : <PARA> another reader passed along an example of a genuine yellow pages ad ( from kitchener , ontario , canada ) for a bar that made use of this illustration :

false	a warning about seemingly lost children being used as victim lure by rapists appeared on the internet in late march 2005 . versions in circulation via cell phone text message and e - mail in november 2010 repositioned the alert from one about lone attackers luring women to houses whose doorbells had been wired to deliver a knockout shock to even more vague cautions about “ a way for gang members to rape women ” in one instance and “ a new way to gang rape girls ” in another : <PARA> all the incarnations we ’ ve encountered of this warning have been marvels of nonspecificity : none of them indicated when or where any such attack supposedly took place , or even stated who was issuing the warning : <PARA> we scoured recent news stories in the u . s . looking for articles about such an assault and were unable to find any . if such a method of luring rape victims to their attackers had been used in one instance ( and we ’ ve little reason to believe that it has ), there has certainly not been a rash of small children pretending to be lost as part of a scheme to place women in jeopardy . <PARA> lacking any news accounts of a crime that would fit what has been described , we ’ re going to drop this one into the ‘ false ’ column both because the story echoes too closely other baseless scare stories about lurking dangers to women , and because the methodology described is so far removed from that employed by the majority of rapists . <PARA> almost all rapes are crimes of opportunity ; that is , either the attacker sees a potential victim and sets about to subdue her , or he encounters an unlocked or easily - breached house that he knows contains a target . the vast majority of rapists do not look to have their prey delivered to them because the stalking , choosing , and overpowering of their marks are key to what they seek . ( assault of this nature is far more about dominance , rage , or punishment than it is about sexual satisfaction .) <PARA> under the “ lured by a child ” method outlined in the warning , rapists would be surrendering one of the most basic components of their thrill : victim selection . instead , they would be resigning themselves to having no say about whom they would be assaulting , their judas goats ( the children they were using ) making that choice for <PARA> them . <PARA> although every rapist is different , in terms of motivation they mostly fall into three broad categories : anger , power , and sadism . we discuss a great deal more about these motivations in our assaulted tale article , but suffice it to say having unconscious women they themselves hadn ’ t selected served up on their doorstep wouldn ’ t fit the profile of the overwhelming majority of these criminals . <PARA> the tip - off about rapists using small children to ensnare women in their traps very closely fits an urban legend set in world war ii that we know to have been around since at least 1985 , the venerable letter of intent , wherein young women are impelled through their sense of compassion to hand - deliver a letter on behalf of a blind man and by so doing deliver themselves up for butchery . in a more general sense , like the almost - victims in the shopping mauled legend ( woman who stops to pick up an “ old lady ” stranded on a dark country road or who is asked by one in a mall parking lot for a ride barely escapes the clutches of a murderer ) and the mall grab warning ( woman is lured into a van by way of a ruse involving a sick baby ), the gal in this story is put at risk via her desire to help someone she perceives as both harmless and in need of assistance . <PARA> this isn ’ t to say that children are never unwittingly involved in the schemes of rapists , but such incidents are few and far between rather than regular occurrences , and they don ’ t fit the narrative described here . for example , an accused rapist in pennsylvania was reported to have used a 4 - year - old boy in his custody as a method of establishing trust with the potential victims he met , and between 1989 and 1994 , at least eleven preteen girls in virginia were sexually assaulted by a man who approached them at playgrounds , near schools and in apartment complexes , usually pretending to be lost himself or searching for children with names such as monica or jessica . none of cases involved a rapist ’ s using a child pretending to be lost as a lure to bring women to him , however .	
unproven	the vatican customs surrounding the passing of a pope and the election of his successor seem mysterious to outsiders , both because of their arcane nature and because members of the general population gain exposure to them only at those rare instance in their own lifetimes when the pontiff dies . consequently , just about any act said to be part of those rituals seems somewhat believable . one particularly odd belief asserts that after the bishop of rome passes on , he is struck in the head with a silver hammer to confirm that he is well and truly gone and not merely sleeping soundly : <PARA> disagreement exists as to whether such a procedure is part of the parting process . we do know that once a pope appears to have left this world , a pronouncement is made in latin that he is dead , with this news certified by a physician . the camerlengo ( chamberlain ) calls out the pontiff ’ s baptismal name three times over the corpse in an effort to prompt a response . failing to get one , he defaces with a silver hammer that particular bishop of rome ’ s pescatorio ( ring of the fisherman ), along with the dies used to make lead seals for apostolic letters . the pope ’ s quarters are then sealed , and funeral arrangements are begun by the camerlengo . <PARA> some believe after the deceased has failed to answer to his name being called three times , and before his ring and seals are defaced , he is tapped on the forehead with a small silver hammer . that intelligence has been sped along by stephen bates , a journalist who penned a widely quoted - from article on rituals attaching to the passing of popes . <PARA> for instance , in 2003 the guardian quoted bates thus : <PARA> yet the guardian ran the following correction a few weeks later : <PARA> while many news outlets continue to tout the silver hammer information as factual ( which further adds to the confusion , as the resulting proliferation of articles appears to add credence to the claim , even though all such articles spring from the same wellhead ), some offer counter information , such as this snippet gleaned from a 2005 associated press report : <PARA> it is not inconceivable that at least at one time such a macabre test was administered , because history is dotted with numerous instances of those presumed to have passed away suddenly springing back to life . at one time , the fear of being misdiagnosed as dead and consequently being buried alive prompted some to specify in their wills their desire to have special tests performed on their bodies to make some sure they were actually deceased . <PARA> surgical incisions , the application of boiling hot liquids , touching red - hot irons to their flesh , stabbing them through the heart , or even decapitating them were all specified at different times as a way of making sure the presumably deceased didn ’ t wake up six feet under . some persons opted for being buried with the means to do themselves in , and guns , knives , and poison were sometimes packed into coffins along with the deceased . ( these days , given western society ’ s passion for embalming its departed loved ones , the chances of being prematurely buried are almost nil , because none so preserved stand a chance of surviving the process .) <PARA> in the wake of the death of pope john paul ii on 2 april 2005 , news outlets and other sources have issued a variety of contradictory statements about the use of a silver hammer in connection with a pope ’ s death : it ’ s an old , discontinued practice , or it remains a current practice ; the use of the hammer once served a functional purpose , or its use is ( and always has been ) purely symbolic . in light of these competing claims , we await a pronouncement from an identifiable ( i . e ., non - anonymous ) vatican official on the subject before declaring this one either ‘ true ’ or ‘ false .’ <PARA> one final note for those who are pondering the coincidence : the beatles song “ maxwell ’ s silver hammer ” has no connection to papal traditions involving a silver hammer . as steve turner noted in a hard day ’ s write , his volume on the origins of beatles songs :	
true	in february 2006 , baltimore circuit court judge m . brooke murdock ruled that a maryland state law banning same - sex marriages was unconstitutional . in response to that decision , state lawmakers opposed to same - sex marriage introduced a resolution to impeach judge murdock ( a move that was defeated in the judiciary committee ) and a bill calling for the amendment of maryland ’ s constitution to prohibit all same - sex marriages . <PARA> although the bill failed to garner sufficient support for passage , it was reintroduced in a version that would have defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman only but would still have allowed for same - sex civil unions . the latter bill was being debated by a senate committee on 1 march 2006 , when , according to the baltimore sun , “ clergy , constitutional law experts and children of gay parents were among those who packed the senate judicial proceedings committee room to speak out on the issue .” <PARA> part of that debate featured some give - and - take between nancy jacobs , a republican state senator , and jamin raskin , a professor of constitutional law from washington ’ s american university ( who was himself elected as a maryland state senator later in the year ) over the influence of the bible on modern law . the exchange was memorialized in a viral email : <PARA> the baltimore sun ‘ s reporting of the debate was slightly different : <PARA> based on the sun ‘ s account , we note that the version of events quoted in the viral email was somewhat altered and compressed to make the exchange more direct and personal ( i . e ., senator jacobs ’ statement about marriage and the bible has been simplified , and she did not issue a “ what do you have to say about that ?” challenge ; professor raskin ’ s response referred to people in general , not to senator jacobs specifically ; and although some spectators applauded , the room did not “ erupt into applause ”), but the setting and gist of professor raskin ’ s statement are correctly reported . <PARA> professor raskin wasn ’ t the first person to employ this form of quip , however . comedian bill maher said the following ( in reference to the terry schiavo case ) during the 1 april 2005 broadcast of his hbo television program , real time with bill maher : <PARA> and a 1997 article about congressman jesse jackson jr . of illinois reported him as offering a similar sentiment :	
unproven	origins : one of the facets we find most intriguing in other animals is their display of human - like behavior , particularly when they engage in actions that not only mimic our own but suggest a level of intelligence and complex emotional thoughts similar to our own . both those intellectual qualities are evinced through accounts in which female animals seemingly demonstrate both problem - solving abilities and a sense of compassion in the course of protecting their young from harm ( features that figure prominently in another legend about a bird ’ s sacrificing herself to shield her hatchlings from a fire ). <PARA> to know whether the photograph displayed above — purportedly showing a fawn whose mother cleverly camouflaged it during her temporary absence by leaving it on brown wooden steps littered with white apple blossom petals , a combination which perfectly matched the fawn ’ s tawny , white - spotted coat — fits this category , we would have to know all of the following : <PARA> since we don ’ t yet know the origins of this photograph , we can ’ t speak to any of these points , so this image is listed as ‘ undetermined ’ until additional information comes our way .

false	there is no more memorable figure in baseball history than babe ruth , and no more famously distinctive a uniform than the new york yankees ’ pinstriped home jerseys . ruth ’ s most notable home run records may have been broken , and other teams may have adopted the pinstriped look , but baseball still has no more potent symbols of sustained excellence than the babe and yankee pinstripes . <PARA> we might expect that someone would try to link these symbols in folkloric fashion , to establish a connection between the two that was not merely coincidental but causal . the bambino didn ’ t merely wear yankee pinstripes ; he was the reason why all yankees wear pinstripes , then and now : <PARA> this legend collides headlong with a few facts when we try to run it down history ’ s highway , however , and the first obstacle in the road has something to do with memory and image . <PARA> we tend to create specific , fixed images of people ( particularly famous ones ) and remember them always as conforming to those images . mark twain is nearly always depicted as an elderly , white - haired man in a white suit , even though twain was famous long before he was elderly , and he adopted the habit of wearing white suits all year around only in the last few years of his life . walt disney will forever be the avuncular , slightly paunchy middle - aged man with the gray moustache , because that ’ s how he looked when most of us first saw him regularly ( as the host of his own tv show ); that he was quite successful while still in his boyish 20s is easy to overlook , because he wasn ’ t very visible in those pre - television days . and abraham lincoln is forever enshrined in american memory as the bearded figure in a stovepipe hat , even though he bore facial hair only for the last four years of his life . <PARA> likewise , the popular image of babe ruth is that of a paunchy , roly - poly ballplayer who was lucky he could hit home runs , because otherwise he would have had a heck of a time trying to drag that spare tire around the basepaths . but this is an unrepresentative image of the babe , formed largely because of his reputation for having a prodigious appetite ( for food and everything else ), and because most of the existing films of him date from the last years of his career , when he was considerably overweight . although he may have been a bit oddly - shaped , for most of his baseball - playing days ruth was a big , solidly - muscled athlete who was well - proportioned at 6 ’ 2 ′′ and 215 lbs ., underwent a thorough training program before each season , and excelled at every aspect of the game . <PARA> moreover , as the following article from the 27 february 1912 new york times demonstrates , the yankees were not originators of the pinstriped uniform , and they first adopted that look several years before babe ruth became a member of the team : <PARA> the yankees abandoned pinstripes after the 1912 season , brought them back in 1915 ( in navy blue rather than black ), and have worn them ever since . in 1912 , however , babe ruth was a 17 - year - old resident of st . mary ’ s industrial school for boys in baltimore , and in 1915 he was just beginning his major league career as a pitcher with the boston red sox . ruth didn ’ t join the yankees until 1920 , red sox owner harry frazee having sold him to new york after the end of the 1919 season . in 1915 the babe was not a yankee nor was he overweight , so if new york started wearing pinstripes because of his supposed girth back then , they must have been prescient indeed . ( and apparently the yankees didn ’ t care about the babe ’ s looking fat to non - new yorkers , since the yankees ’ road uniforms remained plain gray with no striping .) <PARA> as ruth biographer marshall smelser noted , “ no other person outside of public life so stirred our imaginations or so captured our affections .” if we want to attribute to the babe even that which he wasn ’ t responsible for , well , perhaps it ’ s only a fitting part of his larger - than - life legend .	
false	we can ’ t all be famous , but many people who aren ’ t have tried the next best thing : associating themselves with someone famous . others , denied the opportunity even to hobnob with anyone of renown , have taken the process a step further and manufactured such associations themselves . a particularly prevalent genre of “ brush with fame ” legends involves those who claim to have had chance encounters with notable personages during their formative years , contributing something — an idea , a suggestion , or maybe just a helping hand — that had a lasting impact and aided those later - famous people in becoming successful in some artistic , scientific , or political endeavor . after all , the early lives of people who later become famous are often not well documented , making it difficult to dispute a claimant ’ s tale of a chance encounter way back when . <PARA> not surprisingly , walt disney is the subject of several such legends , in this case one having to do with the site of his birth and the origin of his given name . in 1982 , the robinson argus newspaper , based in robinson , illinois , published a local resident ’ s recollection of the putative circumstances surrounding walt ’ s birth : <PARA> it ’ s a charming story , but the logical holes in its premise and timeline are legion : <PARA> walt disney , of course , was not born until 1901 — this certificate , which documents a birth on 30 december 1890 , records the arrival of one of walt ’ s older brothers , raymond arnold disney . evidently mr . and mrs . disney considered naming one of their earlier children “ walter ” to the extent that that name was listed on the birth certificate , but they later changed their minds and named him “ raymond ” instead . the important point , however , is that this certificate documents the disneys had the name “ walter ” in mind for one of their sons a full eleven years before walt was born . <PARA> so , we leave off where we began , by noting that people sometimes manufacture their own brushes with greatness , as was evidently the case here . to mangle a familiar phrase : “ some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some fabricate greatness out of whole cloth .”	
false	humor can sometimes be an elusive concept . what ’ s funny to one person may not be funny to another , and what one person intends as humor may not be recognizable as such by someone else . sometimes when the line between humor and seriousness isn ’ t obvious , there ’ s not much to do other than ... explain the joke . <PARA> over the years we ’ re received a number of inquiries about a web page that purportedly describes a “ banned book of dr . seuss ,” a work by the beloved children ’ s author and illustrator supposedly since removed from print because of its decidedly un - child - friendly references to violence and suicide : <PARA> the joke is that although the book described — do you know what i ’ m going to do next saturday ? — is a real book once published by dr . seuss ’ s “ beginner books ” imprint , it was not written by dr . seuss himself , it was not banned , and it does not contain references to violence and suicide . <PARA> the creator of the “ banned book of dr . seuss ” page took the contents of a 40 - year - old children ’ s book and jocularly made parts of it sound disturbing by reproducing the text but omitting the photographs that provided necessary context , heightening the confusion by occasionally interjecting his own suggestive comments . <PARA> do you know what i ’ m going to do next saturday ? and other beginner books came about as a result of a 1954 life magazine article by john hersey entitled “ why do children bog down on the first r ?” in which hersey discussed the difficulties experienced by educators in teaching young children to read using the standard primers of the era . hersey felt that typical school readers were too “ uniform , bland , idealized and terribly literal ” to hold youngsters ’ attention in a world full of other entertainments ; he called for books featuring illustrations that “ widen rather than narrow the associative richness the children give to words ,” and suggested that works produced by artists such as theodor geisel and walt disney might be more effective educational fare for young readers . <PARA> theodor geisel , better known to the world as dr . seuss , later wrote that hersey had “ casually suggested in life that i was the type of writer who should write a first - grade reader . so , with innocent conceit , i said , ‘ why not ?'” as geisel explained in a typically seussian ( and somewhat fictionalized ) 1957 article entitled “ how orlo got his book ,” he agreed with some of hersey ’ s criticisms — too few books were written using vocabularies early readers could understand while remaining sufficiently challenging and interesting to appeal to young children : <PARA> the result of geisel ’ s efforts to write a book using no more than the few hundred words that comprise an average first grader ’ s reading vocabulary was , as noted , the cat in the hat — an instant best - seller and one of the most enduringly popular children ’ s books of all time ( now with more than 8 . 5 million copies in print ). geisel continued his efforts to produce limited - vocabulary works for young readers , efforts which culminated in the 1960 publication of green eggs and ham , another best - seller written using a mere fifty different words . by the end of the 1950s , geisel had been lauded as “ single - handedly changing the reading habits of thousands of american children .” <PARA> geisel ’ s success in this vein led to his creation in 1957 of beginner books ( later a division of random house ), an early - reader imprint specializing in similar works : limited - vocabulary “ i can read it all by myself ” books with appealing story lines and illustrations , aimed at encouraging children to read at as early an age as possible . although the beginner books logo featured the familiar cat in the hat character , and many of the imprint ’ s published entries ( hop on pop , fox in socks , one fish two fish red fish blue fish ) were written by geisel himself ( as dr . seuss ), some of the volumes were penned by other authors . for example , cartoonist p . d . eastman fashioned several whimsical animal - based tales published by beginner books ( sam and the firefly , are you my mother ?, go , dog . go !), works fondly recalled by generations of children who grew up with them and number them among their earliest reading efforts . <PARA> four of the beginner books were written by helen palmer , theodor geisel ’ s first wife . one of those books was a typical text - and - illustration tale about an overfed fish ( a fish out of water ), but the other three were something different — they combined palmer ’ s simple prose with the photographs of lynn fayman to relate some children ’ s fantasy stories , narrated in the first person by the children pictured . <PARA> in why i built the boogle house , a boy ’ s pets keep running away or causing trouble , each one of them replaced in turn by a new animal larger than the last . after continually re - building his pet house to accommodate the ever - larger animals , the boy finally constructs a house big enough to hold a boogle — a pet that will never cause him any trouble because it doesn ’ t exist . in i was kissed by a seal at the zoo , various childen describe the type of things they ’ d like to do during their visit to the zoo : play with a baby lion , read to a walrus , feed a goat , ride a turtle , etc . and in do you know what i ’ m going to do next saturday ?, first published in 1963 , a boy tells the world about all the activities he would engage in on a sunny saturday afternoon if he could turn his imagination into reality . <PARA> some of the prose in do you know what i ’ m going to do next saturday ? does sound a little odd if read without the context provided by its accompanying photographs , a feature the creator of the “ banned book ” page capitalized upon . for instance , at one point the child narrator declares : <PARA> this certainly could sound strange ( and perhaps slightly disturbing ) to a reader who didn ’ t know that the word “ beat ” as used here referred to triumphing in an athletic competition , a meaning made clear by pictures depicting the boy taking on five other kids at a game of tennis and playing a match of beach volleyball against several grown men : <PARA> likewise , the following lines are a little difficult to fathom when considered in isolation : <PARA> again , the pictures tell the story : two boys with sack lunches are hiking and playing in rural setting . during a dip in a pond , the narrator prankishly douses his swim trunk - clad friend , then teases him some more by leading him down a desert road ( a stroll turned into a “ hundred mile ” walk through typical little boy competitiveness ) before agreeing to stop and eat lunch : <PARA> even the innocuous can sound ominous when taken out of context : <PARA> the word “ horn ” is a clue here — when the boy describes how he plans to “ blow his head off ,” his words are set against a photograph showing him trying to muster enough air in his lungs to play a tuba : <PARA> do you know what i ’ m going to do next saturday ? was never “ banned ,” and nothing about it was really the least bit unwholesome — although attitudes have changed over the last forty years , and some parents might now consider descriptions and pictures of a young boy shooting guns on a firing range and drilling with marines to be inappropriate children ’ s fare . <PARA> although none of the photograph - based beginner books by helen palmer ( who died in 1967 ) proved as popular as her more traditional a fish out of water story , do you know what i ’ m going to do next saturday ? was well - regarded in its day and was selected by the new york times as one of the best juvenile books of 1963 .	
mixture	once again , the ecological doomsday bell has been set to tolling , this time by folks fearful of the imminent demise of our favorite fruit , the banana : <PARA> in january 2003 , a report in new scientist suggested bananas could well disappear within ten years thanks to two blights : black sigatoka , a leaf fungus , and panama disease , a soil fungus which attacks the roots of the plant . <PARA> bananas aren ’ t about to be swept from the face of the earth by a deadly pestilence poised to wipe them out ( and more than ten years has elapsed since that original report , yet bananas are still with us ). there are several hundred different varieties of the fruit , and the reported fear applies to only one of them , the cavendish . granted , the cavendish is our banana of choice and accounts for the overwhelming pronderance of banana exports and purchases , but it isn ’ t the only banana out there . even if the cavendish were lost to us , we would still not be singing “ yes , we have no bananas .” <PARA> the cavendish , the banana american consumers are most familiar with , has been threatened in some asian countries by a strain of fusarium wilt known as panama disease or tropical race 4 ( tr4 ). this soil - borne fungus attacks roots and cannot be controlled by fungicides ; and if race 4 were to reach cavendish plants in large - scale commercial plantations , it could have a devastating impact on the species . <PARA> bananas stand in greater peril from disease and insect damage than the majority of other fruits because they are sterile , seedless mutants . new plants are created from cuttings of existing ones , making them little more than clones of one another . without the natural diversity resulting from sexual reproduction , bananas continue on generation after generation with the same genetic makeup . their inability to mutate and adapt leaves them vulnerable to species - wide disaster , because what fells one of them will prove the undoing of every plant within that particular variety . in the 1960s the gros michel , then a hugely popular variety of banana , was wiped out by another strain of panama disease . the loss of the gros michel promoted the cavendish into the # 1 spot . <PARA> lack of genetic diversity does place the banana in a precarious position , and the danger posed by race 4 to the cavendish is real . ( sigatoka , while serious , provides less of a threat in that it can be successfully combated .) according to scientists and banana experts who attended the three - day seminar on conventional and alternative handling of common banana diseases held 7 - 10 august 2003 in guayaquil , ecuador , bananas were still far from global extinction . disease control alternatives such as the development of “ plants resistant to the main diseases ,” the employment of “ friendly - bacteria , fungi and other micro - organisms ,” and the increasing use of organic practices have contributed greatly to the successful control of feared banana plagues , they said . this echoes what was reported in february 2003 by a plant pathologist with the american phytopathological society ( aps ) in response to the controversial new scientist article that brought the plight of the cavendish to the public ’ s attention : <PARA> for race 4 to spread into the large plantations , either infected banana suckers or infested soil would have to be introduced into the growing fields . there was hope that forbidding practices that allowed this type of spread in banana export - producing countries , along with the starting of new plantations from pathogen - free , tissue cultured plants , would stop tr4 from reaching those plantations . however , news from mid - 2015 indicated that tr4 was still spreading , and that some of those perilous growing practices were still in place among banana farmers : <PARA> still , argiculturalists hope that even if tr4 can ’ t be eradicated , it can at least be contained : <PARA> bananas are a nutritional gold mine . at only 110 calories per 4 - ounce offering , they contain a mere trace of fat . they are high in vitamin b6 , which helps fight infection and is essential for the synthesis of heme , the iron - containing part of hemoglobin . they are also rich in potassium ( more than 400 mg per banana ) and are a great source of fiber . in recent years , a number of claims about their healthful benefits have surfaced , including that they combat warts , depression , and morning sickness . although the jury is still out on those benefits , this humble yellow - skinned fruit could lower the risk of heart attack and stroke as part of a heart - healthy diet and could potentially even lower the risk of cancer . or at least so says the fda . <PARA> bananas , by the way , grow on plants , not trees . one last bit of banana trivia : a bunch of bananas is properly styled a hand , and a single fruit a finger .	
false	few people who lived through events such as the japanese bombing of pearl harbor on 7 december 1941 or the terrorist attacks against america on 11 september 2001 would deny that they immediately recognized those events to be momentous ones — points at which history took a sudden left turn and unexpectedly headed off down a different path . not all events are recognizable as momentous at the moment they occur , however ; sometimes their historical significance is only evident in retrospect , after the passage of many years . <PARA> no one anticipated , for example , that when an 18 - year - old machine shop worker clutching a battered guitar walked into the office of the memphis recording service during the summer of 1953 and paid to record himself performing a couple of songs ( ostensibly as a gift for his mother ), elvis presley was on his way to becoming a towering figure in american popular music and a national icon . nor did anyone realize that when an 18 - year - old boy recently returned from a stint driving red cross ambulances in post - war france made his way to kansas city in 1919 and took a $ 50 / month job drawing farm equipment ads for the pesmen - rubin commercial art studio , walt disney had taken his first step towards founding a multi - million dollar entertainment empire . <PARA> likewise , in the world of sports , 2 june 1925 was not recognized as a significant date until many years later . that was the day on which a youngster out of columbia university , lou gehrig , took over first base duties for the new york yankees , holding the position for the next fourteen years and embarking on a hall of fame career that saw him play in an astounding 2 , 130 consecutive games — a streak that ended only when a fatal disease ( amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ) so eroded gehrig ’ s physical skills that he could no longer perform on the field . ( gehrig died two years later , and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , or als , is now commonly known as “ lou gehrig ’ s disease .”) <PARA> once that date came to be recognized as something significant , it also became the centerpiece of a baseball legend — gehrig got his big break only because wally pipp , the yankees ’ regular first baseman since 1915 , sat out a game with a headache : <PARA> ( technically gehrig ’ s streak began a day earlier when he entered a game as a pinch - hitter , but 2 june 1925 marked the beginning of his tenure as the yankees ’ first baseman .) <PARA> the pipp - gehrig legend is a cautionary tale for the ages : in those days baseball players were supposedly made of sterner stuff and played through injuries and pain ; a veteran wouldn ’ t dare to beg his manager for a day off unless he had a bone poking through his skin . but , legend has it , wally pipp allowed a minor ailment like a headache to keep him out of a game , and as a result he lost his starting job to a rookie , never got it back , and was traded away at the end of the season . if only pipp had been made of that sterner stuff , who knows what might have happened ? maybe he would have kept his job , gehrig would have quit or been traded , and the name wally pipp might now be remembered as something more than the answer to a trivia question . <PARA> as i ’ ve long been an avid fan of baseball history , my interest in the gehrig legend was piqued when i read a then - new book about babe ruth and came across a passage that suggested the accepted pipp - gehrig tale was all wrong : <PARA> hmm , i thought to myself , if it was true that wally pipp gave way to lou gehrig because his skull had been fractured by a batting practice pitch , and this was the first i ’ d heard of it despite having been a devoted baseball fan for 35 years , this sounded like the kind of story to write about . <PARA> the first step in the process of writing such an article was attempting to verify what i ’ d just read , so i picked up another baseball book , one which chronicled 100 years of new york yankee history , and flipped through it to see what it had to say about the events of 1925 : <PARA> so far , so good — two different sources said the same thing . but i knew from long experience that it ’ s always best to corroborate historical information found in secondary sources by referring to contemporaneous documentation whenever possible , so i searched issues of the new york times from 1925 to find an original article about pipp ’ s beaning . i soon discovered that the sources quoted above were wrong : wally pipp suffered his batting practice injury on 2 july ( not 2 june ) 1925 , a full month after he ’ d been supplanted at first base by lou gehrig , as the new york times reported on 3 july 1925 : <PARA> well , so much for that . but i still had to consider the possibility that even if pipp wasn ’ t suffering from the effects of a fastball to the head when he gave way to lou gehrig , he might still have had a headache that kept him on the bench that day . although the author of the babe ruth book quoted above was wrong about why pipp was taken out of the yankee line - up , he raised a good point in noting that the headache story didn ’ t surface until 14 years later ( presumably in a 1939 article about the end of gehrig ’ s streak ). i verified that the first mention of pipp ’ s having a headache on 2 june 1925 didn ’ t appear in the new york times until 1941 , in an article about lou gehrig ’ s death . <PARA> a long gap between occurrence and first reporting of an incident is one of the hallmarks of urban legendry , often an indicator that someone made up a fictitious story long after the fact , so the non - mention of pipp ’ s headache until 14 years later raised a red flag . of course , we wouldn ’ t necessarily expect to see such a story show up in the press right away , since nobody knew in 1925 that gehrig was going to set a record for consecutive games played ; several years elapsed before gehrig ’ s streak became noteworthy to the point that reporters would have started digging around for background on its origins . still , gehrig ’ s streak was noteworthy long before it ended — he obliterated the previous record of 1 , 307 consecutive games played in 1933 , and newpapers were tracking his streak at least as far back as 1930 , so why didn ’ t the headache story surface in the press earlier than 1939 , the year gehrig ’ s streak finally came to a halt ? <PARA> while researching this item , i came across an intriguing statement at the end of a retelling of this story in a new york times article about gehrig ’ s death : <PARA> the last few sentences indicate that there was some doubt over the authenticity of the “ headache ” explanation as far back as 1941 , and that pipp and gehrig had made contradictory statements about its truthfulness . the latter point would tend to support the story as true : pipp seemingly had no reason to confirm a story that was somewhat embarrassing for him ( i . e ., he lost his starting job because of a headache ), while gehrig seemingly did have motive to deny it ( i . e ., he would want to be seen as a player who earned his starting spot through hard work and superlative skills , not because he happened to be in the right place when someone else came down with a minor ailment ). still , that wasn ’ t much to go on . <PARA> a little more digging revealed the source of the confusion that took in later writers : a 1953 article in which wally pipp himself misremembered the sequence of events surrounding his injury and his replacement by gehrig : <PARA> it ’ s hard to explain how a man who claimed to remember even “ unimportant trifles ” could mix up such significant milestones in his life as losing his starting job with the new york yankees and nearly dying from a batting practice beaning , events that occurred a full month apart , but evidently he did . perhaps his memory simply waned with the passage of time , or perhaps he unconsciously ( or even deliberately ) conflated two different events to come up with one story that reflected his past in a better light . <PARA> ( back in pipp ’ s day sportswriters often resorted to euphemism to express things they could not say directly — for example , a player who missed a game due to a hangover might be said to have been suffering from “ the flu ” or “ a headache .” therefore , pipp might have sought to preserve his reputation by making it clear that any “ headaches ” he suffered while a player had specific medical causes and were not alcohol - related .) <PARA> still , nothing i uncovered to this point definitively established whether or not wally pipp sat out the game of 2 june 1925 because he had a headache . another avenue of thought then occurred to me : if pipp truly skipped a game due to a headache , why wasn ’ t he back in the starting line - up a day or two later ? he was the yankees ’ regular first baseman ( and had been for over ten years ), and it wasn ’ t the case that gehrig was so immediately impressive that yankee manager miller huggins never considered taking him out of the line - up again . in fact , huggins pulled gehrig for a pinch - hitter several times that first month , and on 11 july the new york times noted that huggins was not yet bowled over by gehrig ’ s prowess at the plate : <PARA> so if the only thing wrong with pipp was a headache , why didn ’ t he play another game at first base after gehrig finally got a chance to start at the position ? the answer is found by considering the context of what was going on with the yankees in 1925 . <PARA> after winning three straight american league pennants between 1921 - 23 , the yankees finished a couple of games off the pace in 1924 as the washington senators captured their first flag ever . new york expected to regain the top spot in 1925 , but that was the year babe ruth ’ s excesses finally caught up with him . the yankee slugger had allowed his weight to balloon to a hefty 260 pounds during the off - season ( his normal playing weight at the time was about 215 ), he fell ill during spring training , and he finally collapsed on a train as the yankees were heading north to start the season . the bambino was hospitalized for several weeks with a mysterious ailment ( rumors about the true cause of his condition include a severe case of gonorrhea , exhaustion , influenza , poor diet , a hernia , and alcoholism ) and missed the first two months of the season , and even after he returned he was weak and relatively ineffective for the rest of the year . ( in 1925 ruth batted . 290 with only 25 home runs and 66 rbi , his lowest totals ever until his final year with the yankees .) <PARA> with ruth either missing or too weak to play at full capacity , and some key players slumping ( second baseman aaron ward and catcher wally schang were both in their last full seasons with the yankees ), new york tumbled to a dismal seventh - place finish ( in an eight - team league ) in 1925 . with his team already near the bottom of the standings and eleven games under the . 500 mark at the beginning of june , manager miller huggins decided to shake up his line - up and replace some of his slumping veterans with younger players . contemporaneous news accounts leave no doubt that wally pipp did not sit out the game on 2 june 1925 with a headache ; he was deliberately benched by a manager who had charge of a team that was playing poorly and who opted to sit down some of his older players to give others a try . <PARA> the new york times published the following account of gehrig ’ s first game as a starter on 3 june 1925 : <PARA> another times report from later in the week reinforced that miller huggins had altered his line - up by removing several older veterans ( including pipp ) who were underperforming in order to give younger players a chance to get in the game : <PARA> in the case of wally pipp there was no inopportune headache , no “ delightful and romantic story ” — just a case of a slumping player who lost his job to an up - and - comer and never got it back . but his replacement was the stuff of legend ( the indestructible ballplayer finally felled by a fatal disease ), and so he became part of a legend that mixed fact and fiction and grew so large even some of the participants came to believe in its fictional aspects .	
false	a brash young lawyer - turned - journalist named geraldo rivera burst upon the new york news scene in the early 1970s as a reporter for wabc - tv , and by 1972 he had garnered national acclaim and an emmy award for his series of investigative reports exposing deplorable conditions at the willowbrook state school for the mentally ill , which led to a government investigation of the facility , court intervention , and the subsequent closing of much of the institution while reforms were implemented . <PARA> after this promising beginning , however , much of the viewing public became disenchanted with rivera as he moved through higher - profile national stints on abc ( goodnight , america ; good morning , america ; and 20 / 20 newsmagazine ) and nbc ( geraldo ), where he was perceived as eschewing the substantive in favor of the sensational , the tawdry , and the bizarre in segments such as “ devil worship : exploring satan ’ s underground ” ( an excuse for airing more pointless and rambling interview footage with charles manson ), “ the mystery of al capone ’ s vault ” ( a live , two - hour tease for the opening of the famous gangster ’ s vault , which yielded nothing but a few old bottles ), and an on - air talk show brawl with neo - nazis which left geraldo with a broken nose when he was hit in the face with a chair . <PARA> rivera ’ s image problems continued during his work for fox news : while covering american military activity in afghanistan in 2001 he was criticized for taking a gun into a war zone and derided for misplacing the scene of a “ friendly fire ” incident by 300 miles ( he later said he has confused two different incidents , although the other incident didn ’ t take place until three days after his report ), and while covering the war in iraq in 2003 he was censured by the u . s . military ( and reportedly booted out of iraq ) for broadcasting details that revealed tactical information about an upcoming u . s . attack . <PARA> of all the professional criticisms leveled at geraldo rivera over the years , one of the most common is also the one of the most unfair — the claim he was born jerry rivers and shamelessly adopted the stage name “ geraldo rivera ” to appeal to latino viewers and stand out from the crowd by claiming a counterfeit ethnicity : <PARA> although geraldo rivera was known by some slight variations of his given name in his younger days , those variations were not the product of a crass effort on his part to “ appear more ethnic ” by turning a distinctly anglo name into a latino one . rather , they came about through his having parents from different ethnic backgrounds who meddled with their own names and their children ’ s to accommodate others , through differences between english and spanish versions of common names , and through people ’ s natural tendency to use nicknames in place of formal names when addressing relatives and other close acquaintances . <PARA> geraldo rivera ’ s father , cruz rivera , was the son of a puerto rican sugar plantation worker . after immigrating to new york , cruz married a jewish woman named lilly friedman , touching off the first of the rivera family ’ s name changes : <PARA> but even though geraldo ’ s family name was unquestionably rivera , his mother ’ s finagling with the birth certificates of her children created a confusing situation in which geraldo and some of his siblings bore surnames different than the family name : <PARA> yearbook photos from geraldo ’ s high school and college ( the university of arizona ) document that his name was never jerry rivers — his given name was indeed gerald , and his surname alternated between the family name , rivera , and his mother ’ s “ continentalized ” spelling of it , riviera : <PARA> as one would expect , friends and acquaintances took to calling him by the less formal gerry , while relatives on his father ’ s side of the family knew him as geraldo , the spanish equivalent of gerald . according to geraldo himself , the epiphany which led to his opting for one version of his surname over the other occurred in his early 20s , while he was working as an assistant manager in a south bronx department store : <PARA> the final alteration came in 1969 when geraldo rivera , by then a law school graduate and a practicing lawyer , came to the attention of wabc - tv through his representation of the young lords , a puerto rican activist group : <PARA> while one might find much to criticize about rivera ’ s reportorial techniques , his ethnicity is genuine . his father ’ s surname was rivera , his given name was gerald , and the only concession he made to fashion was to agree to go by the spanish pronunciation of his given name to satisfy an employer who wanted an identifiably puerto rican reporter . in the world of television , that ’ s practically a refreshing authenticity .	
false	the image accompanying the text quoted above is real in the sense that it is indeed a photograph taken during a revolutionary fetal procedure undertaken on 19 august 1999 to fix the spina bifida lesion of a 21 - week - old fetus in the womb . the operation was performed by a surgical team at vanderbilt university in nashville which developed a technique for correcting fetal problems in mid - pregnancy by temporarily removing the uterus , draining the amniotic fluid , performing surgery on the tiny fetus , then restoring the uterus back inside the mother . <PARA> the patient shown above , samuel armas , was the 54th fetus operated on by the surgical team ; dr . joseph bruner , the surgeon whose hands are pictured above , alleviated the effects of the opening in samuel ’ s spine caused by the spina bifida , a congenital disease that often leads to paralysis and other problems . pictures from the surgery were printed in a number of newspapers in the u . s . and around the world , including usa today , and thanks to the remarkable surgical procedure performed by the nashville team little samuel was born healthy on 2 december 1999 . <PARA> however , it is not true , as described in the accompanying text , that these photographs were taken as samuel ’ s hand “ emerged from the mother ’ s uterus to grasp the finger of dr . joseph bruner as if thanking the doctor for the gift of life ,” or that dr . bruner said “ when his finger was grasped , it was the most emotional moment of his life .” this misinformation has been propagated by many different sources , including the michael clancy , the photographer who snapped the pictures : <PARA> what actually took place , as described in news reports of the surgery , was that “[ j ] ust as surgeon dr . joseph bruner was closing the incision in julie armas ’ uterus , samuel ’ s thumbnail - sized hand flopped out . bruner lifted it gently and tucked it back in .” 2 <PARA> the surgeon , dr . bruner , later elaborated on some of the exaggerated and false claims made about the photograph : <PARA> ( the dubious veracity of the photographer ’ s version of events is highlighted by the disclaimer he appended to it on his web site , stating that it represented his “ opinion of the events as they took place during the surgery for samuel .”)	
false	here is another case of photographs circulated with explanatory text that was nothing more than someone ’ s fabricated commentary , although pictures themselves were real : <PARA> no pet groomer of our acquaintance is familiar with something called a ‘ line cut ’ ( thus the story about a cat owner ’ s southern accent resulting in confusion over a ‘ line cut ’ vs . a ‘ lion cut ’ is just a funny invention ), but a ‘ lion cut ‘ is indeed a standard grooming technique in which a cat ’ s hair is shaved skin - close all over the body but left intact around the head , feet , and the end of the tail ; the style so named because it mimics the large mane and foot - and - tail tufts of a male lion : <PARA> lion cuts are sometimes performed for practical reasons , particularly when a cat ’ s fur has become too matted to brush or comb out and has to be cut right down to the hair line to remove the knots and tangles . additionally , some cat owners favor periodic lion cuts for their pets because they believe domestic felines ( especially long - haired varieties such as persians ) benefit from growing out whole new coats of fur every once in a while ; others simply like the look of the lion cut for aesthetic reasons . <PARA> on the other hand , some feline advocates feel that lion cuts performed purely for cosmetic purposes cause cats a good deal of unnecessary discomfort afterwards , and that this type of grooming should be reserved for situations when matting or other damage to a cat ’ s fur makes it necessary . <PARA> some viewers maintained that the photographs displayed above must have been manipulated because the cat ’ s head looked too ridiculously big and out of proportion to the rest of its body . however , domestic cats ( like many small , furry animals ) look much larger to us than they really are because their thick coats create an illusion of bulk . we ’ re not used to seeing them without hair , and when we do it ’ s quite a shock — especially when , as in this case , the coat is cut in a fashion that emphasizes the contrast in apparent size between a hairless torso and areas surrounded by luxurious growths of fur .	
mixture	we began seeing this form of cautionary tale about automobile cruise control systems turn up in inboxes in november 2002 : <PARA> although these accounts are probably “ real ” in the sense that they indeed reflect someone ’ s attempt to describe an automotive mishap that actually happened to him , the explanation about a hydroplaning car ’ s suddenly accelerating and “ taking off like a rocket ” due to the use of cruise control is a garbled one probably reflecting the author ’ s misunderstanding of what had occurred . <PARA> nonetheless , the warning inherent to the tale — don ’ t engage your vehicle ’ s cruise control on slippery or wet roads — is well worth heeding . snow , ice , slush , or even rain can cause wheel - spin and loss of control , situations to which drivers must react quickly . although cruise control can generally be cut off by the driver ’ s simply tapping the brake pedal , the extra reaction time required for a motorist relying upon cruise control to recognize the danger of the situation when his wheels begins to spin or slide on a slippery surface , bring his foot up off the floor to the brake pedal , and disengage the cruise control can be crucial ( especially for drivers lured into a hazardous level of inattentiveness on long , flat stretches of road ). <PARA> according to the insurance corporation of british columbia ’ s web page of tips about driving on wet roads : <PARA> an example from the weekly “ drive it forever ” automotive column by new york times syndicate writer bob sikorsky provided a description of one such occurrence : <PARA> wet - road driving is fraught with dangers that are not always immediately apparent . just a thin layer of water lying on pavement can send an unsuspecting car hydroplaning into another lane — the car ’ s wheels skim along the water ’ s surface instead of making contact with the road . also , roads constantly accumulate oily substances loosed by car exhaust , and this residue settles deep into the pavement . rain brings this oil back to the surface , making roads especially slippery during that first hour of downpour or misting . <PARA> likewise , winter driving carries with it a similar set of perils . ice , snow , and sleet can make for dangerously slippery conditions , but so too can innocuous - looking slush and all - but - invisible “ black ice .” those who habitually rely upon their vehicles ’ cruise controls should eschew the practice during the winter months , because the moments it takes to disengage cruise may be moments you don ’ t have during a spin - out .	
false	a rush limbaugh piece from march 2002 ( below ) contrasted the compensation paid to families of september 11 victims with benefits paid to families of u . s . military personnel killed on active duty . although most of the figures cited in the article were accurate at the time it was written , subsequent changes have made much of the original article outdated : <PARA> family members of september 11 victims ( which include those killed at the world trade centers , the pentagon , and the shanksville , pennsylvania , crash site ) could apply to receive compensation from the victim compensation fund ( vcf ) established by the federal government . the ( non - taxable ) compensation amount included $ 250 , 000 ( plus an additional $ 100 , 000 for the spouse and each dependent of the victim ) in non - economic losses , plus additional compensation for economic loss determined by factors such as the victim ’ s age and income level . as of april 2004 , more than $ 2 . 6 billion in compensation had been paid out , with the families of deceased victims receiving an average of $ 1 . 8 million each . <PARA> in contrast , back in 2002 the figures listed on the military ’ s death benefits chart regarding benefits provided to the families of service members who died or were killed on active duty were paltry by comparison : <PARA> since then , however , the amount of the death gratuity has been increased to a non - taxable $ 100 , 000 ( retroactive to 7 october 2001 ), and the dic amounts have been raised to an $ 1 , 154 monthly annuity plus an additional $ 286 monthly allowance for each dependent child ( effective 1 december 2008 for veterans who died on or after 1 january 1993 ). <PARA> also , the original piece didn ’ t mention that military personnel are automatically insured ( unless they decline the coverage ) under the servicemembers ’ group life insurance ( sgli ) program , which at the time paid a maximum benefit of $ 250 , 000 to the families of servicemen killed while on active service — the same as the base amount paid through the vcf to the families of civilians killed in the september 11 terrorist attacks . the maximum sgli benefit has since been increased to $ 400 , 000 . <PARA> we note that service members have to pay premiums for sgli ( currently $ 27 per month for the maximum coverage ), and that many of the civilians killed in the 9 / 11 terrorist attacks also had life insurance policies which paid benefits to their surviving family members . <PARA> this piece has also been circulated with a coda that looks like it was tacked on by someone else , possibly as a commentary on the article which has now mistakenly been assumed to be a part of the original article itself : <PARA> the claim that congressmen can receive lavish pensions after serving only a single term in congress ( eventually totaling into the millions of dollars ) and that they neither pay into nor receive benefits from the social security fund is misinformation already covered in a separate article on this site . ( as of 2007 , the average annuity for retired members of congress was between about $ 36 , 000 and $ 63 , 000 .)	
false	just as it ’ s difficult for anyone who didn ’ t experience the early days of television to realize now that arthur godfrey was one of america ’ s premier entertainers during the 1950s , so is it difficult for anyone whose only exposure to the long - running police drama dragnet is “ nick at nite ” reruns of its late 1960s revival to appreciate how popular and influential a program it was . <PARA> dragnet , acclaimed for its attention to detail and realistic portrayal of the nuts and bolts of police work , was created by its star , jack webb . it started out as a radio drama in 1949 , made the transition to television in 1951 ( and aired in both media simultaneously through 1957 ), became a feature film in 1954 , spawned a revival tv series and made - for - tv movie in 1966 , was spoofed in a 1987 movie starring dan akroyd and tom hanks , and was spun off yet again ( after webb ’ s death ) as a new syndicated series in 1989 . <PARA> the popularity and influence of dragnet is attested to by the number of dragnet - related items that have become firmly embedded in our pop culture idiom : the distinctive “ dum - de - dum - dum ” opening four notes of its theme music ; the characters ’ rapid - fire , staccato delivery of dialogue ; the somber “ the story you are about to hear is true ; the names have been changed to protect the innocent ” intonation of its prologue ; and , of course , sgt . joe friday ’ s famous business - like catch phrase , “ just the facts , ma ’ am .” <PARA> well , about that last item . . . <PARA> our language is replete with famous phrases from historic and literary characters who never uttered the words attributed to them : marie antoinette and “ let them eat cake ”; cary grant and “ judy , judy , judy . . .”; sherlock holmes and “ elementary , my dear watson .” sometimes the phrases are made up out of whole cloth ( because they sounded like something those people would say ), and sometimes they ’ re corruptions or rephrasings of something that actually was said . “ just the facts , ma ’ am ” is a case of the latter . <PARA> so popular was dragnet in its day that satirist stan freberg spoofed it on a 1953 record titled “ st . george and the dragonet .” this record and its flip side , “ little blue riding hood ” ( also a dragnet spoof ) were extraordinarily popular as well , hitting the # 1 spot on billboard ‘ s pop chart and selling over two million copies ; the record ’ s success prompted ed sullivan to invite freberg to perform both sides of the single live on his talk of the town variety show . <PARA> jack webb ’ s ‘ joe friday ’ character typically used the phrase “ all we want are the facts , ma ’ am ” ( and sometimes “ all we know are the facts ma ’ am ”) when questioning women in the course of police investigations . freberg ’ s “ little blue riding hood ” spoof changed the line slightly , and it was freberg ’ s alteration — rather than anything joe friday said — that would enter the roll of immortal catch phrases : <PARA> webb biographer michael j . hayde described the transition :	
false	one of the many bits of “ secret ” information that history buffs love to pass around is the rumor that the seal of the president of the united states undergoes a surreptitious change in wartime , with the regular seal being swapped for slightly a different version in which the eagle ’ s head is turned to face the talon clutching a group of arrows ( rather than facing the talon holding an olive branch , the symbol of peace ) as a subtle visual reminder that the nation is at war . <PARA> this rumor has been made familiar to modern audiences through its mention in the political television drama the west wing , as well as its inclusion in author dan brown ’ s 2002 political thriller deception point : <PARA> although the seal of the president of the united states has undergone various changes over the years , its design is fixed by executive order and is not altered during wartime , as white house curator bill allman explained in response to a july 2004 query : <PARA> a video posted to the obama white house youtube channel provides further evidence : <PARA> the last paragraph of the above - quoted response might provide a clue as to how this rumor began . the great seal of the united states includes a coat of arms featuring an eagle clutching thirteen arrows in one talon and an olive branch in the other , its head facing to the viewer ’ s left , towards the talon with the olive branch . presidential flags had historically featured a similar coat of arms , but in 1916 president woodrow wilson issued an executive order that changed the design slightly , such that the eagle ’ s head was modified face to the viewer ’ s right , towards the talon holding the arrows : <PARA> the coat of arms on the presidential flag changed again in 1945 when president harry truman issued executive order 9646 , which made several alterations to the presidential flag and seal , among which was the reversal of the eagle ’ s head so that it once more faced in the same direction as the one on the great seal of the united states : <PARA> as biographer david mccullough noted of truman ’ s motivation for making the change : <PARA> possibly , in retrospect , some people recalled that the eagle on the presidential flag or seal had changed around the time of world war i ( president wilson ’ s executive order was issued eleven months before the u . s . entered that conflict ) then changed again just after world war ii ( president truman ’ s executive order was issued less than two months after the formal surrender of japan ), and they mistakenly assumed the events were connected rather than coincidental : a casual observer , unaware that the presidential flag had not been altered at the end of world war i or the beginning of world war ii , might have surmised that the eagle ’ s head had always faced towards the olive branch , and its occasional reversal was a wartime aberration . <PARA> the notion of a presidential seal that featured as its centerpiece an eagle whose gaze changed direction based upon the state of belligerency in the world was the subject of a wry comment made by british prime minister winston churchill as he was visiting with president truman in 1946 :	
unproven	a ubiquitous “ handy man ” legend is probably best viewed as a homily that amply demonstrates the difference between the value of an action and of the knowledge behind the action : <PARA> anyone who has handed his car over to a mechanic knows the lesson of this legend very well . with a few smooth moves , a skilled grease monkey can strike straight to the heart of that annoyingly disturbing sound the car owner was baffled by . ultimately , the solution may come down to a matter of tightening a few errant screws , and thus seem ( on the surface , at least ) to have not required all that much effort . but even as he winces over the bill , the car owner is struck by the realization if the problem had been left solely with him , he ’ d never have solved it or even known where to have begun . <PARA> in the 1880s , james macneill whistler , as plaintiff in a libel action , was challenged , “ for two days ’ labour , you ask two hundred guineas ?” “ no , i ask it for the experience of a lifetime .” that seems an apt summary of the message of this legend . <PARA> the value of work can appear contradictory in that those who are visibly busy frequently earn but a fraction of those who seem to not be doing all that much . judged by the eye alone , the secretary who can at the end of the day point to the stack of letters she typed would appear to be worth more than the executive who at the end of the same day can display no physical manifestations of what she ’ s spent her time on . equally , one who flips burgers and fills orders appears far more productive to the naked eye than the manager in charge of the place . <PARA> what is the value of a task ? as this legend points out , performing the actual labor can easily be the smallest part of the process , with the real value lying in correctly diagnosing the problem and coming up with a viable solution to it . ultimately , a task is worth whatever the person who needs it performed is willing to pay , whether the work is cerebral or manual . <PARA> getting back to our legend , we find that at various junctures the basic story will appear in a reworked format , now starring a different famous name . lore is often migratory , and anecdotes tend to gravitate towards the person they would most likely apply to . ergo , a parable about a workman ’ s worth will tend to affix itself to tesla or edison , inventive geniuses who went hands on with the mechanical world . <PARA> our tale wasn ’ t always attributed only to famous men , though ; often the unnamed mechanic , plumber , or electrician steps to the forefront to take his bow : <PARA> sightings : in may 2018 , the facebook page humans at sea attracted more than ten million views with a video - based version of the tale titled “ story of an old man .” that iteration told the same story about an “ old man ” who had been “ fixing ships since he was a youngster ”: <PARA> variations :	
false	just about every field of endeavor whose practioners are necessarily placed in the public eye ( e . g ., politics , entertainment , sports ) has a common set of “ denigration legends ” — just pick the out - of - favor personality of the moment , slap his or her name into a familiar anecdote , and voilà ... you have a ready - made , time - tested , believable “ true story ” guaranteed to make anyone sound like the one of the biggest boobs on the planet . that such anecdotes are usually fictitious ( or at the very least don ’ t involve the people to whom they are later ascribed ) doesn ’ t seem to detract from the fun . <PARA> in the acting world , the legend about an actress whose performance in the lead role of a stage production of the the diary of anne frank was so woefully bad that fed - up audience members gleefully shouted “ she ’ s in the attic !” when nazi soldier characters arrived on stage at the end of the play to haul off the hiding frank family has been applied to any number of female thespians perceived by the public as talentless hacks who landed starring roles only through their looks and / or their connections , not because of their ( marginal ) acting abilities : <PARA> throughtout the 1980s and 1990s , this anecdote was most persistently associated with actress / singer pia zadora ( although for a brief period it was also attached to vanna white , the letter - turning hostess of television ’ s wheel of fortune game show , who received scathing reviews when she tried her hand at acting by starring as venus in the 1988 made - for - tv movie goddess of love ). <PARA> why pia zadora ? at the time , ms . zadora was a well known celebrity of modest talent who had achieved prominence through the efforts of a wealthy benefactor . her acting career consisted mainly of small , unimportant parts in broadway productions until she married meshulam riklis , a mega - millionaire thirty years her senior , in 1977 . <PARA> through her well - to - do husband ’ s influence , pia became a familiar face due to her appearances as the dubonnet girl in print ads and television commercials for the dubonnet brand of apéritif wines ( which were distributed by a company owned by riklis ) and eventually landed a role in the 1981 film butterfly , a performance that won her a golden globe award as 1981 ’ s “ best new star of the year .” <PARA> however , rumors soon begin to circulate that pia ’ s husband had “ bought ” her golden globe award by funding lavish junkets to las vegas for members of the hollywood foreign press association , and outside the golden globe community pia ’ s butterfly performance was somewhat less critically acclaimed , garnering her two golden raspberry awards ( commonly known as “ razzies “) in 1982 for “ worst actress ” and “ worst new star .” she then achieved even more notoriety by winning the “ worst actress ” award again the following year for her lead role in the film version of harold robbins ’ the lonely lady , a movie that was nominated for a record eleven golden raspberry awards ( including “ worst picture of the decade ”). that pair of dubious performances led to ms . zadora ’ s being named the golden raspberrys ’ “ worst new star of the decade ” for 1980 - 1989 . <PARA> whatever one might think of pia zadora ’ s acting abilities ( save for a few bit parts , her film career ended with 1984 ’ s voyage of the rock aliens ), this tale doesn ’ t ring true about her : she never had a starring role in a stage version of the diary of anne frank — on broadway , off - broadway , or anywhere else . moreover , every telling of this anecdote we ’ ve encountered is either related in a vague , indefinite way ( i . e ., it involved some unnamed actress and took place sometime in the indefinite past ) or was clearly a case of someone ’ s repeating a good story he heard as if it were an event he actually witnessed . <PARA> take , for example , the version of this legend cited at the head of this article , which appeared in a book written by comedian george burns in 1996 . it ’ s highly unlikely that , as he claimed , george burns ever made a movie with an actress who was taunted by the audience while she was playing the lead in the diary of anne frank , as burns didn ’ t appear in a theatrical film between 1939 ( before anne frank even started keeping a diary ) and 1975 ( by which time this legend was already well - traveled ). moreover , at no point in a standard staging of the diary of anne frank do nazi soldiers or german police characters appear on stage looking for anne frank and inquiring into her whereabouts — they ’ re simply an unseen presence heard pounding on the downstairs door of the annex in which the frank family and other fugitives are hiding at the end of the play ’ s penultimate scene , and thus there ’ s no chance for the “ she ’ s in the attic !” punchline to be delivered live as a jeering taunt . <PARA> this legend is an amusing but apocryphal “ bad actress ” story . <PARA> sightings : in an episode of tv ’ s the golden girls , dorothy zbornak ( bea arthur ) delivers this legend as a standard put - down of an actress her roommates have engaged for the lead in a community theatre production : <PARA> in the 1988 jay mcinerney ’ s novel story of my life , allison ’ s acting teacher tells the urban legend of an unnamed actress who was being bankrolled by “ a rich guy who wanted to make her a big star so he was basically buying her the starring roles in these plays .”	
false	the “ kentucky fried rat ” tale is one of the hoariest of food contamination urban legends : <PARA> some elements of its spread are easy to explain . within the context of fast food restaurants , the offending eatery has to be a fried chicken outlet in order for the rat to be suitably disguised as a piece of food . once the restaurant is established as one that serves fast - food chicken , it becomes kfc because , as folklorist gary alan fine writes , “ the frequency of attachment of an urban legend to the largest company or corporation is so common as to be considered a law of urban folklore .” ( these days , however , kfc outlets receive their chicken pieces pre - battered , and thus one of them could not “ accidentally ” batter and fry a rat .) <PARA> the choice of a rat as a contaminant is also easy : rats have turned up in food products before ; they ’ re the right size and shape to be mistaken for pieces of chicken ( especially when fried in batter ); and rats are vermin , symbols of filth and decay . the fact that the rat - chicken is usually eaten in the dark is a plot device to prevent premature discovery of the “ secret ,” although some might consider it an important symbolic aspect of the legend . <PARA> so , what does this legend have to say ? as our society becomes more urbanized ( and frenetic ), we become less and less involved with the preparation of our own food , frequently dining out instead of eating at home , scarfing a quick meal rather than enjoying a leisurely one , and leaving the food preparation entirely in the hands of others . and these others are not local restaurateurs we know well , but anonymous corporate fast food franchisees and their faceless employees . the combination of our guilt at abdicating this responsibility and our mistrust of corporations is expressed as fear that fast food entities who don ’ t care about us will serve us tainted food prepared under unsanitary conditions , due to carelessness , laziness , or sheer malice . <PARA> women are most often the victim in this legend probably because they are considered more vulnerable than men , but perhaps also because this tale reinforces the notion that women have abdicated their traditional role as the family ’ s meal preparers ( with tragic results ). the ultimate in impersonal endings occurs when the victims file a lawsuit against the restaurant . a personal apology or settlement is no longer feasible : the impersonal corporate franchise must be battled in the equally impersonal civil court system . <PARA> in the “ you deserve a beak today ” category , on 28 november 2000 , a breaded deep - fried chicken head was reportedly found in a box of chicken wings purchased at a mcdonald ’ s in newport news , virginia . katherine ortega said she discovered the mcnoggin while divvying up the wings at home for her family of four . ( fried chicken wings were being test - marketed in that area .) <PARA> on 30 november 2000 , the ortegas announced they had hired a lawyer and were contemplating a lawsuit against mcdonald ’ s . legal experts didn ’ t think the family would win an award much higher than a couple of thousand dollars ( even if the fried chicken head were real ) because no one ate the piece or was physically harmed by it . <PARA> katherine ortega posed for a number of photographs of her holding the chicken head , and those who viewed the pictures noted that the fried batter on the item looked to be the same as that used with the chicken wings . the mcnoggin , however , was never examined by experts . john e . smith , owner of the mcdonald ’ s in question and two others , stated at the time that “ my ability to conduct a thorough investigation has been delayed because i have not been given an opportunity to examine the object in question . although i have made several requests to see this object , the customer refuses to give me that opportunity .” <PARA> an enforcement officer at the u . s . department of agriculture who looked into the case was at a loss to explain how a chicken head could have ended up in ortega ’ s order of wings . the first thing that happens in the processing of live chickens into poultry parts is their beheading , with the heads immediately being discarded . the carcasses then go on to the next stage ( which is being dropped into the boiling water to de - feather them ). though the process is mostly mechanized , a plant operator helps with evisceration ( the removal of the bird ’ s internal organs ) and an on - site usda inspector is supposed to check each and every chicken . the chances that a chicken head could have made it through this process are very small . <PARA> as far as we know , it never was determined if katherine ortega was a deliberate participant in a hoax , if a poultry plant worker or mcdonald ’ s employee thought he ’ d have himself an innocent bit of fun , or if something went severely wrong with the food processing procedures at the plant and thus a mcnoggining actually took place . <PARA> in september 2003 , tony hill , a pastor in baltimore , claimed he bit into a batter - fried mouse at a popeye ’ s fried chicken outlet in that town . popeye ’ s declined to comment on the matter , but the city health commissioner stated at the time that the popeye ’ s outlet in question had had rodent infestation problems before and had been closed two other times for infestation or unsanitary conditions . as far as we know , no resolution to this case was reported . <PARA> in june 2015 , devorise dixon of watts , california , posted a photograph to facebook of what he claimed was a batter - fried rat found in a box of kfc chicken tenders : <PARA> kfc indicated via facebook that they were investigating the issue but had seen no evidence to support the claim and had been unable to reach mr . dixon : <PARA> later , kfc corporate declared this claim to be a hoax :	
false	good legends never die ; they simply morph to fit the changing times . way back when , in less sexually open times , the guys in high school who weren ’ t getting any ( which was most of them ) would tell salacious and spiteful tales about those ubiquitous symbols of youthful sexual desire : cheerleaders . if you couldn ’ t have them , the next best thing was to dismiss them as tawdry sluts of easy virtue so lacking in moral that they would perform disgusting sexual acts ( e . g ., oral sex ) on an entire football team a la clara bow . as in all good “ sour grapes ” tales , these tarts got their comeuppance when their deviant behavior caused them to fall ill , requiring trips to the hospital where astonishing amounts of semen were pumped from their stomachs , revealing their nasty little sexual proclivities to the world . ( they didn ’ t just suck ; they swallowed , too !) <PARA> when the concepts of teenage sex and oral sex began to lose their power to titillate and shock , the target of the legend changed to the new symbols of debauchery and excess : rock stars . in that incarnation the disapproved element of homosexuality was added , as the tale began to be told only about male rock stars , specifically those rumored to be something less than 100 % heterosexual — primarily elton john and rod stewart — but with all the same details ( the collapse , the trip to the emergency room , the pumping of copious amount of seminal fluid from the stomach ) intact : <PARA> never mind that the amount of semen supposedly pumped out of the subject generally exceeded the capacity of even the largest of stomachs , would have required continuously performing blow jobs for about three days straight to ingest , that semen [ in any quantity ] isn ’ t toxic , and that someone who ingested too much would at worst feel nauseated for a little while or throw up but wouldn ’ t be subjected to stomach - pumping . plausibility has never been a barrier to the spread of popular urban legends . <PARA> the following people have had this legend attributed to them : rod stewart , elton john , david bowie , marc almond , mick jagger , andy warhol , jeff beck , jon bon jovi , the drummer for bon jovi , the lead singer for new kids on the block , the bay city rollers ( what , all of them ?), alanis morrissette , li ’ l kim , foxy brown , britney spears , and fiona apple . <PARA> the amount of ejaculate retireved from the star ’ s stomach is often specified , such as 7 ounces , 1 gallon , 10 gallons . <PARA> in his 2012 autobiography , singer rod stewart attributed the connection of his name with this legend to rumors spread by a disgruntled assistant : <PARA> nowadays this legend keeps resurfacing , attributed to whatever singer ( male or female ) is currently disliked for being too popular or too lightweight or too cute ( frequently teenage singers with legions of fawning adolescent fans , such as the new kids on the block or britney spears ). some versions still attempt to shock ( rather than simply denigrate their targets ) by including elements of bestiality . ( that is , in some tellings the stomach contents are said to have included dog semen , as if sperm typing were a category of test a hospital would routinely perform under the circumstances .) <PARA> although this tale is rarely related as a belief tale these days ( i . e ., the tellers generally realize they ’ re passing on something that ’ s merely a wild story and not an account of an actual occurrence , even if they continue to claim the latter ), similar tales about a girl who inadvertently blurts out an embarrassing question in a biology class and a girl who has an unfortunate mishap with a hot dog are still widely related as true events .	
false	many of the entries in this commonly reproduced list of alternative uses for coca - cola are just simple household tips provided by joey green in his 1995 book polish your furniture with panty hose and on his “ wacky uses for brand name products ” website . however , the list includes a tacked - on coda positing that coke is dangerous to drink due to its acidic content : <PARA> that you can cook and clean with coke is relatively meaningless from a safety standpoint . you can use a wide array of common household substances ( including water ) for the same purposes , but that fact alone doesn ’ t necessarily make those substances dangerous to ingest . <PARA> nearly all carbonated soft drinks contain carbonic acid , which is moderately useful for tasks such as removing stains and dissolving rust deposits ( although plain soda water is much better for some of these purposes than coca - cola or other soft drinks , as it doesn ’ t leave a sticky sugar residue behind ). carbonic acid is relatively weak , however , and people have been drinking carbonated water for many years with no detrimental effects . <PARA> the rest of the claims offered here are specious . coca - cola does contain small amounts of citric acid and phosphoric acid ; however , all the insinuations about the dangers these acids might pose to people who drink coca - cola ignore a simple concept familiar to any first - year chemistry student : concentration . coca - cola contains less citric acid than does orange juice , and the concentration of phosphoric acid in coke is far too small ( a mere 11 to 13 grams per gallon of syrup , or about 0 . 20 to 0 . 30 per cent of the total formula ) to dissolve a steak , a tooth , or a nail overnight . ( much of the item will dissolve eventually , but after a day or two you ’ ll still have most of the tooth , a whole nail , and one very soggy t - bone .) <PARA> by comparison , the gastric acid in your stomach ’ s digestive fluids is much stronger than any of the acids found in coca - cola .	
true	the 1980s produced a number of one - hit wonders in the pop music areana , including the infamous tommy tutone and their 1982 hit song “ 867 - 5309 / jenny .” this san francisco band led by tommy heath and jim keller didn ’ t make much of a mark on the music world , and they likely wouldn ’ t be much remembered now were it not for the furor raised by their use of a particular phone number in their one memorable song , the idea for which came from keller ’ s musician friend , alex call : <PARA> in “ jenny ,” a young man laments not having the courage to dial a number found scribbled on a wall but finds some comfort in the notion that he can someday call this girl and sweep her off her feet . though not explicitly stated in the lyrics , it ’ s strongly implied the name and number were harvested from a bathroom wall , which also implies “ jenny ” is a gal of easy virtue and can be had for the price of a phone call : <PARA> “ jenny ( 867 - 5309 )” caused nothing but grief for telephone customers unlucky enough to have that combination of numbers as their own . its relentless chorus , “ jenny don ’ t change your number — eight six seven five three oh nah - eeh - ah - ine ,” pounded the phone number into the minds of teenagers everywhere , resulting in waves of kids dialing it and asking for jenny . the joke quickly became old for those who had the number and weren ’ t interested in talking to horny teens . <PARA> even decades after the song dropped off the charts , phone customers unfortunate enough to have been assigned an 867 - 5309 number were still getting plenty of crank calls . an article from brown university ’ s newspaper explained what happened when the school added an 867 exchange in the fall of 1999 : <PARA> in 2004 a new jersey disc jockey named spencer potter requested 867 - 5309 as his phone number and got it , then he also got first - hand experience with the maxim of being careful what you wish for : <PARA> the song gave rise to its own lore , which asserted that the “ jenny ” in the song was the lead singer ’ s real - life girlfriend ( or ex - girlfriend ): “ i heard a more elaborate story that the number actually belonged to one of the band member ’ s ex - girlfriends ( named jenny , of course ) and that he wrote the song to get back at her for dumping him . she supposedly got a restraining order taken out against him and won a court order to have the song pulled from the airwaves for a while , etc .” <PARA> other explanations leave off jenny ’ s suing the songwriter but have her becoming angry with him and changing her number ( which , ironically , is the one thing the song begged her not to do ). in another flavor of the tale , the band was sued by a sheriff who had both a daughter named jenny and the notorious 867 - 5309 as his home number . <PARA> whether there was ever a real jenny anywhere with that very phone number is debatable . those who attempt to dial 867 - 5309 on a touch - tone phone will quickly discover that this seemingly random combination of seven digits forms a consistent pattern as tapped out on the keypad . the upward diagonal of “ 8 - 6 ” is followed by “ 7 - 5 - 3 ,” the upward diagonal to the left of it , which in turn is followed by “ 0 - 9 ,” yet another upward diagonal , this one to the right of the original starting sequence . <PARA> an adjunct to this legend is the rumor that due to the overwhelming number of prank calls now made to 867 - 5309 , that phone number is permanently non - assigned for every area code in north america . that isn ’ t the case : although 867 - 5309 is unassigned in many area codes , it is a valid working number in some of them ( and such numbers have occasionally been put up for auction on ebay ). in late 2004 a member of our site ’ s message board called 867 - 5309 in every existing area code and found that about twenty of them were still in service . <PARA> sightings : the song “ 867 - 5309 / jenny ” served as the centerpiece for a 2003 cingular television ad touting number portability : <PARA> on 3 july 2014 joe maddon , manager of the tampa bay rays , set his team ’ s batting lineup using position numbers 8 - 6 - 7 - 5 - 3 - 0 - 9 ( with zero standing for the unnumbered designated hitter ).	
false	as santa claus and his reindeer are to the secular celebration of christmas , so the three wise men and the creche are to the religious celebration . even most of the non - religious ( or non - christian ) among us recognize the symbolism of the nativity scene : it depicts the biblical account of three wise men from the east who rode atop camels and followed a star to bethlehem , bearing gifts for the newborn christ child who lay in a manger . <PARA> the truth is , the bible contains virtually none of these details . they have all been added over the years from sources outside the bible . <PARA> mathew 2 : 1 tells us : <PARA> that ’ s it . matthew doesn ’ t say how many wise men came from the east , doesn ’ t mention their names , and doesn ’ t provide any details about how they made their journey . <PARA> it has generally been assumed that the wise men ( or magi ) were three in number because matthew 2 : 11 makes mention of three gifts : “. . . they presented unto him gifts ; gold , and frankincense and myrrh .” the number of wise men is not specified in the bible , however , and some eastern religions have claimed up to twelve of them made the journey to bethlehem . the names of the wise men , gaspar , melchior , and balthasar , do not come from the bible and did not appear in christian literature until over five hundred years after the birth of jesus . nothing in the bible says the wise men rode camels ( or any other animal ); they may have made their journey from the east on foot for all we know . and despite the familiar lyrics of the christmas carol “ we three kings ,” no biblical source depicts the three wise men as kings . ( they were most likely learned men , perhaps astrologers .) <PARA> however many wise men there were , and however they got to bethlehem , the bible tells us they arrived just after the birth and found the baby jesus in a manger , right ? <PARA> not quite . matthew 2 : 11 states : <PARA> the wise men came “ into the house ,” not the stable , and they saw a “ young child ,” not a newborn . this passage indicates that the wise men didn ’ t arrive until quite some time after jesus ’ birth . ( according to luke 2 , it was shepherds , not wise men , who visited the infant jesus in the manger .) <PARA> to sum up : we know from the bible that wise men came from the east , that they followed a star to bethlehem to find the christ child , and that they brought him gold , and frankincense and myrrh . we must look to sources external to the bible to find the origins of any of the other familiar details , however .	
unproven	an anecdote ( of unknown origin ) about an orphaned girl who sees a picture of jesus in sunday school and identifies him as the man who comforted her the night her father killed her mother and himself is a fairly typical example of glurge : <PARA> the particular example would ordinarily be unremarkable save for one facet : in 2000 it was turned into a smash hit by nashville songwriter harley allen and country singer john michael montgomery : <PARA> the song , titled “ the little girl ,” was penned by allen after his brother forwarded him the above - quoted text via e - mail . “ it moved me more than i ’ d been moved in years by a story ,” allen said . “ i grabbed the guitar and just started writing . it didn ’ t take any time at all , about 10 to 15 minutes .” <PARA> according to usa today , “ allen says he and his brother have tried to track the tale ’ s source , without any luck . it ’ s posted on dozens of web sites — usually with a title such as ‘ held by jesus ’ or ‘ and the little child shall lead them ’ — with no attribution . ‘ we don ’ t have a clue ” about its origin , allen says , “ but if it ain ’ t true , it ought to be .'” <PARA> folklore is replete with tales of children who can see — and are saved by — helpful spirits , jesus , or god , who guide and protect innocents from the deprivations of evil adults . the predatory adults in such stories are typically presented as non - religious or specifically non - christian , while the young victims are characterized as being blamelessly non - religious because they are too young and unknowing to have yet made the conscious choice to accept god and jesus . <PARA> a strange coincidence related to this song was that another country singer , allison moorer , released a new album ( the hardest part ) the same day as john michael montgomery came out with his album ( brand new me ) on which “ the little girl ” appeared . moorer ’ s release also included a song (“ cold , cold earth ,” the final , hidden track ) about a father who shot his wife and then turned the gun on himself , only in moorer ’ s case the story was all too true — the man and wife were her parents :	
false	one of the more bizarre celebrity legends is the claim that notorious bank robber john dillinger was not only the proud possessor of an unusually large penis , but that this portion of his anatomy was removed post - mortem and put on display at one of the smithsonian museums in washington , d . c . ( some versions state that the receiving institution was not the smithsonian but the armed forces medical museum , which is on the grounds of the walter reed medical center in washington .) that the smithsonian denies having ( or ever having had ) this piece of classic americana in their collection is part of the game , of course . ( an auxiliary portion of the legend is that smithsonian docents , upon being asked where mr . dillinger ’ s organ can be found , will not deny its presence in the collection but will fabricate an excuse as to why it is not currently on display .) <PARA> how and when this rumor got started is unknown . no documentary evidence indicates that dillinger was renowned for either his sexual prowess or his possession of a prodigious member during his lifetime . it is often claimed that the photograph below , taken in the circus - like atmosphere of the cook county morgue after the elusive bank robber was finally gunned down by fbi agents outside the biograph theater in chicago on 22 july 1934 , begat the legend of the pickled penis : <PARA> the bulge in the center of the photo ( dillinger ’ s arm ) was supposedly mistaken by contemporary viewers of fuzzy newspaper photos for his penis , thus starting the tale of an incredibly well - endowed john dillinger . ( how he managed to die in a fully erect state was a question the public either didn ’ t ponder or else attributed to some rather strange misunderstandings about the process of rigor mortis .) we doubt this explanation of the rumor ’ s genesis because the legend does not seem to have begun circulating until many years after the photograph was first published in newspapers , and it doesn ’ t account for how the famous phallus supposedly came to be housed in one of america ’ s premier museums ( other than that , because it was an extraordinary anatomical specimen , somebody who felt that it belonged in a museum somewhere happily donated it ). how the organ was surreptitiously severed also remains unexplained ; presumably the undertaker who prepared the body for burial in indiana would have noticed the mutilation and reported it to one of dillinger ’ s relatives before the funeral . <PARA> our psychological take on the rumor ? consider that dillinger was the fbi ’ s public enemy # 1 after committing a string of flamboyant bank robberies , continually eluding capture , and boasting that no jail could hold him ( and proving the latter by escaping from the lake county jail in crown point , indiana , on 3 march 1934 , reportedly bluffing his way out with a wooden replica of a gun ). after dillinger held up a few more banks and raided a warsaw , indiana , police station in the following months , the fbi was finally tipped off to his presence at the little bohemia lodge in northern wisconsin . the raid on the lodge by j . edgar hoover ’ s vaunted fbi was an embarrassing disaster : agents opened fired on a carful of innocent lodge visitors ( killing one ), an agent was shot to death by baby face nelson ( who then escaped in an fbi automobile ), and dillinger himself once again eluded capture . <PARA> although the fbi finally caught up with and killed the infamous gangster in chicago a few months later ( with the assistance of anna sage , the “ lady in red ” who tipped off local police to dillinger ’ s presence and agreed to lead him into a trap ), he had given hoover and the fbi a black eye , leading them on a extended merry chase across the midwest and humiliating them by escaping yet again when they had him cornered . what better revenge for hoover than a symbolic emasculation , especially considering that it was a woman whom the fbi finally used to lure dillinger to his death ? spread the word that public enemy # 1 had been interred sans penis , and that his manhood had been put on display for all to see right across town from fbi headquarters in washington , d . c . it ’ s an unlikely explanation , but a satisfying one . <PARA> sightings : look for kevin and his buddies to refer to this legend in an episode of television ’ s the wonder years (“ heartbreak ”, original air date 23 january 1991 ). also , in the 2003 film the recruit , one character offers his romantic interest a day of tourist activities in washington , suggesting they “ look at john dillinger ’ s penis ; i swear to god it ’ s in the smithsonian .” <PARA> in the 1988 jay mcinerney ’ s novel story of my life , we found this : “ i remember i read somewhere that outlaw guy john dillinger had one that was about a foot and a half long and it ’ s preserved in the smithsonian or someplace . now that ’ s what i call the washington monument .”	
false	this quip occurs during a scene in which aladdin , in the guise of prince ali , flies up to jasmine ’ s balcony on his magic carpet to convince her that he is not just another self - absorbed , empty - headed prince . when aladdin steps onto the balcony , jasmine ’ s tiger rajah threatens him and backs him up against the railing . as rajah growls , aladdin tries to shoo him away with his turban and then purportedly whispers , “ good teenagers , take off your clothes .” <PARA> one disney representative claimed that the script called for aladdin to say , “ c ’ mon ... good kitty . take off and go ,” while the closed captioning had him uttering , “ good kitty . take off .” however , neither one of these phrases seemed to match what is heard on the soundtrack . a close listening to the audio track revealed aladdin speaking the words “ c ’ mon ... good kitty ,” and just as aladdin said the word “ kitty ,” a second voice began to whisper , “ pssst ... take off your clo - ...”. who this second voice was , and exactly what he said , is a mystery . <PARA> the moment can be heard in this slow motion audio track , or this one at normal speed , or this third track . decide for yourself : is it a naughty message or just innocent confusion ? <PARA> lisa bannon penned a 1995 story in the associated press about the rumor , with one mother calling the line of dialogue “ a toddler introduction to porn ”: <PARA> there is no other character in the scene who could conceivably be speaking : the tiger doesn ’ t talk , the voice is male ( eliminating jasmine ), and both the genie and the rug are below the balcony and off - screen . perhaps the overlapping voices were merely the product of bad editing , and some stray bit of chatter ( or a piece of dialog that was supposed to have been clipped ) was accidentally grafted onto the soundtrack . whatever was being said , to the casual listener the resulting phrase can certainly sound like , “ good teenagers , take off your clothes ,” although the phrase is clearly the combination of two different voices speaking in two different tones . once people have been told what they ’ re “ supposed ” to be hearing , however , they find it difficult to maintain objectivity and therefore swear that aladdin couldn ’ t possibly be saying anything else . <PARA> the “ take off your clothes ” rumor started soon after aladdin was released on home video in 1993 . a garbled and whispered portion of dialogue that could barely be heard in the theater was being replayed over and over in millions of homes , but was difficult to distinguish . someone came up with a salacious phrase that sounded somewhat like the original portions of dialogue , and the power of suggestion took over . people began to hear what they were being told they should hear , much like beatles fans eagerly sharing backwards - masked paul is dead aural clues . <PARA> the aladdin rumor spread by word of mouth during 1994 and was eventually printed in movie guide magazine , an atlanta - based christian entertainment review . due in part to that article , the controversial phrase was brought to the attention of the american life league , a religious organization that had been boycotting disney films since the previous april as a protest over the movie priest . the american life league gave new prominence to the rumor in september 1995 , when it claimed the phrase was yet another piece of evidence that disney had been sneaking “ sexual messages ” into their animated films ( the little mermaid being the most notorious example ) for the past several years .	
false	after scanning this little piece of junior high school scatology , we truly hope we will “ read [ only ] one disgusting story this year .” unfortunately , it ’ s only january , so our chances of success are dim . <PARA> what else can one say but someone had too much time on his hands ? the silly little gem quoted above appeared on the internet in january 2000 . it combines the bestial impregnation motif of the “ woman impregnated with octopus eggs ” with the “ animal used as masturbatory toy ” motif of the gerbil tale . the kinky masturbation theme from the “ girl and the hot dog ” tale gets worked into the mix , too . as usual , we have a detail indicating homosexuality — “ the medics found a lesbian xxx video in the vcr ” — because we all know from similar tales that no woman ever masturbates unless she can ’ t ( or won ’ t ) find a real man to pleasure her . ( this same notion is found in the legend about the woman , her dog , and some peanut butter .) <PARA> considering the deviance of the fictional woman ’ s crime , it ’ s no wonder the author of the piece has her die . considering his writing skills , we think it ’ s a shame he didn ’ t pen a similar ending for himself . <PARA> the “ writer ” at least managed to include a few details in his piece ( i . e ., the woman ’ s name and home town ), but that ’ s about all he got right in terms of credibility . the narrative has a few glaring plotting errors : <PARA> as well , brine shrimp take a day to hatch , not two . they also won ’ t hatch out in anything less than extremely salty water , a substance not found in a woman ’ s vagina . it also takes more than salty water and eggs to bring about hatching — exposure to light within the first few hours of incubation is key . brine shrimp growers recommend the eggs be exposed to a light source throughout incubation . constant aeration ( bubbling ) is also necessary to provide sufficient oxygen levels for the eggs to hatch , this is also not a condition found in a woman ’ s vagina . <PARA> see brine shrimp direct ' s faq : hatching for more than you likely would ever want to know about raising brine shrimp .	
unproven	civilized society stands divided into two distinct camps : those who adore fruitcake , and those who detest it . on the fruitcake issue , the middle ground stretches out forlornly deserted , across which each side glares at the other . <PARA> on only one issue do the two sides agree : they ’ re both charmed by the ultimate fruitcake recipe . <PARA> those readers whose first exposure to the ultimate fruitcake recipe occurred on the internet might well think the bit of humor quoted above originated in this medium . truth is , versions of it have been kicking around for years , as this example from 1959 shows : <PARA> all kidding about drunken cooks aside , fruitcake has been a part of festive celebrations for a very long time . it ’ s been popular in europe since roman times , when cooks mixed raisins , pine nuts and pomegranate seeds into barley mash . in the middle ages , honey , dried fruits and spices were added to bread dough for special occasions . at one time , fruitcake was considered semi - sacred , with laws in place in europe until the end of the 18th century that restricted its making to celebrations such as christmas , easter , weddings , and the like . <PARA> it ’ s impossible to age a fruitcake too long , say those in the know . if stored in an airtight container and basted occasionally with liquor , it ’ ll keep indefinitely . <PARA> then again , the same could have been said of admiral nelson .	
false	the following tale sends chills down your spine , doesn ’ t it ? <PARA> ah , but it ’ s only a ghost story : no mummy ( cursed or otherwise ) was carried as cargo by the ill - fated rms titanic on its one and only voyage . <PARA> first of all , the tale is logically inconsistent . one of the few names quoted in the piece is that of helena blavatsky , a well - known occultist of the period . and we ’ re told the dreaded princess of amen - ra was purchased in luxor , egypt , by four foolish young englishmen “ in the late 1890s ,” while later in the same piece we ’ re informed of helena blavatsky ’ s dire pronouncements to the private collector who supposedly had possession of the mummy right before it was shipped on the titanic . these claims cannot both be true , because helena blavatsky died of influenza in 1891 , but the titanic ‘ s first and only voyage didn ’ t take place until 1912 . <PARA> as for the facts of the matter , in 1985 , charles haas , president of the national titanic historical society , gained access to the ship ’ s cargo manifest and cargo diagrams . though the cargo included raw feathers , linen , straw , hatter ’ s fur , tissue , auto parts , leather , rabbit hair , elastics , hair nets and refrigerating apparatus , not so much as one mummy was listed . <PARA> speaking to the legend that a cursed mummy was on board , haas said , “ the cargo manifest throws those myths right out the window .” other experts have come to the same conclusion : no mummy — least of all one “ of the vengeful princess of amen - ra ” — was shipped aboard the titanic . ( of course , the fact that the ship ’ s manifest listed no gold and no insurance claims were filed for valuable gems hasn ’ t stopped people from believing that those objects went down with the titanic as well .) note that “ amen - ra ” isn ’ t the name of a place ; it ’ s the name of an egyptian god , one whose name means “ the hidden one ”. he was seen as the creator of all things and , with his consort mut and their son the moon - god khonshu , was worshipped in the great temples of luxor and karnak . <PARA> in fact , the mummy to which this story refers ( which was actually just the coffin lid , not the mummy , of the priestess of amun ) never left the british museum , and it is still there to this day . so how did this fanciful tale begin ? <PARA> this ghost story was concocted around the turn of the century by two englishmen named william stead and douglas murray . stead was a well - known journalist and editor who crusaded on behalf of liberal causes and created a national scandal when he published an article entitled “ the maiden tribute of modern babylon ,” describing how he was able to purchase the services of a thirteen - year - old prostitute for £ 5 . stead was also a believer in mysticism and spiritualism who consulted mediums , investigated psychic phenomena , and published a related periodical . we don ’ t know much about murray — he ’ s been described as an “ egyptologist ” and as the man who shipped the mummy in question to london in the first place , although he was probably neither . <PARA> stead and murray crafted an elaborate horror story about a mummy that was brought to england and set up in the drawing room of an acquaintance of theirs . the morning after the mummy arrived , they claimed , everything breakable in the room was destroyed . the mummy was moved from room to room within the house , but each move resulted in the same destruction of all the breakable objects at hand . <PARA> wherever the mummy went , it brought sickness , death and destruction to its owner . sometime after stead and murray invented their mummy tale , they were visiting the first egyptian room of the british museum and noticed the coffin lid of the priestess of amun . they concocted yet another story that the look of terror and anguish in the face depicted on the coffin lid indicated that the coffin ’ s original occupant was a tormented soul , and her evil spirit was now loose in the world . stead and murray told their fanciful tale to eager newspaper reporters who — then as now — weren ’ t about to let the truth get in the way of a sensationally good story . the two stories were conflated into one and spread widely , and the priestess of amun came to be identified as the mummy whose mortal remains wreaked havoc wherever they were stored . <PARA> this ghost story made the leap from london to the titanic after william stead went down with the ill - fated ship on 15 april 1912 . stead was traveling to america at president taft ’ s request to address a peace conference , and he took delight in relating his “ cursed mummy ” tale to titanic passengers . he reportedly defied superstition by starting his narrative at a dinner party on friday , the 12th of april , and drew it out so that he concluded the tale just after midnight on the 13th . <PARA> a few days after the titanic ‘ s sinking , one of the survivors recounted stead ’ s “ cursed mummy ” tale in an interview with the new york world , and eventually the ghost story stead and murray invented , stead ’ s presence aboard the titanic , and reports of stead ’ s having related the mummy tale to titanic passengers became jumbled together , producing a new legend about an actual mummy aboard the titanic . <PARA> the modified legend told of a cursed mummy the british museum was so anxious to be rid of that they sold it to an american , who naturally sought to ship it back home via the titanic . the presence of the cursed mummy ( which had escalated the expressions of its wrath from breaking cups and saucers and making people ill to sinking passenger liners ) in the titanic ‘ s hold came to be whispered as the cause of the most famous maritime disaster in history . in an even more elaborate version of the legend , the mummy ’ s american owner paid a bribe to have the mummy placed in one of the titanic ‘ s lifeboats ; it was then smuggled aboard the carpathia when that ship picked up the titanic ‘ s survivors and secretly landed in new york . <PARA> when the mummy continued to wreak havoc at its new home , its new owner had it taken to canada in preparation for shipping it back to england . the mummy was placed aboard the liner empress of ireland , which , while on its way from quebec city to liverpool on 29 may 1914 , was struck by a norwegian coal ship . the empress of ireland sank so quickly that only 7 of her 40 lifeboats could be launched , and 840 passengers went down with her . <PARA> as to how widespread this “ curse of the mummy ” stuff is , some of the crew members on a failed 1980 expedition to locate the sunken titanic spoke darkly of the famous mummy that was allegedly on board her , saying it transferred the curse of all who disturbed its grave to the vessel ’ s maiden voyage and all subsequent search efforts . ( yeah . like it couldn ’ t have been plain bad luck . and what was the mummy doing back on the titanic after having sailed on the empress of ireland ?) <PARA> in looking to blame their bad luck on an outside force they couldn ’ t possibly have hoped to defeat , those crew members weren ’ t all that unusual . they merely brought into play a standard avoidance technique employed to keep us from having to confront what a scary , random world this place can be . in the wake of any disaster , there ’ s a strong urge to explain away the tragedy by ascribing it to some dark power beyond our control . as inconceivable as this might seem at first blush , it ’ s easier for many people to accept that a cursed mummy was the cause of great loss of life than it is to co - exist with the knowledge that sometimes even unthinkable accidents will happen . being at the mercy of the god of random chance is far more frightening a reality to face than any vengeful mummy will ever be . <PARA> ghost stories like this one reaffirm our faith in the world being a predictable ( and therefore safe ) place . if a great tragedy such as the sinking of the titanic can be explained away as the direct result of the evil forces of the supernatural ’ s being stirred up , we can again feel safe about placing our faith in the inherent safety of great ships , airplanes or even automobiles . <PARA> beyond the reassurance factor , such tales also make darned good storytelling . that too lies at the heart of their appeal . <PARA> in case you ’ re curious ( and have some vacation time to spare ), the coffin lid of the priestess of amun is still on display at the british museum , just as it was when stead and murray created their infamous “ cursed mummy ” tale a century ago . look for exhibit bm no . 22542 , in the second egyptian room .	
true	our grisly tale begins with this newspaper clipping from december 1993 : <PARA> you might think that so gruesome a tale couldn ’ t get worse , but you ’ d be wrong . <PARA> in december of 1993 , gregory glover paid the ultimate penalty for messing with another fellow ’ s wife . his friend , stephen schap , didn ’ t take the news of glover ’ s wrongdoings all that gracefully , coming as it was from his pregnant wife ’ s lips with her about to give birth to this other man ’ s child . <PARA> leading up to this gruesome event was the breakdown of the schaps ’ marriage . posted to a u . s . army airfield in germany , sgt . schap and his wife grew apart over time , a condition schap was seemingly unaware of , but one with which his wife was all too painfully in touch . communication broke down , loneliness set in , and a friendship with one of her husband ’ s army buddies progressed from the platonic to the physical . <PARA> diane schap asked for a divorce at various times , citing marital breakdown as her reason , but her husband always managed to talk her into trying again . he was unaware ( or perhaps uncaring ) of the depth of her dissatisfaction and completely in the dark about her involvement with another man . as well , there was the coming child to consider , a child schap did not know was not his . <PARA> and so the stage was set in early december of 1993 . schap discovered indications of his wife ’ s infidelity from reading her diary while she was away for a weekend visiting a girlfriend . though she ’ d previously asked for a divorce , she ’ d never mentioned her relationship with glover . the news in her diary came as a shock to schap ; upon her return he asked her pointblank if she ’ d been sleeping with his friend . she assured him she had not been , and this assurance appeared to satisfy her husband . he contacted the base chaplain the next day to make arrangements for diane to return to the states ; the two of them had finally reached agreement on a divorce . <PARA> diane was hospitalized on december 7 for complications relating to her pregnancy . it was then that she decided that her husband must be told about the parentage of the child she was carrying . she shared her news with him from her hospital bed , and he initially appeared to take it well . ( since schap had already resigned himself to the marriage ’ s being over , perhaps this wasn ’ t all that unexpected a response .) within the hour he returned in an agitated state , demanding to know details of who her lover was and where they ’ d made love . <PARA> after this confrontation , schap left “ to pack his things .” in reality he went to seek out glover . schap found him in a phone booth on the base , in the process of conversing with diane . the lovers had been speaking for 5 or 10 minutes , diane testified , when glover suddenly swore twice . the second expletive was “ cut off mid - breath ,” she said . “ then all i heard was the dial tone .” <PARA> glover suffered slight knife wounds in the telephone booth , then tried to escape on foot . he ran a short distance but slipped and fell , and schap was quickly on top of him , according to witnesses . schap stabbed his victim 10 to 15 times before beheading him . <PARA> we quote diane schap ’ s recollection of the events from her description of them at schap ’ s trial : <PARA> stephan schap was courtmartialed for the murder of gregory glover in april 1994 . he was found guilty and given a mandatory life sentence .	
mixture	the unmistakable curved shape of its bottle has been part of coca - cola ’ s image since the original glass contour bottle was introduced throughout the united states in 1916 . to this day people wonder where the design came from , and some odd theories about its origins have surfaced over the years , including one about its being modeled after a victorian hooped dress . <PARA> ( one popular misconception credits the bottle ’ s unique form to famed industrial designer raymond loewy . that one is easily dismissed as loewy didn ’ t arrive in america until 1919 , three years after what came to be called the “ hobble skirt ” bottle was in wide distribution . loewy later designed products for coca - cola such as cans , coolers , and vending machines , which likely led to this misconception . he also called the coke bottle “ the most perfectly designed package in the world ,” and it ’ s unlikely he ’ d have been that arrogant if he were describing his own design .) <PARA> none of the false theories is any more odd than what the coca - cola company itself claims as the correct origin , however . <PARA> back in 1915 , soda bottles were pretty much the same shape no matter which beverage they contained . what differentiated one unopened soda from another was its label . that was a workable system , except for one problem : paper labels slid off when the bottles they were affixed to became wet . <PARA> in those long - ago days , keeping soft drinks chilled was typically accomplished by leaving them in tubs of ice water . this led to confusion and frustration as customers blindly fished around in cold water for the brands they wanted . finally , a light bulb went off over someone ’ s head : what if coca - cola ’ s bottle had an unusual shape ? the days of brand confusion would be over , because a customer could easily pick out an ice - cold coke by feel alone . <PARA> so much for the decision to shape the bottle differently ; now on to where this particular shape came from . though i grant this is a hard one to swallow , coca - cola swears it happened like this : <PARA> a heat wave shut down operations at the root glass company of terre haute , indiana , one of coca - cola ’ s bottle suppliers . as a result , there was free time to be frittered away on odd projects . plant manager alex samuelson was puzzling over the coke bottle design problem when he was struck by an inspiration . what if the bottle were made to resemble the shape of either a kola nut or a coca leaf , the two ingredients the flagship product had been named for ? <PARA> he dispatched one of his employees ( a fellow by the name of clyde edwards ) off to the city library to look up information about those two items . a misunderstanding occurred , leading edwards to the wrong page of the encyclopedia britannica . the sketches he returned with were turned into the bottle design we know and love so much today , but the vertical striations and curved , bulging middle bore no resemblance whatsoever to either the coca leaf or the kola nut . instead , they were a darned good rendition of a cacao tree seed pod . yes , cacao . as in chocolate . <PARA> while this story has been related in books , and with my own ears i ’ ve heard it told as gospel at both the coca - cola museum in las vegas and its parent museum in atlanta , it ’ s not the actual truth . instead , the preceding account is a highly colored version of what actually occurred . ( mystique overshadows truth in other coca - cola origin tales , such as the company ’ s claim that the beverage was carbonated by accident .) <PARA> instead , acutely aware of the need for a better container for its product , in 1915 coca - cola sponsored a design competition among its bottle suppliers . the contest listed only two requirements : the bottle had to be distinctive and had to fit existing equipment . while the root glass company of terre haute ’ s plant manager alex samuelson and plant employee <PARA> clyde edwards were tangentially involved in the process that led to the design of what became the quintessential coca - cola bottle , the actual designer and the man who ultimately turned his own artistic concept into the prototype bottle was earl r . dean , the supervisor of the bottle molding room at that facility . moreover , there was no “ happy accident ” of mistaking one page of the encyclopedia for another . dean , inspired by samuelson ’ s query about what made up coca - cola , posited that there might be a bottle design idea to be found in the look of either the coca plant or the kola nut ( the two ingredients coca - cola is named for ), and set out for the local library to unearth information about those two ingredients with clyde edwards in tow . ( as the auditor at root glass , edwards knew his way around the library and therefore was thought likely to be able to assist dean in his search .) <PARA> there was no information to be found about either the coca leaf or the kola nut at the local library , which scotched that plan . however , a picture of a cacao pod in the encyclopedia britannica gave dean a further jolt of inspiration : he realized that the striations on that rather odd - looking gourd - like thing might serve as the jumping - off point for a workable bottle design . he sketched a copy of the drawing , took it back to the plant , worked up a bottle design based upon it , presented it to c . j . root ( the plant ’ s owner ), gained his approval , created a mold for the prototype bottle , and produced one . that bottle became the widely - recognized symbol of coca - cola . <PARA> in the actual story of the bottle , there are no fortuitous accidents that work to impel fate ( i . e ., no heat wave that shuts down plant operations , leaving folks with idle time in which to dream up a better bottle ), and no dumb mistakes that turn out well ( i . e ., no dunderheaded confusion of one page of the encyclopedia for another ). the tale is instead one of a design concept that didn ’ t quite pan out ( dearth of information about the coca leaf or the kola nut , causing the idea of basing the bottle on either of them to be scrapped ), leaving the would - be designer hunting for something else that might work , and in the process happening upon the look of the cacao pod .	
false	it ’ s the classic cautionary tale about the pitfalls of doing business in foreign countries that can be found in hundreds ( if not thousands ) of books about marketing : general motors introduced their chevrolet nova model of automobile into a spanish - speaking market , then scratched their heads in puzzlement when it sold poorly . gm executives were baffled until someone finally pointed out to them that “ nova ” translates as “ doesn ’ t go ” in spanish . the embarrassed automobile giant changed the model name to the caribe , and sales of the car took off . <PARA> this anecdote is frequently used to illustrate the perils of failing to do adequate preparation and research before introducing a product into the international marketplace . it ’ s a wicked irony , then , that the people who use this example are engaging in the very thing they ’ re decrying , because a little preparation and research would have informed them that it isn ’ t true . ( the sources that repeat this little tale can ’ t even agree on where the nova supposedly sold poorly , variously listing locales such as puerto rico , mexico , south america , or simply “ spanish - speaking countries .”) this is another one of those tales that makes its point so well — just like the fable about george washington and the cherry tree — that nobody wants to ruin it with a bunch of facts . nonetheless , we ’ re here to ruin it . <PARA> the original chevrolet nova ( initially the chevy ii ) hit the u . s . market in 1962 . ( this car should not be confused with the smaller , front wheel drive vehicle which was produced in 1985 as a joint venture between general motors and toyota and also assigned the nova name .) between 1972 and 1978 the chevrolet nova was also sold in mexico and several other spanish - speaking countries , primarily venezuela . shortly afterwards the great “ nova ” legend arose , a legend which a little linguistic analysis shows it to be improbable : <PARA> the truth is that the chevrolet nova ’ s name didn ’ t significantly affect its sales : it sold well in both its primary spanish - language markets , mexico and venezuela , and its venezuelan sales figures actually surpassed gm ’ s expectations . <PARA> the whole “ nova = “ doesn ’ t go ” tale was merely another in a long line of automotive jokes , like the ones about “ ford ” being an acronym for “ fix or repair daily ” or “ found on road dead ” or “ fiat ” being an acronym for “ fix it again , tony !” these humorous inventions might adequately reflect the tellers ’ feelings about the worthiness of various types of automobiles , but we don ’ t really expect that anyone ever refrained from buying a ford because he actually believed they needed to be repaired on a daily basis . <PARA> the one bit of supporting evidence offered to back up this legend is spurious as well . general motors , we ’ re told , finally wised up and changed the model name of their automobile from nova to caribe , after which sales of the car “ took off .” the problem with this claim is that the caribe sold in mexico was manufactured by volkswagen , not by general motors . ( the caribe was the model name used by vw in mexico for the car more commonly known in the usa as the volkswagen golf .) the nova ’ s model name was never changed for the spanish - speaking market . <PARA> the chevy nova legend lives on in countless marketing textbooks , is repeated in numerous business seminars , and is a staple of newspaper and magazine columnists who need a pithy example of human folly . perhaps someday this apocryphal tale will become what it should be : an illustration of how easily even “ experts ” can sometimes fall victim to the very same dangers they warn us about .	
unproven	this legend dates to at least the early 1970s . the horrific accident that created the protective ghosts is said to have involved an oncoming train and a schoolbus stalled on the tracks . according to widely believed lore , spirits of the slain youngsters forever after haunted that location , shoving stalled cars out of harm ’ s way , lest more innocents share their fate . tiny handprints on the back of the saved vehicles are a motif common to this legend and serve to explain why the stalled vehicles are magically moved . another version has some form of tame demon assisting the dead kids in their crusade . ( hoofprints , since you asked .) <PARA> although the city of san antonio has long claimed this folk tale as its own , pointing to the railway crossing where villamain road becomes shane road where cars seem to behave strangely and close to a set of streets named after children ( bobbie allen , cindy sue , laura lee , nancy carole , and richey otis ), the bus accident that sparked the legend took place in a city more than a thousand miles away . <PARA> in december 1938 , in salt lake city , utah , twenty - six children , aged 12 to 18 , lost their lives when the school bus they ’ d been travelling in stalled on the tracks and was struck by a freight train . no similar accident took place in san antonio , but in 1938 that city was subjected to about ten days ’ worth of gruesomely detailed coverage in its local newspaper of the salt lake city crash , memory of which afterwards served to convince later generations the tragedy had taken place locally . <PARA> san antonio ’ s “ ghost tracks ” are nothing more than an optical illusion . the mysterious movement of vehicles at that crossing is the result of a slight incline at the site , which works to roll vehicles that have been slipped into neutral off the tracks . as for the nearby streets supposedly christened in memoriam to the children who died , they were actually named in honor of a developer ’ s grandchildren . <PARA> the “ ghosts of schoolkids push vehicle off tracks ” group of tales is a subset of a larger group of stories , gravity hill tales . many gravity hill factlets are offered as a “ gee whiz ” kind of thing with no storyline to them , just that if a car is slipped into neutral at the right place , it ’ ll move as if by magic . <PARA> a further subset of gravity hill lore involves legends about dead teens . though we also have cars stalled on train tracks and the onrushing train killing the occupants ( thus creating the helpful ghosts ), others involve freeway exit ramps where it is rumored cars stopped on them will roll back uphill . the explanation offered has it that either a carload of teens heading for no particular destination or a girl on her way to the prom die in a horrible accident on that off ramp when their car stalls and is hit from behind or the brakes go and the vehicle is sent flying into the middle of the intersection at the end of the ramp where it collides with a tractor trailer . the mysterious movement of later cars is explained as the ghost ( s ) of the dead teen ( s ) attempting to push stalled vehicles out of harm ’ s way . ( for a sighting of this version of the legend , visit the franklin lakes gravity road page .) <PARA> unlike the kids on the schoolbus tales , handprints are rarely found on these rescued cars . the explanation motif ( why did my car just do that ?) used in this set of legends is much like that employed in the vanishing hitchhiker — something weird happens , the person it happened to remarks upon it in front of locals , prompting one of them to volunteer the story about the long - ago accident and the dead teen ghosts . <PARA> variations :
