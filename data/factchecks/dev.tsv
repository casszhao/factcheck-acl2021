unproven	in late november 2017 , a meme circulated on facebook with the claim that the amish community , a relatively small and isolated group of christians who live throughout the american northeast and midwest and abide by the lifestyle and technology of a bygone era , own 20 percent of the nation ’ s “ puppy mills ,” a term used by animal advocates to refer to commercial dog breeding kennels : <PARA> it cannot be said with certainty what percentage of the nation ’ s dog breeding for profit is done by members of the amish community , because while some breeders are licensed and tracked by both their respective states and the federal government , many operate unregulated or illegally . according to the humane society of the united states , there are an estimated 10 , 000 licensed and unlicensed “ puppy mills ” in the nation . <PARA> in pennsylvania and ohio , which have the highest amish populations , the vast majority of known commercial breeding kennels are in lancaster and holmes counties respectively ; both counties have the nation ’ s oldest and largest amish population concentrations . according to pennsylvania state records , there are 119 known commercial breeding kennels in lancaster — although many are listed as closing , or have already closed . in ohio , 134 of the state ’ s total 268 breeding facilities are in holmes county . the states do not track the religious views of the breeders . <PARA> amish people make up a small percentage of americans , with an estimated population of roughly 300 , 000 . but , according to animal welfare groups , the amish are prolific dog breeders , and in many of those operations , dogs are kept in poor conditions . in may 2017 , the pennsylvania society for prevention of cruelty to animals rescued 27 dogs from an illegal breeder in lancaster county , spca spokeswoman gillian kocher told us . at least two , a yellow labrador retriever and a bulldog , were in desperate need of immediate veterinary care . all the dogs were rehabilitated and adopted into permanent homes , she said , and the spca has pressed charges against the breeder . <PARA> according to the humane society , unlicensed breeders can mean terrible conditions for dogs , including neglect , untreated health problems , and dogs forced to produce litter after litter of puppies . hsus ’ s yearly list of 100 “ horrible ” breeders includes accounts of everything from shivering , wounded dogs to a breeder still in operation even though she shot a dog in the head in 2008 . according to hsus , these breeders continue to operate despite receiving multiple warnings and citations from law enforcement . <PARA> because there are millions of unwanted pets in animal shelters , animal advocates generally encourage prospective pet owners to adopt from shelters and rescues instead of purchasing from breeders ( but in cases where a breeder is preferred , hsus also provides a checklist on how to find a responsible one ). according to the american society for the prevention of cruelty to animals , 3 . 3 million dogs enter shelters every year , and of those , 670 , 000 are euthanized . these numbers have been in decline since 2011 , owing to an increase in the number of pets adopted and lost animals successfully reunited with owners .
false	in march 2016 , a number of news sites published items about a ( nearly too funny to be true ) accident involving a fiat and a wall painted to look like a looney tunes ’ road runner - style fake tunnel : <PARA> mandatory , jalopnik , the atlanta journal - constitution , and atlanta television station wsb were among the news outlets that covered the purported crash , with most reports consisting solely of two to three sentences explaining that the accident was documented by a reddit user with no independent verification of the claim . among those outlets , only jalopnik pointed out that the story was unauthenticated and not very plausible : <PARA> as the writer observed , the short tale consisting mostly of pictures hit all the right notes for social media virality , and no one ( including news outlets ) seemed to care much whether it really happened . the photograph - based narrative included nostalgic references ( looney tunes ), little need for explanation , and the chance to feel superior to the unfortunate individual stupid enough to drive into a painted wall . the element of childhood memories was expressed in memes that circulated around the same time : <PARA> most people of driving age would get the joke , and of course be aware that the included image of road runner suggested an apparent tunnel was not to be trusted . a few posts cited a 17 december 2015 item by the british tabloid mirror , which was a good example of most coverage of the claim : <PARA> as that post noted , the image was submitted on reddit ’ s r / funny on 16 december 2015 , and at the same time , a different user posted it with the same title to imgur . the atlanta - journal constitution described the reddit post in this way in march 2016 : <PARA> however , the reddit user didn ’ t claim to have taken the images , nor did he or she add any information about the purported crash . in fact , that reddit account had been used solely to post images ( mostly of a pornographic nature ) and seemingly shared the picture just to accrue points on the site . despite the virality of the photographs , the user never returned to offer details of alleged incident or claim ownership of the images . the imgur user similarly did claim to have been the source of the pictures and frequently shared images that appeared to come from other sources . at least one web site took a closer look at the images and pointed out that the chain of events suggested was easily proved false , as the various pictures weren ’ t even photographs of the same car — the first car depicted was a fiat uno , and the second a fiat strada : <PARA> although both cars were red fiats , the strada featured a distinctive grill not present on the uno , and the uno ’ s boxy rear was unlike the strada ’ s ( which featured a bed ). also , the three photographs were not clearly connected to one another : in addition to the depiction of different cars , the pictures included no indication that the scene involving the crashed strada occurred anywhere near the painting of the tunnel . <PARA> a december 2015 article ( published in portuguese and translated below ) pinned the original painting to brazil , and contained two of the three images spliced together for the viral story . however , that article explained that painting had been removed in december 2015 to avoid crashes and that no such crash had occurred by the time it was painted over : <PARA> as the excerpt explained , officials in the area of the mural became aware of the internet fabrication and painted over the mural . in the short time the road runner tunnel painting was visible , no crashes occurred . the claim became newly viral in march 2016 , several months after it appeared on reddit , but the story was proved to be false in december 2015 . much like a similar claim about a hairdressing mishap , news outlets primarily sourced the photographs from the internet without examining whether the backstory offered was in any way plausible .

true	origins : this image shown above is difficult to classify : it isn ’ t a photograph that captures how late singer michael jackson ever actually looked , but it is a genuine projection from the mid - 1980s of what his appearance might be like fifteen years in the future . <PARA> in its august 1985 issue , ebony magazine ran a “ portraits of the stars ” feature in which it commissioned an artist to create portraits of how various black <PARA> celebrities might look in the year 2000 ( a date which was then still a good fourteen years in the future ). ebony ‘ s collection of artificially aged notables included muhammad ali , billy dee williams , kim fields , jayne kennedy , magic johnson , emmanuel lewis , debbie allen , kareem abdul - jabbar , and , as the lead - off to the article , michael jackson . jackson , who was 27 years old at the time , was pictured ( as shown above ) as the artist anticipated the popular singer might look in the year 2000 ( when he would have been 41 years old ): “ he will have aged gracefully and will have a handsome , more mature look .” <PARA> of course , by the year 2000 michael jackson didn ’ t look anything like ebony ‘ s artist had anticipated he might back in 1985 , as jackson subsequently underwent cosmetic procedures that altered his appearance :

mixture	at 1 : 30 am on the morning of 23 march 2002 , a 41 - year - old dental surgery student was shot and killed by an off - duty police officer while pulling his car from a parking lot in front of a d . c .- area apartment complex : <PARA> the hundley family brought a civil suit against gaines , another officer , and the district of columbia in three separate areas : first , a tort law claim of assault and battery based on the officer ’ s fatal shot ; second , a violation of the fourth amendment ’ s ban on excessive force ; and third , a tort law claim of negligence based on gaines ’ initial stop of hundley . <PARA> a jury awarded the hundley estate $ 242 , 000 based on the the third claim , ruling that hundley ’ s death was the result of a the officer ’ s negligence in performing this initial traffic stop . both sides were unhappy with the ruling , according to the washington post ‘ s 2004 coverage of the trial : <PARA> on appeal , both the defendants ( officer gaines et al ) and the plaintiffs ( the hundley family ) challenged that ruling , as described in court documents : <PARA> this appeal was heard by the d . c . circuit court of appeals , and the opinion was written by judge brett kavanaugh , who later became president trump ’ s controversial nominee to the supreme court . <PARA> the crux of the appeal argument centered on jury inconsistency . in the original trial , the jury was asked to rule on the three issues brought to the court and , in what is known as an interrogatory jury question , on the reliability or truth of officer gaines ’ version of events : <PARA> both the lawyers representing gaines as well as the lawyers representing the interests of the hundley family pointed to this fact as a reason for appeal , as jury inconsistency is a valid grounds for appeal under in federal law . in the hundley family ’ s case , they argued that “ the jury ’ s written interrogatory response is inconsistent with the jury ’ s findings for defendants on the assault and battery and excessive force claims .” gaines et al , on the other hand , pointed to the finding as a reason to reject the damages awarded to the hundleys by the jury , as their verdict with respect to negligence relied on a narrative the jury themselves said was not truthful . kavanaugh agreed that the jury verdict was inconsistent : <PARA> ultimately , kavanaugh rendered a 180 - degree shift on both sides of this argument . he ruled that because the negligence claim relied on a narrative deemed false by the jury , that that charge and the damages awarded because of it should be overturned . this aspect of the decision has led to the online narrative that “ a jury found that a cop lied [ but ] brett kavanaugh threw out the verdict ”: <PARA> while this meme expresses a factually accurate statement , it tells only a portion of the story . using the same logic that prompted the reversal of the negligence charge , kavanaugh also overturned the earlier rulings that did not hold the officer liable for assault or excessive force , remanding that aspect of the case for a new trial : <PARA> it is uncertain if the hundley family sought a retrial after this ruling or reached a settlement with the defendants . ( an email to the lawyer who represented the hundley ’ s in this matter was not immediately returned .) regardless , kavanaugh ’ s ruling did have the effect of reversing a cash settlement given to the hundley family , but it also allowed for a new trial on first two claims the hundleys had lost during their initial trial .
false	in early 2018 , a number of far - right facebook pages and disinformation sites recirculated variations of an outdated and exaggerated claim about a tennessee school district banning the american flag from campus . <PARA> the specifics of the claim varied from page to page ( some said that students were banned from flying the flag ; others claimed that the flag had been banned from campus because it was offensive to certain students ), but all iterations included an image of the flag and some version of the question : do you agree that we should always be able to fly the flag ? <PARA> three of these four facebook posts claimed that this tennessee school district had “ recently ” banned the american flag from campus . however , these posts are referring ( inaccurately ) to an incident that took place more than two years earlier , in august 2015 , and the tennessee school district referenced never banned the american flag to begin with . <PARA> in 2015 , the dickson county school district temporarily ruled to not allow students to fly flags from their vehicles . at the time , the removal of confederate flags from public grounds was a hot issue in the media . when at least one student in this district came to school with a confederate flag on their truck , the school responded by telling students that they were no longer allowed to fly flags from their vehicles across the board : <PARA> the school district ’ s decision stirred up considerable controversy at the time , as some media outlets reported that the school had banned american flags wholesale . however , as the school district has clarified on numerous occasions , it never banned flags from campuses , and this “ rule ” was an informal one relayed to students in an attempt to inform them about how to properly display the american flag . <PARA> in a long explanation published by the district in the wake of this controversy , officials explained that the american flag could be flown from vehicles if it was properly displayed , since it did not serve as a distraction . furthermore , students would be allowed to bring flags to campus as long as it was done so respectfully : <PARA> this controversy is not just inaccurate , but also outdated .
false	in late 2015 a claim spreading on social media under the heading “ islam was banned from the usa in 1952 ,” holding that muslims has been banned from entering or immigrating to the united states back in the early 1950s : <PARA> the image sharply escalated in popularity following an unprecedented statement from republican presidential candidate donald trump , who on 7 december 2015 ( in the wake of a mass shooting in san bernardino that had occurred five days earlier ) suggested the united states should bar all muslims from entering the country until such time as lawmakers could “ figure out what [ was ] going on ” <PARA> simply put , the rumor maintained that muslims as a group were ineligible for admission to the united states based upon a law that prohibited entry to any alien who “ belongs to an organization seeking to overthrow the government of the united states by ‘ force , violence , or other unconstitutional means .'” <PARA> the law referenced was the immigration and nationality act of 1952 , also known as the mccarran – walter act . its text is available in full at the u . s . citizenship and naturalization services ( uscis ) web site , where a preface indicates that the law has “ been amended many times over the years but is still the basic body of immigration law .” <PARA> the claim typically cited “ chapter 2 section 212 ” of the act , which excludes as ineligible for admission the following persons : <PARA> that law , originally aimed at communists , could be used now to exclude persons ( both muslims and non - muslims ) who have demonstrated an affiliation or sympathy with violent extremist groups professing islamist motivations and goals ( e . g ., isis , al - qaeda , al - shabaab , boko haram ) from entering the u . s ., but asserting that it enables a de facto ban on all muslims is inaccurate . most major religions involve basic , agreed - upon sets of tenets by which their faithful live , and no widely - accepted understanding of islam encompasses a prohibition on following the laws of any country or advocates the overthrow of government . <PARA> the immigration and nationality act of 1952 was not without critics , among them president harry s . truman , who vetoed the bill on 25 june 1952 . in a letter titled “ veto of bill to revise the laws relating to immigration , naturalization , and nationality ” and addressed to the house of representatives , president truman described the bill ’ s provisions as both antithetical to american values and discriminatory : <PARA> in that letter president truman further maintained the act ’ s provisions were out of alignment with foreign policy goals , inhibiting immigrants who needed it most from seeking safe harbor in america : <PARA> truman ’ s words seemed exceptionally prescient when he spoke of citizens in countries that had in recent years fallen behind the iron curtain : <PARA> in that letter , president truman spoke specifically of immigration quotas arranged deliberately to exclude specific nationalities . a large portion of the letter directly addressed truman ’ s belief that the american way of life ought to be extended to those living under the same totalitarian regimes the u . s . hoped to vanquish . truman lamented that in “ no other realm of our national life are we so hampered and stultified by the dead hand of the past , as we are in this field of immigration .” <PARA> the “ islam was banned from the usa in 1952 ” claim proved popular following a period of increasing rhetoric similar to that which truman decried as discriminatory and outdated in 1952 . the basic claim hinged on the tautological assertion that adherence to islam alone constitutes participation in an “ organization seeking to overthrow the government of the united states by ‘ force , violence , or other unconstitutional means .'”

unproven	amid the reporting about the background of a 23 - year - old man behind a string of march 2018 fatal bombings in austin , texas , some outlets published a claim that he was part of a christian homeschooling group in which members learned how to use weapons . <PARA> authorities say that mark anthony conditt killed himself as they were preparing to arrest him in connection with the making of five package bombs that detonated across the city and at a fedex facility in nearby schertz , texas . <PARA> conditt was reportedly raised as a christian . his mother has confirmed that he was homeschooled . but one story , published by buzzfeed following his death , included an allegation from a 21 - year - old woman describing a group she identified as righteous invasion of truth ( also referred to as “ riot ” for short ) which she said was created — and named — by a group of homeschooling families . <PARA> “ a lot of us were very into science ; we would discuss chemicals and how to mix them and which ones were dangerous ,” cassia schultz said . “ we were into weapons and stuff . a lot of us did role - playing , and rpg [ role - playing games ]; we ’ d have foam weapons and act out a battle .” <PARA> according to schultz , riot members engaged in bible study at events , and also “ carried knives and learned how to shoot guns at gun ranges .” however , she said she did not remember members discussing how to make explosives . <PARA> the claims about conditt ’ s association have been cited in support of an argument that authorities have downplayed his actions specifically because he was a white man whose family identified as christians . a christian recording artist , carman , released an album titled righteous invasion of truth in 1995 but it is unclear whether the album was the inspiration for the purported group ’ s name . however , austin police have not yet confirmed or denied the claim . <PARA> conditt reportedly confessed to the bombings in a 25 - minute video police found on his cell phone . interim police chief brian manley said following conditt ’ s death that “ he does not at all mention anything about terrorism , nor does he mention anything about hate . but instead it is the outcry of a very challenged young man talking about challenges in his personal life .”

unproven	this is the second time i have written you , and i don ’ t blame you for not answering me , because i kind of sounded crazy , but it is a fact that we have a tradition in our family of ice cream for dessert after dinner each <PARA> night . but the kind of ice cream varies so , every night , after we ’ ve eaten , the whole family votes on which kind of ice cream we should have and i drive down to the store to get it . <PARA> it ’ s also a fact that i recently purchased a new pontiac and since then my trips to the store have created a problem . you see , every time i buy <PARA> vanilla ice cream , when i start back from the store my car won ’ t start . if i get any other kind of ice cream , the car starts just fine . <PARA> i want you to know i ’ m serious about this question , no matter how silly it sounds : ‘ what is there about a pontiac that makes it not start when i get vanilla ice cream , and easy to start whenever i get any other kind ?'” <PARA> the pontiac president was understandably skeptical about the letter , but sent an engineer to check it out anyway . the latter was surprised to be greeted by a successful , obviously well educated man in a fine neighborhood . he had arranged to meet the man just after dinner time , so the two hopped into the car and drove to the ice cream store . it was vanilla ice cream that night and , sure enough , after they came back to the car , it wouldn ’ t start . <PARA> the engineer returned for three more nights . the first night , the man got chocolate . the car started . the second night , he got strawberry . the car started . the third night he ordered vanilla . the car failed to start . <PARA> now the engineer , being a logical man , refused to believe that this man ’ s car was allergic to vanilla ice cream . he arranged , therefore , to continue his visits for as long as it took to solve the problem . and toward this end he began to take notes : he jotted down all sorts of data , time of day , type of gas used , time to drive back and forth , etc . in a short time , he had a clue : the man took less time to buy vanilla than any other flavor . why ? the answer was in the layout of the store . <PARA> vanilla , being the most popular flavor , was in a separate case at the front of the store for quick pickup . all the other flavors were kept in the back of the store at a different counter where it took considerably longer to find the flavor and get checked out . now the question for the engineer was why the car wouldn ’ t start when it took less time . <PARA> once time became the problem — not the vanilla ice cream — the engineer quickly came up with the answer : vapor lock . it was happening every night , but the extra time taken to get the other flavors allowed the engine to cool down sufficiently to start . when the man got vanilla , the engine was still too hot for the vapor lock to dissipate . <PARA> moral of the story : even insane - looking problems are sometimes real . <PARA> variations : <PARA> the mystified driver complains to the car dealership ; sometimes he contacts the car ’ s manufacturer . <PARA> origins : this legend surfaced in print in 1978 , but an anecdotal sighting places it even earlier than that , in 1971 . though its exact beginnings can ’ t be pinpointed , according to brunvand : <PARA> the june 1978 issue of traffic safety magazine printed the story , citing as its source the car magazine automotive engineering . <PARA> it ’ s interesting to note how the “ vapor lock ” explanation reversed itself over time . earlier versions mentioned a flavor of ice cream that required handpacking ( while all the others were prepackaged and ready to go ); the vapor lock was said to form because it took so much longer to get out of the store with this one flavor . in newer versions , we ’ re told that vanilla was a popular flavor and was kept in a special case near the door , making purchasing it and getting back out to the car take considerably less time ; the car then wouldn ’ t start because the vapor lock did not have enough time to dissipate . <PARA> barbara “ rocky rhodes scholar ” mikkelson <PARA> sightings : <PARA> this legend also shows up as a car talk puzzler .

false	the notion that “ offended ” muslims want to ban the sale or use of pork products in the u . s . and european countries is a common trope in the online misinformation sphere , one that was trotted out yet again in a june 20 , 2019 , article on the bustatroll . org website claiming u . s . rep . ilhan omar ( a muslim ) was advocating for americans to start consuming dog meat rather than pork : <PARA> this was not true , of course : neither omar nor anyone else in the u . s . congress has encouraged americans to turn away from pork products in favor of dog meat . the story was a complete fabrication from bustatroll , a site that is part of the america ’ s last line of defense ( llod ) network of websites and social media accounts infamous for generating politically inflammatory misinformation under the guise of proffering “ satire .”

false	a meme that contained a claim from the 2016 u . s . presidential - election cycle suddenly began circulating on facebook in late january 2019 , a product of a feature that allows users to apply a brightly - colored background and large font to status updates : <PARA> the meme ’ s claim was an apparent holdover from the election in which president donald trump won an electoral college victory , securing him the white house , but lost the popular vote to his opponent , hillary clinton , by a margin of almost 2 . 9 million votes . this disparity prompted a prominent but baseless conspiracy theory that non - citizens had illegally cast millions of ballots for clinton — a conspiracy theory that trump himself promoted : <PARA> once in office , trump continued to pursue the claim , going so far as to create a commission that was eventually disbanded after having found no evidence of large - scale voter fraud . <PARA> as is often the case with facebook - generated memes , it cited no sources cited and no reference to where the information it presented came from . we were unable to locate any dhs material that disclosed the department ’ s discovery of 12 million uncounted votes , and our query to the department of homeland security ’ s ( dhs ) press team asking about the claim did not receive a response . <PARA> after trump disbanded the voter - fraud commission , the white house stated he had “ asked the department of homeland security to review its [ the commission ’ s ] initial findings and determine next courses of action .” but shortly after that statement was released , reuters reported that multiple “ officials and sources familiar with the matter said they were unaware of plans within dhs , a sprawling agency responsible for a wide array of national security issues , to investigate voter fraud .” <PARA> although one would expect the finding of 12 million - plus uncounted votes for trump to hit the news cycle like a tornado , no such reporting has emerged . in december 2018 , dhs did release a study stating that as of january 2015 , an estimated 12 million undocumented people resided in the u . s . other news stories in which the figure “ 12 million ” appeared included reports that democratic lawmakers lost seats in the u . s . senate despite securing 12 million more votes in aggregate than republicans during the 2018 midterm elections . but none of those stories was related to the discovery of 12 million uncounted votes . <PARA> the very premise of this claim is also fairly implausible . were the 12 million uncounted trump ballots that had been tabulated but not reported ? if so , what precinct or jurisdiction could have experienced a whopping 12 - million - plus vote undercount without its having been noticed until years after the fact — a number that is greater that the entire number of ballots cast in any single state other than california ? if the 12 million uncounted trump votes were ballots that had not been tabulated , then how could someone have obtained tens of millions of uncounted ballots , sifted through them to pluck out all the trump votes , and returned the rest to the counting stream , all to deadline and without detection ? <PARA> it remains unclear whether the meme simply attempted to shift the original story line from “ millions of undocumented people voted for clinton in 2016 ” to “ 12 million votes were stolen from trump in 2016 .” however , we have located no evidence that the meme was based on any facts .
mixture	on 20 october 2015 , the web site the federalist papers shared a meme in a post titled “ brutal meme reveals truth about european socialist countries ” which included a photograph of a woman and various criticisms about denmark ’ s general way of life : <PARA> that meme was something of a rebuttal to an earlier , similar graphic that had lauded denmark ’ s social infrastructure : <PARA> ( the woman pictured in both these memes is danish actress mille dinesen , her photograph taken from promotional material for the tv show rita .) <PARA> the text of the “ rebuttal ” meme began by stating : <PARA> a reliable estimate of the average salary for teachers in denmark is somewhat tricky to calculate due to variables such as tenure and location . however , a 2014 estimate provided an income figure of just under $ 42 , 000 per year for danish teachers ( not $ 61 , 000 ). and it ’ s slightly simplistic to say all healthcare is free in denmark , as the cost of medical care varies depending upon residency status and coverage level . <PARA> the rebuttal also states that the minimum income tax is 40 % in denmark ( where tax revenue indeed comprised 48 . 6 % of the country ’ s gdp in 2013 ). taxpayers in denmark are subject to a progressive tax structure under which total taxes are between 41 to 56 percent of income [ pdf ]: <PARA> another portion of the meme indicated that denmark ’ s citizens were “ deeply dependent ” on welfare to survive , but the country ’ s unemployment rate of 6 . 3 % was not much higher than the united states ’ 5 . 3 % in the same period . <PARA> the meme continued : <PARA> value - added tax ( vat ) in denmark is indeed 25 %, though additional “ duties and fees ” weren ’ t specifically described by the meme . gasoline is typically sold by the liter ( not gallon ) in europe overall , and recent estimates provided a cost of $ 1 . 69 per liter in denmark ( or just under $ 6 . 40 a gallon , not $ 10 ). it ’ s true that new cars in denmark are taxed at 180 %, in large part because denmark ( like some other countries ) imposes higher costs of operation for private automobiles to encourage residents to use public transport and more energy efficient and lower polluting forms of transportation . <PARA> definitively selecting a single country to claim the title of “ highest - taxed ” is a slippery endeavor , as the structure of taxation varies significantly from one country to the next . reports on taxes across the globe ( including a popular annual data set released by firm pwc ) almost never declare any one country the most - taxed ( in a vacuum ). myriad confounding factors ( such as relative cost of living , and whether social programs cover basic needs like healthcare ) render a binary comparison of that description virtually meaningless . however , a list titled “ these are the 19 countries with the highest tax rates in the world ” ( based on the world economic forum ’ s latest global competitiveness report ), published on 8 october 2015 didn ’ t include denmark among countries listed . <PARA> by the metric of income tax rates , organization for economic co - operation and development ( oecd ) data for 2015 placed denmark third - highest ( behind belgium and germany ). similar , earlier data ranked denmark behind france , italy , and croatia . as such , denmark doesn ’ t even have the highest tax rate in europe ( much less the world ). <PARA> we were unable to corroborate the claim that “ 80 % on every dollar earned ” in denmark goes toward taxes , and determining which nations could be accurately described as having the highest amount of personal debt in the world again hinges largely on variable factors such as gdp , average income , and number of citizens . ( without specifics , those numbers could easily be distorted by fluctuations in population , for instance .) <PARA> oecd data for 2014 indicated denmark had the highest percentage of household debt based on percentage of disposable income : <PARA> that same table placed denmark mid - to - high for comparative household net worth : <PARA> in 2013 denmark ’ s home ownership rate was roughly 63 % ( versus a comparable 65 % in the u . s .), making the statement that “ most residents would never own a home ” not very accurate . similarly , recent oecd data indicated that there are 70 cars for every 100 danes ( indicating car ownership may be expensive , but it isn ’ t rare ). a 2007 new york times article reported that some young danes opt to move abroad ( creating a skills drain ), but that piece focused on individuals and not companies with business roots in the country . <PARA> the meme concludes : <PARA> according to the world health organization ( who )’ s most recent statistics , denmark ’ s suicide rate was 8 . 8 people per 100 , 000 ( versus 12 . 1 per 100 , 000 in the united states ) in 2012 . who data from roughly a decade ago reported a suicide rate of 11 . 9 per 100 , 000 people in denmark ( versus 11 . 0 in the united states ). while the u . s . and denmark maintained similar rates of suicide per capita in years past , denmark ’ s suicide rate was markedly lower than that of the states by 2012 ( and didn ’ t appear to ever have been three times as high ). <PARA> determining which percentage of the danish population takes antidepressants is currently complicated by the fact that such data aren ’ t readily available as standard metrics on health care reports . a 2013 guardian article cited a survey conducted by eurobarometer indicating that 93 percent of danes reported never having taken antidepressants in their lives . presumably , the remaining seven percent weren ’ t all currently taking antidepressants , indicating the meme ’ s claim was likely unsupported . <PARA> oecd data from 2012 indicated that 85 doses of antidepressant medications were dispensed per thousand people per day ( ddd ) in denmark . directly comparable data from the united states with respect to ddd wasn ’ t available ( as that metric appears unique to europe ). estimates suggest that between eight and eleven percent of [ pdf ] americans are on antidepressants , and the 2013 study “ depression and antidepressants : a nordic perspective ” suggested fewer danes than americans took antidepressants at any given time ( while maintaining that nordic countries exhibited a higher rate of antidepressant use than europe overall ): <PARA> with respect to the claims made in the initial meme , it ’ s ( again ) not entirely true that danish schoolteachers earn $ 61 , 000 per year across the board . it ’ s true that danes are paid a stipend to go to university , and that college education is free for danish students ( and eu residents studying in that country ). as indicated above , healthcare is often administered at no charge to danes , depending on the service and their coverage status . and to reiterate , portions above addressed the prevalence of home ownership in denmark , which is roughly equivalent to that of the u . s ; personal ownership of vehicles is less common , but not by any means rare . <PARA> as for vacation time , workers in denmark are entitled to five paid weeks of it ( as well as additional compensated time off totaling about nine days , from which the “ six weeks ” figure was most likely derived ). denmark ’ s parental leave policies are among the most generous in the world , but 52 weeks ( or one year ) is on the upper end of leave with partial or total pay : <PARA> it ’ s true that pension kicks in for danes at the age of 65 . the original meme claimed that the average american spent $ 8 , 500 per year in deductibles , while the centers for disease control placed average total spending per patient per year at $ 9 , 255 in 2013 . we were unable to find a figure that specifically referenced “ deductibles ” as a health care expenditure - related metric , but the number cited closely matched world bank figures for per capita health expenditures . <PARA> cited college costs for students in the united states in the first meme weren ’ t exaggerated either : data from 2014 place the yearly cost of tuition at a low of $ 18 , 943 ( for in - state public schools ) and a high of $ 42 , 419 ( for out - of - state private schools ). if it ’ s surmised that three out of four students attend a local college at the cheaper tuition and one heads off to a private university , the average tuition between those four students would be $ 24 , 812 . <PARA> finally , denmark ’ s novel “ flexicurity ” policy deviates from other european nations ’ worker protection policies ( which are unlike american “ at will employment ” standards ). while danes can be more easily fired than those in other european countries , the country offers robust unemployment insurance compensation to level out labor market fluctuations . <PARA> in short , it ’ s true denmark ’ s taxes are far higher than those in the united states , but that ’ s offset by significantly reduced costs to citizens for expenditures such as healthcare , education , and child care . a gallon of gas doesn ’ t cost danes anywhere near $ 10 , but tax on new cars is 180 %. we were unable to find any ranking of denmark as the “ highest - taxed ” nation in the world ( or even just europe ), and home ownership rates are near what they are in the u . s . ( there are far more privately - owned vehicles in the united states than denmark , however .) denmark ’ s suicide rate is lower than that of the u . s ., and antidepressant usage is higher among americans . finally , while some young danes moved abroad due to high taxes on income , we were unable to find any evidence that was the case for companies .
false	an image purportedly showing a sign reading “ trump made america the best country in the nation ” ( while a smashed - up automobile lingers in the background ) is frequently circulated online along with disparaging remarks about the perceived foolishness of the president ’ s most ardent supporters : <PARA> this image , however , has been digitally manipulated . the original version of this sign read “ america is the best country in the nation ,” and at some point the words “ trump made ” were added to the first line , the word “ is ” was removed , and the “ the ” in the second line was moved to the center of the line . <PARA> here ’ s a higher resolution version of the original sign ( center ) as well as two other photographs of the sign taken from different angles : <PARA> we haven ’ t been able to pinpoint exactly where this sign was located , but images of the original have been in circulation since at least june 2016 ( before donald trump took office ). <PARA> furthermore , remnants of the original sign can still be seen upon a closer inspection of the viral image . whoever created this sign digitally copied some of the existing letters and pasted them into new positions , but as the letters were copied and pasted from one place to another , portions of adjacent letters , as well as the separating lines of the sign , were also moved . <PARA> this can most clearly be seen in the “ tr ” of “ trump ” which was taken from the “ tr ” in “ country ”: <PARA> we also found several other mistakes . partial letters can be spotted between the “ r ” and “ u ,” the “ u ” and “ m ”, and the “ m ” and “ p ” in trump ; the “ u ” in “ trump ” was taken from the “ u ” in “ country ” ( remnants of “ o ” precede the “ u ”); and the “ p ” in “ trump ” was taken from the “ b ” in “ best ” with the bottom curve of the “ b ” removed .
false	in mid - january 2020 , social media users shared a photograph of a mobile billboard with a critical message directed at u . s . sen . susan collins , r - maine . the truck appeared to be parked outside a bangor mansion that renowned novelist stephen king owns . <PARA> the house in the background of the photograph does indeed belong to king , and the author of such landmark horror stories as “ the shining ” has been vocal in his criticism of collins ( he has previously supported democratic candidates ). but king did not hire the billboard - carrying truck , and confirmed in a message to snopes that he had “ nothing to do with that truck .” <PARA> the billboards are the work of four progressive organizations — moveon , need to impeach , public citizen , and daily kos — and represent a $ 400 , 000 ad campaign targeting gop senators in ongoing impeachment proceedings against republican president donald trump . per the washington , d . c .- focused blog the hill , the ads have focused on eight senators and have implored citizens to contact the senators to demand a fair trial : <PARA> nick berning , spokesman for moveon , confirmed that while the truck with the sign was indeed parked in bangor near where both king ’ s property and collins ’ home are located , king had nothing to do with the campaign . <PARA> impeachment proceedings in the senate commenced on jan . 20 , 2020 , with acrimony over the rules of the process . the text on the billboards , which states , “ trump broke the law ... don ’ t help him cover it up . vote to convict and remove ,” reflects an accusation from democrats that trump and his republican supporters who hold a majority in the senate are withholding incriminating evidence against the president . <PARA> trump was impeached by the u . s . house in december 2019 on two articles of impeachment , obstructing congress and abuse of power . he is accused of using his office in an attempt to extract damaging information from ukraine on a potential 2020 campaign rival by withholding crucial military aid .
true	while evangelical leader franklin graham has been a staunch supporter of president donald trump , his father rev . billy graham publicly warned against the prospect of religious figures becoming too attached to a political stance . <PARA> several readers contacted us in january 2018 seeking to confirm a statement attributed to the elder graham : <PARA> the statement was also circulated online in meme form : <PARA> in this case , the quote is authentic , and taken from the 1 february 1981 cover story in parade magazine ; it was part of billy graham ’ s account of conversations with fellow reverend jerry falwell , who helmed the conservative politcal group the moral majority . graham said : <PARA> the statement was featured early on in the story and was also highlighted below a picture of falwell and then - president ronald reagan : <PARA> in the story , graham admitted that he no longer thought of communists as being “ disciples of lucifer ,” contrary to his own rhetoric from earlier in his career . he also cast himself as having no part of falwell ’ s organization , which became a key conservative constituency before dissolving in 1989 . he said : <PARA> while the elder graham has had relationships with several u . s . presidents spanning decades , he told christianity today in 2011 that , given the chance to do anything differently in his life , “ i also would have steered clear of politics .” <PARA> his son , on the other hand , has positioned himself as a trump supporter since 2011 , when he contributed to the debunked “ birther ” conspiracy theory that former president barack obama was not born in the united states . in october 2016 , the younger graham published a social media post ( misattributed to his father ) urging evangelical voters to vote for trump . <PARA> more recently , franklin graham has refused to criticize the president for reportedly calling african countries “ shitholes ” or for alleged extramarital affairs — drawing criticism from graham ’ s own niece — and claimed that the u . s . was “ in a coup d ’ etat ” perpetrated by political enemies of trump who were using the media against him .

unproven	origins : the term “ red light district ” is said to have originated with early railroaders . the men carried lit red lanterns when they left the train so in case of an emergency the crew caller would be able to find them . these lanterns were left outside bordellos when crew members stopped to pay the ladies a visit and sometimes were brought inside to be placed in a window . <PARA> though it is widely believed , i ’ m not quite sure what to make of this folk etymology . a railwayman ’ s lit red lantern left sitting in front of an establishment could just as easily have <PARA> come to signify a saloon or a barber shop as it did a brothel . on the other hand , the lit red lantern quietly residing outside a nondescript building of unclear purpose could well have come to be seen as a discreet advertisement of what was for sale within . <PARA> railroading has enriched our language with other , albeit more unusual , terms . those who earn their living from the rails know that a “ hoghead ” is an engineer and a “ gandydancer ” is a maintenance employee . “ puddlejumpers ” are clerks and “ carknockers ” are freight car repairmen . like seafaring before it , railroading created its own unique language . <PARA> where did these odd words come from ? according to charles albi , director of the colorado railroad museum in golden , “ gandydancer ” most likely comes from the gandy manufacturing company of chicago . they made many of the tools track workers used to lay rails . “ carknocker ” goes back to the primeval days of railroading , the 1830s , when men would go along inspecting the train to make sure there were no cracks in the iron . they ’ d take a hammer and knock the car wheel to see if it would ring properly . the locomotive was called “ the hog ,” because it was a big , powerful thing ; thus , the engineer became the “ hoghead .” <PARA> barbara “ full boar ” mikkelson

false	on 22 august 2018 , u . s . president donald trump tweeted criticism of the south african government for their plans to redistribute land to black south africans who were institutionally disenfranchised under that country ’ s apartheid system : <PARA> the “ large scale killings ” phrase included in trump ’ s tweet was an invocation of “ white genocide ,” a conspiracy theory popular among white supremacists who have for years been attempting to advance the baseless claim that white south african farmers are being systematically murdered en masse . it is an idea that until now has existed mainly on the fringes , fostered by proponents including white nationalist and former klansman david duke — who jubilantly responded to trump ’ s tweet : <PARA> “ what particularly pleased [ white supremacists like duke ] was the notion that if trump said it , lots of conservatives would start to believe it , whereas they themselves have been having trouble getting widespread support for this notion ,” said mark pitcavage , senior research fellow for the center on extremism and the anti - defamation league ( adl ). <PARA> sure enough , white supremacist richard spencer also tweeted his support for trump ’ s “ opening up ” the conversation about “ the plight of white south africans ”: <PARA> the “ white genocide ” claim started gaining popularity among fringe groups around 2012 , according to research conducted by the adl , who released a statement characterizing trump ’ s tweet as “ disturbing ”: <PARA> that ’ s not to say that farm attacks and farm killings do not happen in south africa — they do , every year . but pitcavage pointed out that although such events are tragic and reprehensible , they have been spun into a twisted story that proponents imagine to be representative of what ’ s in store for whites in the united states , pitcavage said : <PARA> despite president trump ’ s directive to secretary of state pompeo , no evidence documents an epidemic of murders targeting white south african farmers because of their race . the number of farm murders in south africa hit a 30 - year low point in 2017 - 18 , according to a report released by the south african agricultural industry ( agrisa ) that cited south african police data . overall , farm attacks have also been on a general decline after spiking in 2001 - 02 at 1 , 069 , although since hitting a low point in 2013 - 14 that figure has been on the rise .

unproven	examples : <PARA> a friend of a former colleague told me about an incident that recently befell his boss on a train . he was feeling chuffed at claiming a four - seat table for himself and settled down to a nice quiet journey reading his book . the whistle blew and as the train lurched away , a loud , acne ’ d yuppie trousered his way into the carriage , threw his bags down on the table , collapsed into the seat opposite , and immediately brandished his portable phone and began a loud , oafish conversation — “ buy ... sell ... take a rain check ... hyper !” — that sort of thing . <PARA> the quieter man couldn ’ t believe his misfortune and tried to ignore the boorish city type , but he was so noisy , ringing up people and rustling papers and shouting , <PARA> “ yah ... yah ... yah ” into the phone all the time , that the bloke couldn ’ t take any more and set off with his stuff for another part of the train . <PARA> he ’ d just sat down when an old man opposite him went pale and groaned . he was having a heart attack and collapsed on the floor . the guard arrived as passengers tried to come to the old gent ’ s aid , and he explained that they ’ d have to wait ’ til the next station before they could phone as the train ’ s communication lines were down . <PARA> “ i know someone with a phone !” said the bloke happily . “ we can ring ahead and have an ambulance waiting for him at the station .” <PARA> so the guard , the bloke and some other concerned passengers marched triumphantly back down the carriage . the yuppie was still in mid - conversation when the guard cut in to explain the situation and ask him , as it was an emergency , if they might have the use of his portable phone . <PARA> at first the yuppie waved them away as if he was busy , still talking down the line . but when they persisted and got increasingly agitated , he threw the phone down , went the colour of beetroot and looking down mumbled , “ you can ’ t . it ’ s only a fake phone .” <PARA> [ collected on the internet , 1998 ] <PARA> there was this chap on the train with me who was completing some stupendous business via a mobile phone . the deal is closed and the caller obviously comes away a wealthy man . a short while later someone on the train suffers a heart attack . the call goes out : “ who ’ s got a mobile phone ?,” “ that chap over there ! he ’ s got one .” the chap with the mobile sort of coughs , look sheepish and admits the mobile is a toy . <PARA> origins : though cell phones are a relatively recent innovation , the desire to impress others is not . predating these cell phone tales are older ones along the same theme of a pompous man ’ s impressive phone conversation being revealed as a put -

mixture	in july 2016 an image featuring quotes attributed to barack obama , uttered in 2008 about his then political opponent hillary clinton , was circulated on social media just as clinton was claiming the 2016 democratic presidential nomination : <PARA> the first half of the quote reproduced in the image , at least , can be loosely attributed to barack obama . although he didn ’ t actually say those words , the phrase “ she will say anything and change nothing ” was part of a voiceover narration used in a radio spot approved by obama during the 2008 democratic primaries : <PARA> although this radio attack ad focused on clinton ’ s trustworthiness , the phrase “ hillary can ’ t be trusted and isn ’ t qualified to be president ” did not appear in it , and we found no record of barack obama ’ s having otherwise uttered or used this phrase during the 2008 campaign . such a charge would also have been problematic for the young illinois senator to have made during the 2008 election , as back then obama was seen as the more unqualified and inexperienced candidate compared to hillary clinton . <PARA> interestingly , when abc news covered this ad in 2008 , they presciently wrote that it was “ so harsh ” that they wouldn ’ t be surprised if the gop eventually used it against hillary clinton :
unproven	when the story detailed below about a would - be gasoline thief who tried to siphon from the wrong tank on an recreational vehicle ( rv ) appeared in the [ scottish ] daily record in may 2004 , it sounded awfully familiar : <PARA> the very same story had made the news back in 1991 : <PARA> and even back in 1991 that story sounded familiar , because folklorist jan harold brunvand had described it as a well - known example of the ‘ hilarious accident ’ genre of urban legend in a book published ten years earlier : <PARA> is this story “ true ”? in a technical sense it ’ s an urban legend whether or not the event described ever actually happened in real life , because what makes a tale an urban legend is not its underlying truth or falsity , but that the same story is told over and over with differing details of time , place , and person . note that although the three examples we quote here supposedly relate three different occurrences of similar incidents taking place over a span of more than twenty years , they all tell the same story in the very same way : the would - be gasoline thief is never caught in the act — his attempts are always discovered after the fact , his actions are always inferred from visual evidence , and the visual evidence is always the same ( siphoning equipment and a pool of vomit ). <PARA> moreover , the putative explanation seems rather improbable for a number of reasons : <PARA> a thief attempting to breach the wrong tank would have to bypass the obvious gas cap on the side of the vehicle in favor of crawling around on the ground and looking for valves on the underside of the motor home . one would think this activity would awaken in even the dumbest the realization that something is not at all right . (“ geez , how are you supposed to get the nozzle from the gas pump into this thing ? the guy who owns this rig must end up covered with gasoline every time he tries to fill his tank , and that ’ s only if he can get the hose from the gas pump to stretch this far .”) some versions of the legend get around this implausibility by positing that the rv ’ s owner had converted a spare gas tank into a black water tank . <PARA> on the other hand , to paraphrase h . l . mencken , no one ever lost money underestimating the stupidity of common crooks , especially those who might be operating under the additionally handicapping effects of alcohol or drugs . <PARA> whatever the underlying truth , the “ gas - siphoning thief ” story is a classic urban legend : a tale just plausible enough to maybe have played out in real life , but one too improbable to have occurred as many times ( and always in the same fashion ) as commonly reported .

mixture	on more than one occasion , members of the trump administration have expressed disdain for “ the new colossus ,” the immigrant - welcoming poem inscribed on a plaque embedded on the base of the statue of liberty in new york . <PARA> it happened most recently on aug . 13 , 2019 , during an interview on national public radio . ken cuccinelli , acting head of u . s . citizenship and immigration services , discussed a new trump administration rule to penalize legal immigrants who seek public assistance . in the course of the interview , cuccinelli quoted the famous poem penned by emma lazarus , but changed some of the words . <PARA> the comment came in response to a question from npr ’ s rachel martin , who asked cuccinelli if he would agree that the poem etched on the statue of liberty , “‘ give me your tired , your poor ,’ are also part of the american ethos ?” to this cuccinelli responded , “ they certainly are , ‘ give me your tired and your poor who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge ,'” cuccinelli responded , ad - libbing the end of the sentence . <PARA> the actual quote reads , “ give me your tired , your poor , your huddled masses yearning to breathe free , the wretched refuse of your teeming shore . send these , the homeless , tempest - tost to me , i lift my lamp beside the golden door !” <PARA> cuccinelli ’ s remark set off public outrage in some circles . he has been discussing a new trump administration “ public - charge ” rule that would penalize immigrants seeking american citizenship for using public benefits . critics pointed to the statement as a betrayal of , as martin stated , the american ethos of welcoming not just immigrants but as the 19th - century poem states , “ your tired , your poor , your huddled masses yearning to breathe free .” <PARA> backlash from cuccinelli ’ s statement resulted in a number of headlines reporting the trump administration was rewriting or revising the statue of liberty poem , causing confusion among some readers who asked whether the plaque would be altered . <PARA> although cuccinelli put his personal spin on the poem , written in 1883 and engraved on a bronze plate secured to the base of lady liberty in 1903 , he did not state that anyone in the trump administration had the intention of removing or altering the words on it . in fact during a press briefing about the public - charge rule , given by cuccinelli on aug . 12 , a reporter specifically asked cuccinelli whether the words on the statue of liberty should be changed or the plaque be taken down . <PARA> “ well i ’ m certainly not prepared to take anything down off the statue of liberty ,” cuccinelli responded . “ we have a long history of being one of the most welcoming in the world on a lot of bases , whether you be an asylee , whether you be coming here to join your family or immigrating yourself . ... i do not think by any means , we ’ re ready to take anything off the statue of liberty .” <PARA> although cuccinelli made an impromptu comment , adding words to an existing poem that don ’ t belong to it , he was not suggesting actually revising the words inscribed on the statue of liberty or removing them , so we rate the truth of this claim “ mixture .” despite taking a hard line on immigration that critics say run counter to american ideals , the trump administration has not proposed altering the statue of liberty . <PARA> cuccinelli ’ s take on the poem was later challenged in an op - ed in the new york times , authored by esther schor , a professor of jewish studies at princeton . lazarus , the poem ’ s author , was known for helping jewish refugees from eastern europe . schor wrote , “ ms . lazarus not only insisted that american jews come to the aid of jewish refugees ; two years later , she wrote ‘ the new colossus ’ to argue that aiding the poor and oppressed of all lands was the mission of all americans , the mission of america itself .”
mixture	in september 2015 , social media interest escalated in the outcome of a firearms - related court case involving a man named dontray mills : <PARA> mills , then 24 years old , was arrested in april 2014 after the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firearms and explosives ( atf ) investigated his involvement in multiple firearms transactions between 2012 and 2014 : <PARA> news accounts referenced “ straw purchases ,” a practice wherein individuals who wish to purchase firearms but are unwilling or unable to legally do so obtain them secondhand by having other parties by the weapons on their behalf . the court case involving mills attracted little attention before the 19 august 2015 publication of a milwaukee journal - sentinel article titled “ judge repeats gun rights slogan during sentencing for illegal buys ”: <PARA> according to the meme shown above , mills ’ plea bargain was negotiated by the department of justice ( or in some versions , the obama administration or president obama himself ). however , mills ’ sentence was seemingly light because he pleaded guilty to only one of the numerous charges against him , and the choice of giving mills probation rather than jail time was not the result of instructions from the justice department ( or higher ) but rather the personal discretion of judge rudolph randa ( who was appointed as a federal district judge by president george h . w . bush and has a history of making controversial decisions ), based on his view of mills ’ contrition and likelihood of re - offending : <PARA> as is often the case , dontray mills remained largely out of the news after he was sentenced , with no additional reporting revealing any details of the plea bargain under which he was sentenced to probation . although the united states district court for the eastern district of wisconsin represents the federal government in criminal cases such as the one involving mills , it ’ s merely one of 94 district courts that try cases ( and agree to plea bargains ) each day in the united states . by all credible accounts , mills ’ plea was a relatively small affair granted by a judge sympathetic to his acceptance of responsibility and non - criminal ambitions , not a function of some furtive agenda by president obama working through the justice department to go easy on illegal gun traffickers .
mixture	examples : [ collected via e - mail , may 2012 ] <PARA> to all concerned , <PARA> lowe ’ s is now selling american flag doormats . as memorial day and 4th of july is approaching , many stores are trying to increase their profits . needless to say , the selling of american flag doormats has many veterans upset . veterans feel that they fought for the american flag , many losing their lives , and many permanently injured for the freedoms that the american flag represents , yet lowe ’ s is now selling the american flag as a doormat , ” something to be walked on , and something to wipe your feet on ”, as one veteran put it . “ are they slapping our faces or what ”, asked another veteran . <PARA> the v . f . w ., the american legion , and several other organizations was immediately contacted . a veteran with 33 years in the u . s . navy , had went to lowe ’ s to buy $ 300 . 00 worth of lumber to build a fence , but when he saw the american flag doormat , he flipped out , made lowe ’ s take back the lumber and refund his money . several others walked out of the store . at the lowe ’ s in n . charleston , sc , the manager took all the doormats off of display because of complaints and called lowe ’ s headquarters to report the consumer ’ s and veterans complaints . <PARA> those who grew up respecting the american flag , and those who fought to defend it , would never let the american flag touch the ground , much less use it as a doormat , to walk on or wipe your feet on it ! <PARA> most likely these doormats are made in china , but they are distributed by : <PARA> mohawk home <PARA> 3032 sugar valley rd ., nw <PARA> sugar valley , georgia 30746 <PARA> please pass this on to as many people you can . some of us still respect and love america and our flag , and what it represents . <PARA> origins : back in may 2012 the item reproduced above began circulating on the internet , expressing disapproval that the lowe ’ s chain of home improvement stores was selling an american flag doormat distributed by mohawk home . the basis for this complaint was initially something of a puzzle , as neither the lowe ’ s nor the mohawk home flooring web site listed a u . s . flag doormat among the many styles of doormats they offered , and inquiries to both companies produced responses indicating that while they did sell doormats themed with patriotic colors , they did not vend doormats picturing the american flag . <PARA> lowe ’ s replied that : <PARA> like many retailers , lowe ’ s offers a variety of home décor items that help homeowners prepare to commemorate three very important dates in our country — memorial day , flag day and july 4th . <PARA> among the items available are doormats ; however , the doormats have patriotic colors and none have images of the american flag . also , the doormats are made in the usa , not china . <PARA> among the items available are doormats ; however , the doormats have patriotic colors and none have images of the american flag . also , the doormats are made in the usa , not china . <PARA> and mohawk home responded : <PARA> thank you for contacting us . have you seen the doormat that is in question ? we have some that are patriotic in theme with the colors of red , white and blue . we do not have a mat that is the flag . i am sorry for the confusion . the majority of our products are still made in the usa — right here in north ga . please search “ still made in the usa by mohawk home ” on youtube if you are interested on learning more about what our company stands for . <PARA> eventually an example of the the doormat in question ( sold at some lowe ’ s outlets and made by mohawk ) was identified . it wasn ’ t technically a reproduction of the u . s . flag itself , but it contained elements and colors of the u . s . flag and was apparently close enough to the real thing to have become the focus of complaints : <PARA> literal depictions of the u . s . flag on doormats do exist , however , and other retailers have responded to consumer complaints by removing them from their inventories .

true	in may 2018 , survivors of the parkland school shooting massacre , and many others both on and off social media , responded with horror at reports of a video game in which players could assume the role of a school shooter . <PARA> jaclyn corin , a survivor of the feb . 14 , 2018 mass shooting at marjory stoneman douglas high school , called the game ( which is titled active shooter ) “ disgusting ” in a tweet and urged others to sign a petition calling for the game not to be released .

true	origins : the above - quoted essay attributed to charlie daniels began circulating via e - mail in early november 2001 . its authorship is not in question : it was indeed penned by the famed singer / songwriter and can be found on his web site in his soapbox section . <PARA> “ this ain ’ t no rag , it ’ s a flag ” has been giving the pot of controversy a good stir . the facts as reported in daniels ’ essay are accurate — he was scheduled to appear as one of the entertainers at an october 20 nashville benefit , the country freedom concert , and he did cancel out because the event ’ s organizers asked him to refrain from performing this song . “ if the song is offensive , i figured my presence there also would be offensive ,” he told the hollywood reporter . <PARA> the song has proved to be wildly popular . it debuted at # 51 on the billboard country music singles chart in early november , and requests to play it have poured into country music radio stations . traffic at his web site , www . charliedaniels . com , the only place to buy “ rag ,” has soared . the song does strike a responsive chord with a number of folks and does give voice to widespread sentiment , hence its popularity . of course , the song does not speak for everyone ( what song could ?), but it ’ s clear a significant number of people do find a sense of empowerment in it . it ’ s a war song , and it ’ s meant to stir up the blood . at this , it succeeds remarkably <PARA> well . <PARA> the question of whether “ rag ’ s ” message is the right one for america at this time is too large an imponderable for this site to try to address . suffice it to say , some will love this song because it fiercely cries out what ’ s in their hearts , and some will hate it because they disagree with its cowboy justice posture . discussion of “ rag ” at the family dinner table thus guarantees lively debate , possibly escalating to pot slinging and plate slamming incidents wholly unrelated to the food . <PARA> the opening lines of this battle cry have proved especially offensive to some . “ this ain ’ t no rag , it ’ s a flag ; and we don ’ t wear it on our heads ” has been parsed by some muslim americans as a slam of their customs and of them — they interpret the reference to a rag ’ s being worn on the head as applying to their traditional head coverings , thus perceive the song as equating all muslims (“ ragheads ”) with the object of the song ’ s ire , which are terrorists . <PARA> those attuned to issues of flag etiquette could view that opening stanza in a more innocuous fashion , as a not - so - gentle reminder that it ’ s disrespectful to wear the american flag or representations of it as an item of clothing ( as explained in section 4 ( d ) of the 1976 executive order regarding flag laws and regulations : “ the flag should never be used as wearing apparel , bedding , or drapery ”). bandanas decorated with the stars and stripes of the u . s . flag , though popular , are thus improper displays of patriotism . ( so are boxer shorts made of the flag , but what goes on inside a fellow ’ s pants is generally a matter just between him and his levis .) <PARA> it should be noted , however , that charlie daniels himself has never espoused the flag etiquette explanation . but in various interviews , the singer has explained that the angry sentiments expressed in the song are exclusively aimed at the terrorists behind the september 11 attack on america and that he deplores any violence or abuse toward law - abiding islamic people . “ we can no more blame it on good middle eastern citizens than we can blame hitler on people of german descent ,” said daniels . <PARA> barbara “ charlie ’ s angle ” mikkelson
mixture	that the green hornet , who battled crime on the radio airwaves from 1936 to 1952 , bore many resemblances to a modern day lone ranger was no coincidence . both programs were created under the aegis of george w . trendle at wxyz in detroit ; thus both had similar three - word titles consisting of “ the ” followed by a monosyllabic adjective and a two - syllable noun , and both featured main characters who fought crime while remaining outside the realm of official law enforcement ( and were often mistaken for outlaws themselves ), had faithful sidekicks ( both of whom were men of different ethnicities with two - syllable names ending in ‘ o ’), employed masks in their crime - fighting guises to create secret identities , and always refrained from killing or maiming the foes with whom they tangled . <PARA> and although the metropolitan green hornet could hardly be expected to pursue lawbreakers mounted on horseback as his western precursor did ( on his faithful steed silver ), the similarity between the two heroes was reinforced by the green hornet ’ s automotive conveyance possessing a name (“ black beauty ”) that was both equine and formed from a color word . the link between these two unconventional lawmen was made more explicit by a background history that made the lone ranger the great - uncle of britt reid , the “ daring young publisher ” who matched “ wits with the underworld , risking his life that criminals and racketeers ” might feel “ the sting of the green hornet !” <PARA> unlike the previous century ’ s lone ranger , however , the green hornet had a crime - fighting companion whose heritage became potentially troublesome in light of current events . kato , britt reid ’ s valet , was an asian of japanese descent , a distinction of some consequence when events in the pacific in the late 1930s and early 1940s , capped by a surprise japanese attack on the american naval base at pearl harbor on 7 december 1941 , inexorably drew japan and the united states into war with each other . against this background ( and the resultant anti - japanese backlash in america ) arose the legend that the character of kato was originally identified as being japanese , but after pearl harbor his nationality was abruptly changed . <PARA> several different explanations have been offered about exactly what took place regarding kato ’ s nationality after the beginning of world war ii , including claims that : <PARA> the real answer is a somewhat confusing mixture of elements from all of these explanations . <PARA> although print ads run before the premiere airing of the green hornet on radio described kato as “ the jap butler ,” the first two broadcasts simply referred to him as an “ oriental ”; not until the third episode was he characterized as japanese ( a nationality which matched that of the actor who portrayed him , tokutaro hayashi ). kato ’ s nationality became problematic after japanese military incursions into china escalated into war between those two countries in mid - 1937 ( with american political sentiment decidedly on the side of the chinese ), so beginning in january 1938 ( nearly four full years before the attack on pearl harbor ) kato reverted to being an “ oriental ” who served as britt reid ’ s “ faithful valet ” ( rather than his “ japanese valet ”). as noted in grams and salomonson ’ s history of the the green hornet , as early as 18 july 1939 , more than two years before the pearl harbor attack and american entry into world war ii , a green hornet radio script referred to kato as reid ’ s “ filipino valet ” ( although the word “ filipino ” was later scratched out and replaced with “ faithful ”), as writer fran striker wrestled with how to introduce an unexplained change in kato ’ s nationality to the radio audience . <PARA> the change in nationality was eventually implemented , and starting with the broadcast of 21 june 1941 , kato was specifically referred to as filipino . however , after july 1941 several months passed with no subsequent reference to kato ’ s filipino nationality , and ( due in part to the time lag between the completion of scripts and the production of episodes ) the next mention of kato ’ s filipino background didn ’ t take place until the broadcast of 10 january 1942 , a month after the pearl harbor attack . since just a few sparse references to kato as a filipino had been made several months prior to pearl harbor , and those references resumed shortly after pearl harbor , many listeners naturally remembered the attack on pearl harbor as the dividing line between kato ’ s shifting japanese / filipino background . <PARA> so , to sum up : <PARA> kato ’ s national origins became even more confused by productions of the green hornet in other media . the 1940 universal pictures green hornet film serial portrayed kato as korean , and press material for the short - lived mid - 1960s green hornet television series indirectly referred to kato ( played by martial arts star bruce lee ) as chinese . <PARA> a similar type of sudden character change took place forty years later , with the 1981 debut of the television series the greatest american hero , a superhero parody show featuring a caped , crime - fighting high school teacher named ralph hinkley . just a few weeks later , president ronald reagan was the target of an assassination attempt by a man named john hinckley , and the show ’ s main character was thereafter referred to simply as “ mr . h ” ( and occasionally “ mr . hanley ”), although his original name of “ hinkley ” was eventually restored later in the series ’ run .

unproven	while many of us like our ice cream unadorned , some could not properly enjoy a cone of their favorite flavor without its first being dipped into or sprinkled with jimmies , a colored candy decoration commonly used on ice cream , cupcakes , and donuts . however , as the example above illustrates , for some it ’ s a guilty pleasure because they ’ ve been told their preferred name for the multi - hued sweet sprinklings packs a racist wallop : <PARA> the dictionary of american regional english defines jimmies as “ tiny balls or rod - shaped bits of candy used as a topping for ice - cream , cakes and other sweets .” this confection goes by many names , including ‘ sprinkles ’, ‘ nonpareils ,’ and ‘ hundreds and thousands ,’ but even among those who refer to them as ‘ jimmies ’ there is contention — some say all colors of this topping are properly styled ‘ jimmies ,’ while others assert only the brown ones are called that , with other shades of the sweet stuff being termed ‘ sprinkles .’ <PARA> there are two theories as to why anyone might think there ’ s a racist connotation to the name : one focuses on the brown color of what some say are the only true jimmies ; the other posits that the name is a reference to jim crow , the title character in a well - known minstrel song of the 1830s . ( jim crow quickly became a slang term for anything having to do with african - americans , particularly items of a racist bent , such as the jim crow laws that segregated blacks from whites in the south .) <PARA> no valid reason exists to suppose that ‘ jimmies ’ carries a racist meaning or had a racially - charged origin . however , it ’ s difficult to definitively disprove the claim because the term ’ s entry into the english language is downright murky . <PARA> the theory cited most often attributes the naming of the confection to the just born company , a candymaking operation founded in brooklyn in 1923 who now produce such popular treats as ‘ peeps ’ and ‘ mike and ike .’ just born have long maintained that not only did they come up with the name “ jimmies ,” but they invented the product ( i . e ., chocolate sprinkles ) as well : <PARA> the notion that just born “ invented ” chocolate sprinkles is specious , however , as newspaper references to chocolate sprinkles antedate the founding of the company : <PARA> but even if just born didn ’ t invent chocolate sprinkles , could they at least have been the source that first called them “ jimmies ”? beth kimmerle , author of candy : the sweet history , ventured the opinion that just born created the term “ jimmies ” as a way of branding an extant product as their own : <PARA> some sources identify the just born employee for whom jimmies were supposedly named as jimmy bartholomew , a fellow who began working for just born in 1930 and manned the machine that made the confection . however , that too may be myth , as just born co - ceo ross born couldn ’ t positively confirm “ jimmy ”‘ s surname . also , certain respected slang dictionaries ( such as cassell ’ s dictionary of slang and random house historical dictionary of american slang ) trace “ jimmies ” to the 1920s , which would place the naming of the item prior to the purported machine operator ’ s stint with just born in 1930 . <PARA> as to how else the term could have entered the language , another theory suggests it as a short form of the venerable english slang word jim - jam . while jim - jam has a number of meanings , one that ’ s been around since the 16th century is “ a trivial article or knick - knack .” by the lights of the jim - jam theory , the “ trivial ” aspect of that one particular meaning translated to the confection now called jimmies . <PARA> however , that theory has a number of holes in it . first , according to the oxford english dictionary ( which is the bible of word histories for the english language ), the only meanings common to both jim - jam and jimmies have to do with delirium tremens and the heebie - jeebies — the “ trivial ” meaning of jim - jam does not seem to have moved over to jimmies . second , at no point have the candy sprinkles been called jim - jams , a link in the etymological chain one would expect if the one were a shortening of the other . <PARA> throwing yet another log on the fire , a 1993 boston globe item stated that “ the origin of the name is apparently unknown , but we found this hard - to - take - too - seriously reference in an old file : an ( unnamed ) ice cream maker claims that in 1901 constance bartlett of pottstown , pennsylvania , after grating chocolate over ice cream for her son ’ s birthday , reportedly told other children they couldn ’ t eat them because ‘ they ’ re jimmy ’ s .'” <PARA> sometimes words just sneak into a language without anyone ’ s knowing , years after the fact , how that process came about . yet no matter how jimmies became part of common parlance ( as with many other terms , its origin may ultimately prove untraceable ), no substantive evidence demonstrates anything denigrative of african - americans was tied to the origin of the name : <PARA> it may be the case that among those who refer to dark brown or chocolate sprinkles as “ jimmies ” and other colors simply as “ sprinkles ,” someone simply assumed a potentially racist connection was at work and retroactively invented an explanation for it .
false	in november 2018 , a purported photograph of a young barack obama began making its way around social media , attached to the claim that it pictured the former president during his college years with saudi prince al - waleed bin talal : <PARA> no evidence ( beyond a vague resemblance ) suggests that this photograph features prince al - waleed bin talal . furthermore , an investigation into the gestation of this conspiracy theory shows that it was pulled from thin air . <PARA> this photograph doesn ’ t appear to have any official origin trail . we could not find it archived by news photo outlets such as getty images or the associated press , nor could we locate it any galleries covering barack obama ’ s college years . the earliest posting of this image ( sans black arrow ) that we could uncover came from a march 2013 reddit discussion about a different picture of barack obama ’ s mother . reddit user “ einmalistkeinmal ” claimed to have received the photograph circa 2008 and stated it was taken by a friend ’ s drug dealer ’ s father who used to be friends with obama “ back in the day ”: <PARA> while this third - hand information is certainly not enough to confirm the context of this photograph ( or even document that the man in the white shirt is truly barack obama ), it does demonstrate that this photograph predates the “ prince al - waleed bin talal ” claim by several years and was originally shared with a rather harmless caption . ( we reached out to “ einmalistkeinmal ” for more information about the photograph but have yet to hear back .) <PARA> this unverified image of barack obama in college received little attention over the next few years , but in september 2018 a “ qanon ” conspiracy theorist shared a version which obscured one man ’ s face and offered the picture to followers with the insinuation that it indicated barack obama was homosexual : <PARA> a number of twitter users chimed in to guess the identity of the “ masked ” man . while most pushed the idea that the faceless man was actually michelle obama ( a certain sect of the population maintains , without evidence , that the former first lady was once a man ), others posited that it showed members of the muslim brotherhood , a mysteriously murdered boyfriend , or “ christine blasey ford ’ s uncle .” <PARA> the q community , 4chan , and the pro - donald trump section of reddit r / the_donald , however , started to push the rumor that this image featured saudi prince al - waleed bin talal . why ? most likely to support a small portion of the ever - expanding “ q ” conspiracy theory which holds that bin talal paid for barack obama to attend harvard law school . <PARA> no evidence has been presented to show that this person is truly prince al - waleed bin talal . furthermore , a side - by - side comparison of the man in the viral photograph ( left ) and bin talal from 1996 ( right ) show that the two men don ’ t bear much of a resemblance . particularly , al - waleed bin talal has a much lighter complexion than his mysterious counterpart and a mole on his right cheek that the “ mystery ” man does not share : <PARA> we have not been able to positively identify the people in this photograph . it is likely , however , that if this image hasn ’ t been doctored , it simply captures barack obama with one of his pakistani friends from his days at occidental college . obama ’ s freshman roommate was a pakistani man named imad husain , and the former president quickly became friends with two other pakistanis , mohammed hasan chandoo and wahid hamid .

true	on 5 december 2018 , the seattle times published an article whose terrifying headline ensured its own virality : “ rare brain - eating amoebas killed seattle woman who rinsed her sinuses with tap water . doctor warns this could happen again .” <PARA> sadly for those who visited this page hoping to find that the reporting was exaggerated or made - up , this really happened . though her anonymity was maintained , the story of a 69 - year - old seattle woman who used tap water in her neti pot for over a year and then died from a balamuthia mandrillaris brain infection was documented in a 20 september 2018 case study published in the international journal of infectious diseases : <PARA> one year before developing the brain infection , the authors reported , the woman developed a chronic sinus infection whose symptoms were not relieved by medication . she turned to using a neti pot to rinse her sinuses , but instead of using sterile or saline water as directed , she used tap water filtered with a brita system . after a month of this practice , and without any relief of her sinus symptoms , “ she developed a quarter - sized , red raised rash on the right side of the bridge of her nose and raw red skin at the nasal opening .” though several misdiagnoses followed , no doctor correctly recognized the rash as a symptom of an amoebic infection . <PARA> the report stated that a year after that initial rash developed , the woman developed a seizure that required hospitalization . at that time , the doctors identified a lesion on the right side of the brain which they decided to biopsy . some 19 days later , after a continued decline in the patient ’ s health , scientists from johns hopkins university suggested the possibility that the cause of her malady was an amoebic infection , and the centers for disease control rushed a novel drug for her treatment . unfortunately , they were unable to halt the progression of the disease , and the patient ’ s family made the decision to remove her from life support . <PARA> an autopsy determined the cause of death to be granulomatous amebic encephalitis ( gae ), which the cdc defines as “ a serious infection of the brain and spinal cord that typically occurs in persons with a compromised immune system .” in this case , the causative agent was an extremely rare amoeba named balamuthia mandrillaris , one of three forms of amoeba known to be capable of infecting and consuming the human brain . <PARA> amoebas are a broad group of taxonomically mixed unicellular organisms that consume surrounding cellular material through absorption , and that express an ability to take on a variety of shapes . several different species are associated with disease , most notably naegleria fowleri , commonly known as the “ brain - eating amoeba ” that can cause a different kind of brain infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis ( pam ). <PARA> balamuthia mandrillaris was discovered in 1986 in the brain of a mandrill monkey during an autopsy at the san diego zoo and is now recognized to be a cause of gae in both humans , several primates , and other animals , with an estimated 200 cases of human infection ever documented . the amoebae are ubiquitous in soil and groundwater although their presence is not expected in city - treated water , according to liz coleman , a spokeswoman for the environmental public health division of washington state ’ s department of health , quoted in the seattle times ’ reporting . <PARA> merely ingesting the thing will not lead to health problems , but in rare cases ( usually instances involving people with weakened immune systems , or those who are young or old ), the organisms can infect a host through skin breakage or via the respiratory system . if they infect the central nervous system , they “ ingest bits and pieces of host tissue [ and produce ] enzymes that degrade the tissue .” <PARA> nasal irrigation involves rinsing one ’ s sinus cavity with distilled or sterile water ( or water that has been filtered to remove potentially infectious organisms ), and one such method of water delivery is a neti pot . the need for sterility is explicitly stated due to the ( extremely small ) risk posed by another amoeba , naegleria fowleri , and it is the reason the fda requires ( in the absence of sterile water ) a specific kind of filter capable of removing the amoeba and similarly - sized organisms from water before it is pushed through fragile sinus tissue . <PARA> while the authors of this case report could not state with absolute certainty that the neti pot was to blame , it is far and away the most likely explanation given the fact that the patient had been rinsing her sinuses with tap water regularly for an extended period of time : <PARA> other routes of exposure are possible , according to a 2013 review of amoebic infections : <PARA> although the water used in the neti pot likely caused this infection , dr . cynthia maree , a co -

true	russian - born american author ayn rand , who is best known for her didactic novels championing capitalism and individualism , the fountainhead and atlas shrugged , also wrote several philosophical works , essays , lectures , and newsletters elaborating on her ethos of “ objectivism .” <PARA> in all these writings , rand defended the rights of individual freedom and ownership of property , which she regarded as absolute and inviolable , against every encroachment of “ collectivism ,” broadly defined as the subjugation of the individual to a group . in her book of essays capitalism : the unknown ideal , she wrote : <PARA> in terms of the individual ’ s relationship to the state ( whose only valid reason for existing , she claimed , is to defend the safety and rights of its citizens ), rand believed that all taxation should be strictly voluntary . she therefore regarded every instance of the involuntary appropriation or redistribution of wealth as a violation of the rights of the individuals from whom money is taken — i . e ., theft : <PARA> unsurprisingly , then , the so - called “ welfare state ,” with its systematic redistribution of wealth as social entitlements , was rand ’ s bogeyman of choice . economist alan greenspan , former federal reserve chairman and an early espouser of rand ’ s laissez - faire philosophy , wrote : <PARA> although social security is usually framed as retirement insurance ( pay in while you ’ re working , then withdraw savings upon retirement ), a 2014 article on the ayn rand institute web site argues that it is a form of welfare : <PARA> in 2010 , journalist and former media rep for the ayn rand institute scott mcconnell compiled an oral history of rand in which evva pryor , who worked as a consultant to the law firm that represented rand , admitted to helping the aging author and her husband apply for and receive social security benefits in the mid - 1970s . <PARA> mcconnell ’ s book , “ 100 voices : an oral history of ayn rand ” comprised scores of transcribed interviews with scores of rand ’ s friends , family members , and associates . mcconnell interviewed pryor in 1998 , 16 years after rand ’ s death . <PARA> an archivist for the ayn rand institute told us that although most of rand ’ s financial records were destroyed at the time of her death and they have no physical evidence of her receiving social security distributions , evva pryor ’ s testimony was backed up by rand ’ s secretary , cynthia peikoff , who helped the author with her finances during the last two years of her life and reported seeing social security checks . <PARA> the archivist also told us that proof that rand paid into the social security system earlier in life exists in the form of an application for a social security card , the card itself , and legal correspondence from the mid - 1940s inquiring about a refund of social security withholdings . <PARA> in 2010 , freelance writer patia stephens reported obtaining a social security administration record via foia request showing that ayn rand collected a total of $ 11 , 002 in social security payments between 1974 and her death in 1982 ( her husband , frank o ’ connor , also collected benefits until his death ). <PARA> upon the release of the book containing pryor ’ s testimony , critics of ayn rand ’ s uncompromising libertarian ethos wasted no time pointing out the apparent inconsistency and hypocrisy of her acceptance of government payments . in an op - ed titled “ ayn rand railed against government benefits , but grabbed social security and medicare when she needed them ,” alternet ’ s joshua holland wrote : <PARA> center for the study of the american dream founding director michael ford wrote : <PARA> point acknowledged . yet the accusation of hypocrisy rests on an assumption that nowhere in rand ’ s vast oeuvre had she ever made a case for accepting money from the government . however , she did , in fact , make such a case in a 1966 essay , “ the question of scholarships .” <PARA> it is morally defensible for those who decry publicly - funded scholarships , social security benefits , and unemployment insurance to turn around and accept them , rand argued , because the government had taken money from them by force ( via taxes ). there ’ s only one catch : the recipient must regard the receipt of said benefits as restitution , not a social entitlement . <PARA> “ those who advocate public scholarships [ or social security benefits ] have no right to them ; those who oppose them have ,” rand wrote . in fact , she seemed to see it as something approaching the duty of those opposed to the redistribution of wealth to accept such payments : <PARA> ayn rand institute chief content officer onkar ghate addressed the apparent paradox of rand ’ s position in a 2014 article , “ the myth about ayn rand and social security ”: <PARA> the flaw in this argument is that it only adds up if you accept rand ’ s characterization of involuntary taxation as “ legalized plunder ” and her assertion that it confers upon those who object to it on principle ( and , by some interpretations , only those who object to it on principle ) the right to financial restitution . <PARA> flawed or not , however , the fact that she articulated the position puts paid to the charge that her acceptance of social security benefits in later life was hypocritical . on her own terms , it was not .

false	origins : at the height of the french - bashing that spread throughout the u . s . in february 2003 as a reaction to the two countries ’ disagreements over the propriety of taking military action against iraq , a few u . s . congressmen started grumbling about implementing some symbolic economic sanctions against france . among the items mentioned were imposing new health standards on bottled drinking water imported from <PARA> france and requiring warning labels on french wines clarified with bovine ’ s blood . these two items became jumbled in the public ’ s mind and emerged as the claim that evian drinking water is “ filtered with cow ’ s blood .” <PARA> one of the actions proposed to “ punish ” france was passing legislation which would impose new and additional health standards on drinking water exported to the u . s . such an action would obviously increase the costs to ( and thereby decrease the profits of ) foreign companies who market drinking water in the u . s ., and france , as the largest exporter of drinking water to the united states ( 65 million gallons in 2001 ) would be hurt most of all . the association of this story with evian is obvious : evian is the most well - known brand of natural mineral water in the u . s ., and most of the newspaper accounts of this story specifically mentioned evian as an example of “ popular french waters .” <PARA> but “ cow ’ s blood ” has nothing to do with evian ( or any other brand of drinking water ); that association came from another aspect of the same story proposing that the u . s . slap “ bright orange warning labels ” on french wine clarified with bovine ’ s blood . the intent of such legislation would be to frighten americans away from buying french wines by calling their attention to a practice few of them were aware of : <PARA> the underlying issue involves a wine - making trick called “ fining ,” in which a protein is mixed into wine in vats or barrels to attract colloidal materials that could make the wine cloudy or hazy . these proteins fall to the bottom of the vats and the wine is siphoned away from them ; in theory , at least , none of the fining material remains in the clarified wine . traditional fining agents include a variety of odd substances , including isinglass ( made from fish bladders ), egg whites and , in some parts of the rhone valley in france , dried oxblood or blood albumen . <PARA> the mention of requiring bright orange warning labels on french wines was largely a bogus issue , as the use of bovine ’ s blood as fining agent was already a dying practice before it was banned outright by the eec back in 1997 : <PARA> these old - fashioned practices are somewhat dying out in any case ; most modern wineries , including virtually all larger wineries , now pass wine through bentonite ( clay ) filters rather than using organic finings . <PARA> because of legitimate concerns about the epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( bse ), popularly called “ mad cow disease ,” which became epidemic among cattle in britain during the 1990s and which has been associated with the human brain disorder creutzfeldt - jakob disease , the european economic community banned the use of oxblood for wine fining in 1997 . <PARA> because of legitimate concerns about the epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( bse ), popularly called “ mad cow disease ,” which became epidemic among cattle in britain during the 1990s and which has been associated with the human brain disorder creutzfeldt - jakob disease , the european economic community banned the use of oxblood for wine fining in 1997 . <PARA> the intent of the proposed legislation was presumably to require warning labels on the few french wines produced using bovine ’ s blood as a clarifier before the 1997 eec ban went into effect , since bottled wine is typically sold for many years beyond its production date . <PARA> nothing came of these murmured proposals , although it appears that angry legislators may have achieved one of their intended results by a completely unintended route : people are now avoiding evian because they believe it to be “ filtered with cow ’ s blood .”

( note that the woman in the story is identified as being a former model and a cheerleader , both popular stereotypes for legends involving sexuality and foolish actions resulting from a lack of intelligence . one can only wonder why the author of the “ article ” failed to describe the woman as “ blonde ” as well .) jokes about women eating ( rather than applying ) vaginal gel have been around for years ( a similar one was told at canada ’ s 1994 reform party convention , for example ), as have their counterparts ( i . e ., tales of women who became pregnant after vaginally applying “ regular ” jelly instead of spermicidal gels ). for example : <PARA> [ petras , 1998 ] <PARA> a woman in west africa stored her contraceptive gel in the refrigerator because she was afraid that in the high heat prevailing in the tropical region it would melt . <PARA> one night , while giving a formal dinner party , she watched as the cook brought out the dessert of the evening . it was a large sherry trifle with cream , cherries , nuts — and topped off with a lovely glaze of contraceptive gel . <PARA> a woman in west africa stored her contraceptive gel in the refrigerator because she was afraid that in the high heat prevailing in the tropical region it would melt . <PARA> one night , while giving a formal dinner party , she watched as the cook brought out the dessert of the evening . it was a large sherry trifle with cream , cherries , nuts — and topped off with a lovely glaze of contraceptive gel . <PARA> another example of this legend type are the anecdotes about men in rural areas or lesser - developed countries who are shown how to apply condoms by a health worker who demonstrates the technique on a banana or broomstick handle : they then take the instruction <PARA> literally and place condoms over bananas or broomsticks every time they engage in sex . this isn ’ t to say that someone , somewhere hasn ’ t ever mistakenly eaten spermicidal jelly . people do some incredibly foolish things with medical products , no matter how specific the instructions on the packaging may be . but a woman suing a pharmacy because she didn ’ t read the instructions on an over - the - counter contraceptive and mistook it for a food product ? no way . <PARA> the circulation of this legend by the media in the form cited above can no doubt be attributed to the undue amount of credibility afforded to newspaper articles ( or items purporting to be newspaper articles ), and the public ’ s sense of moral outrage being stirred up by yet more seemingly frivolous litigation initiated by persons whose losses were caused by a lack of basic common sense ( much like the recent spate of lawsuits against restaurants over burns caused by people who spilled hot coffee on themselves ). a brief mention of the legend ( related as a “ true story ”) was made in an article about medication errors that appeared in the charleston post and courier in january 1997 , both rush limbaugh and jay leno reported this item as a real incident on their shows ( on 6 june 1997 and 27 june 1997 , respectively ), and ann landers ran this as an example of a real “ crazy lawsuit ” in her column of 5 october 1997 . <PARA> also told in :

true	origins : although we dread the gory industrial accidents that leave their victims dead or result in the loss of a limb ( or more ), other types of on - the - job injuries can strike us as far more horrific . one such accident took place on 15 august 2003 , when ron hunt , a truckee , california , construction worker , landed face - first on a large drill <PARA> hunt was working in the tahoe donner subdivision in truckee , standing atop a six - foot ladder while drilling over his head , when he gave the drill an extra push to bore a hole . as he felt the ladder begin to wobble out from under him , he tried tossing his power drill aside ( a standard practice in the construction industry , intended to prevent workers from injuring themselves attempting to regain grips on out - of - control power tools ) before falling to the ground . unfortunately , he wasn ’ t able to throw the drill far enough away , and he landed upon it face - first . the 18 - inch - long , 1 . 5 - inch diameter chip auger drill bit pierced hunt ’ s right eye and exited through the side of his skull . as hunt described the mishap : <PARA> by the time i was falling , and i let the drill go down , i was already on top of it . the drill was facing up but it was off . when the drill hit , it just exploded my eye . it skewered me . i ran my hands up the drill bit , up to my eye , and put my other hand in the back of my head and felt it coming through the back of my head , and that ’ s where pretty much the shock set in . the first thing i thought was ‘ am i going to die ?’ i knew it was serious . i was scared . i didn ’ t know if it was in my brain or not . <PARA> the only other worker on the site that morning , forrest keating , heard hunt call for help and rushed to assist him : <PARA> the first thing i saw was this drill sticking out about 6 inches from the back of his head and 6 inches out the front . it was a trip , like something out of a horror movie . i was amazed he was still alive . <PARA> keating removed his shirt and attempted to stem the flow of blood gushing from hunt ’ s eye by wrapping the shirt around the drill . he then ran <PARA> 300 yards to a nearby house to summon medical help , and when paramedics arrived they released the body of the drill from the bit and loaded hunt onto a gurney . hunt ( conscious throughout his ordeal ) was then flown by helicopter to washoe medical center in reno , nevada , where doctors pondered their options for treating the bizarre injury . miraculously , although the drill bit tunneled between hunt ’ s scalp and his skull as it came out of the side of his head , it pushed his brain aside rather than pushing into it , sparing him from death , brain damage , or paralysis . <PARA> dr . paul ludlow , an ear , nose and throat specialist who was the facial trauma physician on call that morning , initially intended to cut off the drill bit but eventually decided that the best approach was to , in effect , unscrew it from hunt ’ s head : <PARA> we had to either cut down on it , which meant making a rather long incision through a lot of muscle , or just unscrew it – twist it all the way through and out . we would have cut it off , but after a few minutes of drilling , we noticed that it was loose . and so we just put down our blade and twisted the bit . <PARA> hunt had sufficiently recovered from his injuries by early september to appear on national television programs such as cnn news and abc ’ s “ good morning america .” although he was truly fortunate not to have suffered more severe injuries ( or damage to his motor or speech skills ), he came away from the accident far from unscathed : besides suffering a fractured skull ( which required a second operation to insert two titanium plates to reinforce the fractured bone ), he lost an eye and now faces hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills and rehabilitation costs . according to news accounts , hunt is not covered by state compensation for on - the - job injuries , and he was a self - employed worker with no medical insurance . <PARA> injuries of this type always call to mind the case of phineas gage , who in 1848 survived an accident which blew a 3 - foot , 7 - inch tamping iron under a cheek bone and completely out through the top of his head . although gage lived on for almost another dozen years , he suffered dramatic changes in personality and was subject to epileptic seizures in his final months .

false	a california newspaper debunked an attempt by donald trump to criticize pro football players protesting extrajudicial killings by police by illustrating the real context behind a photograph he shared via his twitter account . <PARA> on 4 january 2018 , the san diego union - tribune highlighted the following tweet from the president : <PARA> the photograph showed a woman lying down with an infant near a headstone . trump ’ s tweet linked to one by another user , corey jones , who posted the image with the caption , “ this is why we stand ”: <PARA> jones failed to mention that former san francisco 49er quarterback colin kaepernick , who originated the protest prior to the 2016 regular season , began “ taking a knee ” after consulting with an army special forces veteran , nate boyer . <PARA> further , the union - tribune confirmed that it first published the photograph of jenn budenz at the grave of her husband , marine corps maj . andrew budenz , in 2014 . but it also noted that contrary to jones ’ suggestion , the major was not killed in action ; he actually died in september 2013 in a motorcycle accident . <PARA> photographer hayne palmour iv , who captured the images of jenn budenz and the couple ’ s young son a . j . for the newspaper , said of the president ’ s comment :
mixture	on 18 april 2018 , the mutilated bodies of two young african - american men , alize ramon smith and jarron keonte moreland , were found in a pond near moore , oklahoma , where they had had been reported missing by relatives a few days earlier . <PARA> police said the victims were shot by the younger of two brothers , both white , who had arranged to meet with them in a parking lot to complete a firearms sale initiated on craigslist . the accused killers , 16 - year - old brett boettler and his brother , kevin don garcia - boettler , 22 , then took the bodies to their mother ’ s house and , with the help of her boyfriend , johnny barker ( also white ), dismembered them and dumped the weighted remains in a nearby body of water . the brothers , barker , and crystal boettler were arrested and charged with first - and second - degree murder , desecration of human corpses , and illegal possession of a firearm , among other crimes . <PARA> according to newsone . com , smith and moreland were the victims of a “ modern lynching ” that has gone largely unreported in the mainstream media — despite a recent controversy surrounding the use of that term to describe the public backlash against black male entertainers accused of sexual misconduct : <PARA> a similarly - focused web site , the root , also provided aggregated coverage of the incident , referring to it as “ lynching 2 . 0 .” the article paid particular attention to the gruesome details surrounding the disposal of the victims ’ bodies . <PARA> in statements to the press , smith ’ s mother , destiny , described the murder of her son as a “ hate crime ,” but at least one law enforcement official told oklahoma city ’ s news 9 that that does not appear to be the case : <PARA> were there a demonstrable racial motive behind the attack and / or mistreatment of the victim ’ s remains it would likely be prosecutable as a hate crime , but would still fall short of qualifying as a lynching , says karlos hill , interim director of african american studies at the university of oklahoma . <PARA> “ calling it a lynching is going too far ,” hill , author of the 2016 volume beyond the rope : the impact of lynching on black culture and memory ( cambridge university press , 2016 ), explained to us in a phone interview : <PARA> unlike the murders of smith and moreland , which were committed inside a parked van unseen by eyewitnesses , historical lynchings were communal events that invariably took place in public , he said : <PARA> in describing the killings as a “ lynching ,” both the root and news one echoed sentiments that had already been spreading for at least a week on social media . writer and twitter personality shaun king tweeted the following on 26 april , for example : <PARA> writer george m . johnson tweeted a similar take on 1 may : <PARA> the claim that the incident was ignored by the mainstream media is an overstatement , though not entirely unfounded . besides being reported ( as one would expect ) in local and regional news venues , the story did get national coverage by sources including newsweek , associated press , the new york daily news , and buzzfeed . but it wasn ’ t covered by cnn , msnbc , or other major networks . the implication that it should have been seems to follow from the judgment that the crime was a racially - motivated lynching as opposed to a mere homicide . <PARA> the use of the word “ lynching ” in this context is questionable , at best . despite vague similarities between the oklahoma incident and historical lynchings , the comparison strays from the generally accepted definition of the term . the merriam - webster dictionary defines it thus , for example : <PARA> in the context of race relations in america , it refers more specifically to vigilante - style public executions of black americans accused of racial transgressions by white mobs , mainly in the deep south , between the end of the civil war and the end of the jim crow era of racial segregation in the 1950s . but despite the fact that the oklahoma victims were black and all four of the accused perpetrators were white , it ’ s a stretch to characterize the latter as a “ mob ” and the killings as a “ public execution .” nor , based on the information shared by police thus far , are there solid reasons to presume that race was a primary motivation in the attack . <PARA> ethnicity is relevant to determining whether a lynching took place , according to karlos hill , but even if evidence comes to light that the 2018 oklahoma killings constituted a hate crime , that — in and of itself — would not make it a lynching . “ there ’ s a difference between a racially motivated murder and a lynching ,” he said . <PARA> based on the information shared by police thus far , it is not a given that the incident fits into either category .
false	one common tactic used by hate - baiting fake news web sites is to use a photograph ( often a mugshot ) of a real person and create a story around it . on 29 january 2018 , for instance , the web site world news daily report used an image of an obese woman to illustrate a fake news story about a rape attempt by an escaped hippopotamus at a paris zoo : <PARA> there is no truth to this story . <PARA> the world news daily report is a well - known purveyor of fake news with has a long history of publishing misinformation and an apparent fascination with bestiality . in addition to this fake news story of a hippo attempting to rape a woman , they ’ ve previously published stories about zookeepers attempting to molest gorillas , a zookeeper attempting to rape an alligator , an octopus sexually assaulting a zoo employee , and a “ koala brothel ” in australia . <PARA> the web site carries a disclaimer stating that all of its content is “ satirical ” in nature : <PARA> the woman pictured in this story is vilma soltesz , who passed away in 2012 after she was reportedly denied several flights back to the united states from hungary due to her weight : <PARA> a hippo escaped from a zoo in tbilisi , georgia , in june 2015 after a massive flood . a number of animals escaped and were subsequently put down : <PARA> the pictured hippo , named beggi , appears to have survived the ordeal .

false	as talk of impeachment flooded the internet in september 2019 , we came across two rumors concerning the impact of the impeachment process on president donald trump ’ s reelection opportunities . <PARA> the first held that a president who was impeached by the house , but not convicted by the senate , could run for office two more times because the failed impeachment would nullify the first term . the second posited that if the house votes to impeach a president , but the senate doesn ’ t convict and remove the person from office , the president is barred from running for office again . <PARA> we ’ ll take a look at each of those theories below . but first , a quick look at how the impeachment process works . people often use the word “ impeachment ” when referring to the removal of a president from office . but that ’ s not exactly how it works . the house of representatives has the “ sole power of impeachment ,” as stated in article i , section 2 , clause 5 of the u . s . constitution . but it is up to the senate to convict and remove a president from office . in this way , “ impeachment ” is roughly akin to bringing formal charges against an individual . it is then up to the senate to convict the individual on those charges . <PARA> the aforementioned theories both deal with the gray area between impeachment and conviction . in other words , what happens if the president is impeached by the house of representatives but is not convicted by the senate ? <PARA> theory 1 : if a president is impeached by the house but not convicted by the senate , the first presidential term is nullified and the president may run for election two more times . <PARA> false : this theory has been posited by a few social media users , but it reached a larger audience when it was shared by pizzagate conspiracy theorist jack posobiec : <PARA> the tweet reads : “ these democrats don ’ t realize that if they impeach trump and the senate doesn ’ t confirm it then it nullifies trump ’ s first term and he gets to run two more times . read the constitution , people .” <PARA> this is not how impeachment works . <PARA> before we get to what the constitution says about impeachment , we can get a glimpse of the hypothetical scenario posited in this tweet by taking a quick look at our country ’ s recent history . <PARA> president bill clinton was impeached by the house of representatives on dec . 19 , 1998 . however , clinton was not convicted by the senate . we searched news reports from the time and found no serious reporters , historians , or politicians arguing that the senate ’ s failure to convict clinton literally nullified the president ’ s previous term and gave him the opportunity to run for office again . <PARA> the associated press reported on feb . 12 , 1999 : <PARA> the process for impeachment is laid out in article i and article ii of the u . s . constitution . this text says nothing about a president ’ s term being “ nullified ” by an impeachment proceeding . furthermore , the 22nd amendment of the constitution explicitly states that “ no person shall be elected to the office of the president more than twice .” <PARA> doug pennington , director of communication for the constitutional accountability center , told us in an email that posobiec ’ s statement was false : <PARA> theory 2 : a president is barred from seeking a second term once impeached . <PARA> mostly false : a number of social media users seem to be under the impression that trump would not be able to seek reelection if the house of representatives impeaches him . one twitter user , for instance , wrote : “ if he gets impeached he won ’ t be able to run in the next election like he plans to . it would guarantee that we can ’ t have 4 more years under his leadership .” <PARA> but that isn ’ t the case . a president who is impeached by the house but is not convicted by the senate could still run for reelection . <PARA> pennington told us : “ nothing in the constitution ’ s language on impeachment prevents a president impeached but not convicted from running for a second of a two - term maximum .” <PARA> in fact , before house speaker nancy pelosi announced an official impeachment inquiry into trump in september 2019 , political pundits noted that a “ failed ” impeachment could help trump ’ s reelection efforts . <PARA> an opinion piece in the hill noted : <PARA> however , a bit of truth is offered here . the constitution explains the country has two penalties for impeachment : removal from office and disqualification “ to hold and enjoy any office of honor , trust or profit under the united states .” if a president is impeached by the house of representatives , the senate could convict , remove the president from office , and disqualify the person from holding future office . <PARA> this scenario , however , falls into some gray area because it has never been tested at the presidential level . it is possible that the senate could take two separate votes , one on removal from office and one on disqualification from future office , which could result in a president ’ s removal from office but provide an opportunity to seek reelection . it ’ s also theoretically possible that a president who has been impeached , convicted , removed , and disqualified , could seek office at a lower level of government . <PARA> we asked pennington about the possibility of a president seeking reelection after the house has impeached and the senate convicted the person . he told us : <PARA> to sum up : although a president is impeached by the house of representatives , the repercussions of this legal process don ’ t come to fruition until the senate votes to convict the president . <PARA> if that happens , the senate can vote to remove the president from office and disqualify the person from holding future office . if the senate does not convict , the president will not be removed from office , nor will the person be prevented from seeking reelection ( if he / she has not already reached the two - term limit ). <PARA> nowhere in the constitution , however , does it state that a failed impeachment process would “ nullify ” a presidential term and allow a president to seek extra time in office .
false	you bet your life was the post - world war ii vehicle that provided groucho marx with a career apart from his brothers and introduced him to a generation of viewers too young to remember him from his stage or film work . the interview - quiz show , featuring the famous $ 100 bonus paid to any contestant who said the “ secret word ” ( displayed on a cartoonish stuffed duck that dropped from above if a contestant uttered the word of the day ) debuted on radio in 1947 , aired on both radio and television through 1960 , and continued on television only for its final season in 1960 - 61 — all in all , an amazing fourteen - year run for a quiz show with a tiny budget , a plain set , and a small jackpot ( even by 1950s standards ). <PARA> although you bet your life was structured to make it appear as though every show was completely ad - libbed by groucho ( who issued a steady stream of impromptu questions , off - the - cuff remarks , and cutting put - downs to contestants he had met only moments earlier ), a good deal of preparation went into each episode . potential contestants were selected and interviewed in advance , scripts for each week ’ s show were prepared by writers and reviewed by groucho , and the comedian used a mechanical teleprompter to read his lines during the recording of the program . ( in early telecasts of you bet your life , groucho can be seen reading off sheets of paper propped up in front of him on something resembling a music stand .) it was true , however , that groucho didn ’ t actually meet the contestants until they walked onstage , and he certainly had plenty of latitude to depart from the prepared gags and questions ( as did the contestants ), with the result that much of the show ’ s banter was indeed improvised on the spot . about a hour ’ s worth of material was recorded for each half hour program so that flubs , uninteresting segments , and any troublesome or offensive remarks by groucho could be edited out . <PARA> the most notable remark of groucho ’ s you bet your life years , that one that has gone down in legend as one of pop culture ’ s most notorious comeback quips , supposedly occurred when grouch was interviewing a mrs . story , a contestant with a remarkably large number of children ( a number that varies anywhere from 10 to 21 in different tellings of the legend ): <PARA> but did groucho really say this , or is it a remark that ( like so many other infamous quips ) originated elsewhere and was later attributed to the notable figure deemed most likely to have said it ? <PARA> since you bet your life was taped in advance , heavily edited , and not aired live , this remark ( if it truly occurred ) would certainly have been cut from the finished program as too offensive for the standards of the times ; so we can state definitively that ( claims to the contrary notwithstanding ) nobody ever actually heard it broadcast . if groucho had really made this quip , the only people who would have heard it would have been the people present during the recording of the program ( i . e ., the cast , crew , contestants , and studio audience ). <PARA> so , did groucho in fact utter this risqué remark , even if his bon mot never made it onto the airwaves ? the one person who would undoubtedly know the truth is groucho himself , and he maintained in a 1972 interview with roger ebert for esquire magazine that he never said it : <PARA> this debate really should end here , based on a complete lack of evidence that groucho ever said any such thing , coupled with his unequivocal statement affirming that he did not ( and groucho had no motive to disclaim one of the most famous lines associated with his celebrity if he really had said it ). instead , the legend persists in large part because misinformation about it is propagated over and over . take , for example , the following account , presented as a first - person telling in a 1976 book often touted as a groucho marx autobiography , the secret word is groucho : <PARA> but even though groucho is credited as the primary author of the secret word is groucho , it isn ’ t really an “ autobiography .” the book was actually put together in the waning years of the comedian ’ s life by freelance writer hector arce , who ostensibly obtained input from groucho ; and it ’ s unlikely that groucho ’ s declining health and memory allowed him to contribute much ( if anything ) to the finished work , leaving arce to rely on secondary sources . arce consulted various personnel associated with you bet your life in producing the book ; almost certainly one ( or more ) of those people proffered the “ cigar ” story as true to arce , who rewrote it in groucho ’ s voice and inserted it into the book , unaware that his subject had denied it just a few years previously . arce ’ s account doesn ’ t sound like groucho ’ s speaking or writing style at all , and it presents a groucho who has suddenly “ remembered ” details he was previously unfamiliar with in his esquire few years earlier ( i . e ., he ’ s corrected the gender of the person he was addressing from male to female , he now recalls the contestant ’ s name , and he ’ s fixed the wording of the remark from “ i smoke a cigar , but i take it out of my mouth occasionally ” to the pithier “ i love my cigar too , but i take it out of my mouth once in a while ”). while the 1972 esquire interview in which groucho discussed this quip unideniably contained groucho ’ s own words , the same can ’ t be said for what was presented in arce ’ s book . <PARA> the secret word is groucho account quoted above also has groucho asserting that the purported exchange with mrs . story was “ clipped out by dwan , the house censor .” groucho of course would have known that robert dwan was not a “ house censor ”; he was one of the producers who worked on you bet your life for its entire run , staging the weekly performances and supervising the editing of each episode for broadcast . in his own book about the program ( as long as they ’ re laughing : groucho marx and you bet your life ), dwan wrote : <PARA> this account is even more curious : robert dwan , the man who was onstage for every performance of you bet your life and who supervised the editing of the show , didn ’ t remember hearing groucho make such a remark , yet he came to “ believe ” the legend was real because someone else told him so many years after the fact . and although dwan noted that he consulted “ 20 volumes of the original scripts ” and a “ collection of acetate recordings of the unedited performances and tapes of the edited broadcasts ” and four reels of 16mm film consisting of “ the funniest and most audacious of the sequences which we were required to delete from the broadcasts as being unsuitable for viewing in the 1950s ” in the preparation of his book , he made nary a mention of turning up anything supporting the “ cigar ” story . <PARA> steve stoliar , who worked as a secretary in groucho ’ s household during the last few years of the comedian ’ s life , also made an affirmative case for this legend in his 1996 book , raised eyebrows : my years inside groucho ’ s house : <PARA> although the imagined dialogue between groucho and the female contestant is lifted directly from the secret word is groucho , this account does at least introduce some detail to the story ( e . g ., a specific number of children , the hometown of the contestants , the father ’ s occupation , the year of the interview ) indicating actual research rather than mere repetition of legend . as we ’ ll see shortly , however , some of this detail is inaccurate . <PARA> the most recent presentation of the “ cigar ” legend we ’ re aware of is the background booklet enclosed with the 2003 dvd release you bet your life : the lost episodes ( a collection of some of the show ’ s preserved tv episodes ), which contained the following information about an audio bonus feature included on one of the discs : <PARA> ( note that the imagined dialogue between groucho and mrs . story is lifted directly from the book the secret word is groucho , another indication that it came from someone associated with the you bet your life program and not groucho himself .) <PARA> it is true that marion and charlotte story of bakersfield , california , the parents of twenty children , were once featured as contestants on you bet your life . according to announcer george fenneman ’ s introduction , mr . and mrs . story were selected to participate because the producers thought it would be interesting to go through the audience and find the couple with the largest number of offspring for groucho to interview , and as the parents of twenty children ( not nineteen , as stated in raised eyebrows ), mr . and mrs . story qualified for that honor . ( since you bet your life was a well - planned show that interviewed and prepped its contestants in advance , mr . and mrs . story likely appeared on the program by invitation and were not merely present in the audience by happenstance , with george fenneman ’ s introduction of them probably stretching the truth a little to create an exaggerated sense of spontaneity for the listening audience .) it is also true that this interview took place during you bet your life ‘ s days as a radio - only program ( it didn ’ t begin airing on television in addition to radio until october 1950 ); so even if the “ cigar ” quip had sprung from this encounter , anyone who now claims to have seen groucho make the remark on television is clearly mistaken . <PARA> as usual , however , the dvd booklet ’ s account is rife with misinformation . a complete audio recording of ( the broadcast portions of ) marion and charlotte story ’ s appearance on you bet your life does indeed exist ( and is linked below ). moreover , that recording couldn ’ t possibly date from 17 november 1947 , as claimed , because groucho can be heard making promotional references to desoto - plymouth , who did not become sponsors of you bet your life until partway through the 1949 - 50 season . ( external evidence indicates this recording actually dates from the broadcast of 11 january 1950 , the first show aired after desoto - plymouth took over sponsorship of you bet your life from elgin - american .) <PARA> what do we find in this recording ? it does not include anything like the infamous “ cigar ” quip , groucho ’ s only mention of stogies coming when he inquires of mr . story , “ with each new kid , do you go around passing out cigars ?” (“ i stopped at about a dozen ,” mr . story responds .) and for those who would claim that the “ cigar ” remark was indeed uttered by groucho but excised from the aired version of the show , we note that none of the claimed dialogue ancillary to that remark is present in the recording , either : groucho does not ask charlotte story why she has so many children , neither mr . nor mrs . story professes to thinking that having children is “ our purpose here on earth ,” nor does mrs . story proclaim that she loves her husband . <PARA> as we touched on earlier in this article , it ’ s a common phenomenon of urban legendry that amusing stories involving clever repartee often retroactively place words into the mouths of the famous people deemed most likely to have said them . sometimes , however , the designated mouths don ’ t really match up with the words assigned to them . johnny carson ’ s image has long been saddled with the claim that he made a risqué remark to a cat - carrying starlet on the tonight show , even though he was never known for employing that sort of crude sexual humor in his tv talk show host role . likewise , although it might seem that no one would fit a sexual double entendre involving a cigar better than groucho marx , even you bet your life producer robert dwan acknowledged ( as quoted above ) that it was too burlesque and not really groucho ’ s style . it was the kind of dirty put - down groucho might blurt out in private , but not to a kindly couple on a national radio program . groucho ’ s style on you bet your life was typically much gentler , as exemplified by the following exchange made under similar circumstances ( i . e ., when he questioned a female contestant who came from a family of seventeen children ): <PARA> it ’ s not inconceivable that the infamous “ cigar ” quip might have originated with this very exchange , when someone later misremembered or deliberately “ naughtied up ” the dialogue to better fit groucho ’ s public image and changed “ pancakes ” to “ cigar .” <PARA> note : various “ blooper ” records purport to offer an “ actual recording ” of groucho ’ s remark . however , those record makers typically employed recordings they made themselves using sound - alikes in order to “ re - create ” events for which no actual recording existed ( in most cases because the events were apocryphal ones that never took place ).
mixture	critics and observers of the american criminal justice system have long pointed to disparities and discrimination as one of its most significant and deeply - embedded problems . these disparities are perhaps most visible at the sentencing stage , where black individuals in particular are statistically proven to receive higher sentences — and for the same or similar crimes — than their white counterparts . <PARA> in that vein , in april 2018 the “ counter current news ” facebook page described the case of ramad chatman , in a widely - shared video . a voiceover narrates : <PARA> chatman ’ s case is a relatively complicated one , and the video gets most of the basic details right . however , it leaves out a crucial detail : the charge on which chatman was acquitted was not the same charge for which he was given a jail sentence , although the two cases were linked . <PARA> in july 2012 , 20 - year - old ramad ahshad chatman and three other men were charged with breaking into an apartment and stealing a television . chatman pleaded guilty , and floyd county superior court judge john niedrach agreed to deal with chatman under georgia ’ s first time offenders act and gave him five years ’ probation . this meant that , because chatman had not previously been convicted of a felony , he would avoid jail time and ultimately have the charges against him dismissed if he honored the terms of his probation . <PARA> in july 2014 , a clerk at the lucky lotto store on shorter avenue in rome , georgia was robbed at gunpoint by a black man . later that year , the store clerk saw chatman ’ s photograph on facebook and , convinced he was the man who robbed her , reported it to the police . the clerk positively identified chatman as the man who had robbed her at gunpoint . <PARA> in november 2015 , chatman became aware that he was a suspect in the lucky lotto robbery , and reported in person to police in rome , according to the atlanta , georgia nbc affiliate wxia - tv . he was arrested and charged with armed robbery . <PARA> in february 2016 , judge niedrach held a hearing on whether chatman had violated the terms of his probation on the 2012 theft . after hearing testimony from the lucky lotto store clerk , niedrach ruled that chatman had probably committed the lucky lotto armed robbery and thereby violated the terms of his probation . niedrach revoked chatman ’ s first - offender probation , which triggered an automatic conviction on the 2012 theft charges . <PARA> niedrach sentenced chatman to a ten - year prison sentence for the 2012 theft . because chatman had already spent four years on probation , niedrach suspended this portion of the sentence , effectively meaning chatman would spend six years in prison with his release provisionally scheduled for 2022 . <PARA> a jury acquitted chatman of armed robbery in the lucky lotto case in may 2016 . according to the rome news - tribune , chatman ’ s attorneys filed an emergency motion for niedrach to reconsider his revocation of chatman ’ s probation , since the judge ’ s ruling on the probation was based on his conclusion that chatman probably committed the lucky lotto armed robbery and a jury had just acquitted chatman of that charge . however , niedrach did not agree to reconsider his decision , because the jury trial — although it came to a different conclusion about chatman ’ s guilt — did not bring forth any new evidence . <PARA> judge niedrach appears to have acted according to the relevant georgia law , which states that a judge may revoke an individual ’ s probation either if that individual admits to violating one of the terms of their probation , or if in the judge ’ s opinion “ the evidence produced at the revocation hearing establishes by a preponderance of the evidence the violation or violations alleged .” <PARA> the judge indicated in floyd county superior court documents that there was “ proof by a preponderance of evidence ” that chatman had committed the armed robbery and that he had been in possession of a gun . this violated two conditions of his probation : that chatman would not “ violate the criminal laws of any governmental unit ;” or “ receive , possess or transport any firearm or other offensive weapon .” <PARA> in other words , in 2016 niedrach came to the conclusion that , on balance , the evidence mostly pointed towards chatman committing a crime and being in possession of a firearm in 2014 , and that was enough to revoke his probation and trigger his conviction and imprisonment on the 2012 charge . chatman was not jailed for the same charge on which he was acquitted , something that the counter current news video does not clarify , misleadingly claiming he was jailed “ even though he was found not guilty .” <PARA> similarly , when the video ’ s narrator says chatman “ never broke the terms of his probation ,” this denies viewers the full facts . although a jury acquitted chatman of the 2014 armed robbery , judge niedrach , in accordance with the procedures set out in georgia law , found that chatman had indeed broken two of the terms of his probation . <PARA> as of may 2018 , chatman remains incarcerated at rogers state prison in reidsville , georgia . his provisional release date is 6 july 2022 .
true	in april 2004 , a collection of about 100 biscuit tins accumulated by west country aristocrat count de salis was put up for auction in the uk by lawrences auctioneers . one item of especial interest from this collection was a tin produced by biscuit makers huntley and palmers , renowned for their elaborate biscuit packaging “ to the extent that the tin lids were designed to be displayed on kitchen walls .” the tin of interest came with a lid featuring an illustration of an edwardian garden party based on a painting by 19th century children ’ s illustrator kate greenaway . <PARA> what made this one tin particularly noteworthy was that the illustration on its lid included some background details most definitely not suitable for children : a jam jar bearing a label with a vulgar four - letter word for excrement , an image of two dogs copulating , and an image of two naked lovers engaging in some “ splendor in the grass ”: <PARA> according to news accounts , the tins with the risqué lid illustration had first been issued around 1980 , but the naughty details remained unnoticed until a shopkeeper finally spotted them with a magnifying glass years later ; by the time huntley and palmers ceased production of tins using that design , thousands of them had already been sold . <PARA> how did those scabrous images come to be part of the biscuit tin artwork in the first place ? the proffered explanation was a familiar one — it was a final act of revenge undertaken by a disgruntled , sacked employee : <PARA> we were a bit skeptical of this explanation , as most instances we ’ ve encountered of corporate shenanigans being attributed to disgruntled , revenge - seeking former employees actually turned out to be impish pranks carried out by non - disgruntled , non - vengeful current employees who allowed their penchants for levity to get the better of their senses of professional decorum . but regardless of how the salacious details came to be part of the titillating tin ’ s artwork , they were , as a huntley and palmers spokesman said , “ a funny example of what happens when things go wrong in the manufacturing process .” <PARA> on 8 april 2018 , the bbc published a video in which an illustrator explained “ how he sneaked ‘ naughty ’ images on to biscuit tins of a leading manufacturer , which were distributed world - wide ” as a “ prank .”
true	a graphic circulated online about 2018 georgia gubernatorial candidate stacey abrams ’ owing a lack sum in back taxes was technically accurate , but it omitted several key details for the sake of trying to frame her as being irresponsible or dishonest . <PARA> the meme showed a photograph of abrams along with a caption reading “ this is stacy [ sic ] abrams the democrat on the ticket for georgia governor . she owes the irs $ 50 , 000 in back taxes ”: <PARA> abrams publicly revealed that she owed a $ 54 , 000 debt to the internal revenue service when she released her personal financial disclosure documents in march 2018 . but although she is in debt , she is not delinquent in her taxes , as documents show her to be on a payment plan after deferring payments for tax years 2015 and 2016 . <PARA> the candidate elaborated on her situation in an op - ed published by fortune magazine on 24 april 2018 , saying that even though she earned $ 95 , 000 a year at her first job after graduating college , the cost of her education still left her more than $ 100 , 000 in debt before she had to take on even more financial responsibilities : <PARA> abrams ’ opponent in the 2018 gubernatorial race ( which she lost ), republican brian kemp , was reportedly also in heavy debt . he was sued by an investment company in june 2018 after allegedly failing to repay a $ 500 , 000 loan he guaranteed for an agricultural company in which he invested , hart agstrong llc . <PARA> kemp has claimed that he is not responsible for paying the loan , but the atlanta journal - constitution reported in september 2018 that according to court documents , kemp also promised to cover around $ 10 million in other loans for the company .
false	in mid - 2019 , one of the many hotly contested political issues in the united states was whether the forms to be used for the upcoming 2020 national census could ( or should ) include questions regarding citizenship status . the trump administration favored the addition of such questions , but after the u . s . supreme court initially blocked that move , the administration announced that the census bureau had “ started the process of printing the decennial questionnaires without the question .” <PARA> around that time , a social media meme purported to offer an image of the “ current census form ,” showing that the form did indeed include an “ unconstitutional ” question about the respondent ’ s citizenship status : <PARA> that image was not a photograph of the form to be used for the decennial u . s . census in 2020 , however . it was actually a picture of the questionnaire used for the american community survey ( acs ), which the u . s . census bureau sends out to about 3 . 5 million households across the u . s . every year . <PARA> as described on the u . s . census bureau ’ s website , the american community survey “ helps local officials , community leaders , and businesses understand the changes taking place in their communities . it is the premier source for detailed population and housing information about our nation ”: <PARA> although many of the same households that respond to the decennial u . s . census are also surveyed by the acs , and although some the same questions appear in both surveys , the census and the acs use distinctly different forms . <PARA> many critics would likely not find much distinction between the two , however . the american community survey is conducted by the u . s . census bureau , it was created in 2005 to replace the long form previously used by the decennial census , and responding to the acs is required by law ( as it is for the decennial census ). yet one has citizenship questions and the other does not . <PARA> perhaps not surprisingly , a study released in september 2018 by the center on poverty and inequality at georgetown university in washington , d . c ., found that the portion of respondents who did not answer the acs citizenship question more than doubled between 2010 through 2016 , from 2 . 7 % to 6 %.

false	on 29 january 2017 , the yournewswire fake news site published an article asserting that an npr study had determined that 25 million fraudulent votes had been cast for hillary clinton in the 2016 president election : <PARA> were the claim correct , it would mean more than a third of clinton ’ s near 67 million popular vote tally consisted of votes were “ completely fake .” there was , of course , no truth to that claim . <PARA> the purported “ npr study ” determining that 25 million fraudulent votes were cast for hillary clinton in november 2016 was not compiled by npr , had nothing to do with the 2016 election , and did not declare that 25 million votes had been determined to be fraudulent ( in any election ). <PARA> the referenced “ npr study ” was in fact a 14 february 2012 npr article about a pew research center report issued in 2012 . that pew report observed that “ approximately 24 million voter registrations in the united states are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate ,” but the npr article specifically noted that “ there ’ s little evidence that this has led to widespread voter fraud ”: <PARA> the continued inclusion of inaccurate or outdated registrations on voter rolls is a widespread problem that continues to plague many states and local voter boards , largely because of difficulties in matching up persons who have died or moved with the registration records they left behind . however , the existence of inaccurate or outdated registrations does not constitute voter fraud per se , nor is it evidence or proof that voter fraud is taking ( or has taken ) place . voter fraud only occurs when someone uses an invalid registration to illegally vote & mdash by , for example , assuming another person ’ s identity , voting multiple times , or voting in states in which they are no longer resident . the pew report did not track or measure any such fraudulent voting activity . <PARA> the pew research center report did not , as yournewswire falsely declared , state that 25 million fraudulent votes were cast in 2016 or in 2012 ( the year the report was published ) or in any other year , for hillary clinton or for any other candidate . the report antedated the 2012 election by more than four years , dealt only with voter registrations ( not actual votes ), and could not possibly be construed as documenting that 25 million fraudulent votes were cast for hillary clinton in 2016 .
false	one of the several forms of political clickbait that has sprung up in the online world in recent years the false attribution of controversial and inflammatory political statements to various celebrities , a form that has already appropriated the name of notables such as sandra bullock , bruce willis and demi moore . yet another expression of this misleading technique for generating clicks is attributing the sentiment that “ trump in one year is already better than 16 years of bush and obama put together ” to celebrities ranging from actress michelle pfeiffer to singer dolly parton : <PARA> neither of these women ( nor any other prominent entertainer ) gave voice to this thought ; it was actually a paraphrase of an opinion expressed by brett decker , a former wall street journal editor and the author of the book bowing to beijing : how barack obama is hastening america ’ s decline and ushering a century of chinese domination , while discussing economic policy during a radio interview on 5 january 2018 :

false	origins : love it or hate it , one can ’ t deny the amazing achievements of the mcdonald ’ s fast food restaurant empire . since the day ray kroc opened the first mcdonald ’ s franchise in des plaines , illinois , in 1954 ( after convincing dick and mac mcdonald of mcdonald ’ s restaurant in san bernardino , <PARA> california , to allow him to expand their operations ), mcdonald ’ s has grown into a multi - billion - dollar international corporation with over 28 , 000 outlets worldwide . <PARA> so ubiquitous and successful is mcdonald ’ s that is has now given rise to a number of “ exception ” legends — rumors asserting and expressing amazement that a particular locale is the only one of its kind not to boast a mcdonald ’ s restaurant , or is the only place where a mcdonald ’ s outlet has ever closed for lack of business . for example , the london times recently reported that british foreign office minister denis macshane is fond of pontificating that sarajevo ( the capital of the republic of bosnia and herzegovina ) and pyongyang ( the capital of north korea ) are the only two world capitals lacking a mcdonald ’ s . as the times acerbically noted : <PARA> a captivating statistic but , sadly , utter rubbish . somalia doesn ’ t even have a government , let alone a mcdonald ’ s . can you get chicken mcnuggets in mogadishu ? can you get a filet o ’ fish in mbabane ? will anyone in iran , iraq , afghanistan , angola , djibouti or ghana serve you a sausage and egg mcmuffin — even before 10 . 30 am ? <PARA> this “ statistic ” is intended to show off the global reach of mcdonald ’ s — only two world capitals on the entire globe are not home to a mcdonald ’ s , it claims , and the inference is that both those exceptions are due to aberrant conditions : sarajevo <PARA> because the former yugoslavia is too war - torn , and pyongyang because north korea is a notoriously closed , anti - western communist nation . the truth is that mcdonald ’ s is far from having even a single outlet in many countries of the world , much less one in every national capital . <PARA> the number of countries in the world varies slightly depending upon who ’ s doing the counting , but 192 is a reasonable figure . mcdonald ’ s itself claims locations only in 118 different countries on its country specific sites web page , which means 73 countries besides north korea have no mcdonald ’ s at all .

war anthems , this is practically punk rock . <PARA> the dixie chicks quickly became a locus of the war / anti - war controversy : one side heaped condemnation on maines for being publicly disrespectful of the president ( especially while war was imminent ), for making overt political statements in an inappropriate forum , and for being cowardly in addressing her remarks to a foreign audience ; the other defended her right to speak out in any time , place , and manner of her choosing and the importance of exercising such a right while the nation debated going to war . as the controversy grew , so did calls for boycotts of dixie chicks cds and live performances , the removal of dixie chicks songs from radio station playlists , and public trashing of dixie chicks merchandise . <PARA> the dixie chicks quickly offered an explanatory statement which did little to quell the furor : <PARA> “ we ’ ve been overseas for several weeks and have been reading and following the news accounts of our governments ’ position . the anti -

mixture	summary : the wyoming state legislature has proposed , but not yet passed or enacted , a bill that would prevent enforcement of federal gun control laws in that state . if passed , the bill would likely be subject to constitutional challenge . <PARA> origins : on 9 january 2013 , several members of the wyoming state legislature introduced a bill to that body called the firearm protection act ( hb0104 ) which seeks to establish “ that any federal law which attempts to ban a semi - automatic firearm or to limit the size of a magazine of a firearm or other limitation on firearms in this state shall be unenforceable in wyoming ”: <PARA> kroeker said he expects washington will push its current gun - control effort as far as it can . the obama administration has made it clear it ’ s considering proposals including a ban on sales of assault weapons , limits on high - capacity ammunition magazines and universal background checks for gun buyers . <PARA> “ i think there are a lot of people who would want to take all of our guns if they could ,” said kroeker . “ and they ’ re only restrained by the opposition of the people , and other lawmakers who are concerned about our rights .” <PARA> kroeker said it ’ s clear to him that wyoming has authority to make it a crime for federal agents to try to enforce a federal gun ban in the state . he noted state <PARA> resistance to illegal federal measures dates back to opposition to the federal alien and sedition acts of 1798 . <PARA> “ we ’ re a sovereign state with our own constitutional form of government ,” kroeker said . “ we ’ ve got a right to make our laws , and if the federal government is going to try to enforce unconstitutional laws on our people and take away the rights of wyoming citizens , then we as a state are going to step up and make that a crime .” <PARA> sen . larry hicks , r - baggs , is a co - sponsor of the bill . he said his constituents are “ absolutely terrified ” of the prospect of federal gun restrictions . <PARA> hicks said wyoming legislators are getting emails from all over the country in support of the bill . he said many residents of other states are saying they intend to urge their own legislators to follow suit . <PARA> “ even if congress doesn ’ t do this , given the statements from the president , they will surely try to restrict firearms ownership through executive order ,” hicks said . “ i think that ’ s the biggest threat we ’ re facing .” <PARA> rep . james byrd said he ’ s opposed to the legislation . “ if you want to pick a fight with the feds , let ’ s pick a fight with the feds that ’ s about something that means something ,” he said . <PARA> byrd said he believes that if wyoming passes the bill into law , it will lose in the federal courts . <PARA> the text of the bill calls for criminal penalties against any agent of the u . s . government who attempts to enforce federal regulations regarding personal firearms within the borders of wyoming and declares that any new federal regulations restricting ownership of , or the requiring the registration of , semiautomatic firearms shall not be enforceable in wyoming : <PARA> any official , agent or employee of the united states government who enforces or attempts to enforce any act , order , law , statute , rule or regulation of the united states government upon a personal firearm , a firearm accessory or ammunition that is owned or manufactured commercially or privately in wyoming and that remains exclusively within the borders of wyoming shall be guilty of a misdemeanor felony and , upon conviction , shall be subject to imprisonment for not more less than one ( 1 ) year and one ( 1 ) day or more than five ( 5 ) years , a fine of not more than two thousand dollars ($ 2 , 000 . 00 ) five thousand dollars ($ 5 , 000 . 00 ), or both . <PARA> the attorney general may defend a citizen of wyoming who is prosecuted by the united states government for violation of a federal law relating to the manufacture , sale , transfer or possession of a firearm , a firearm accessory or ammunition owned or manufactured and retained exclusively within the borders of wyoming . <PARA> any federal law , rule , regulation or order created or effective on or after january 1 , 2013 shall be unenforceable within the borders of wyoming if the law , rule , regulation or order attempts to : <PARA> ( i ) ban or restrict ownership of a semiautomatic firearm or any magazine of a firearm ; or <PARA> ( ii ) require any firearm , magazine or other firearm accessory to be registered in any manner . <PARA> this bill has not yet been voted upon or passed by the wyoming legislature . if it does pass , it likely will be subject to challenge in federal court , as previous attempts by states to nullify federal laws have been rejected by court rulings holding that the constitution establishes federal law as superior to state law .

mixture	u . s . democratic presidential candidate joe biden ’ s retelling of a harrowing war story turned into a media circus after the washington post reported that it “ never happened ” because details were misstated . <PARA> during a campaign event in hanover on aug . 23 , 2019 , biden recounted a story about his interaction with a heroic but grieving soldier . biden had traveled to konar province in afghanistan to pin a silver star on a navy captain who had tried to save his dying friend by braving enemy fire , biden said , rappelling into a ravine and carrying the friend out on his back . but the soldier didn ’ t want the medal , because his friend didn ’ t survive . <PARA> “ he said , ‘ sir , i don ’ t want the damn thing !'” biden said , per the post . “‘ do not pin it on me , sir ! please , sir . do not do that ! he died . he died !'” <PARA> the headline on the post ’ s story about biden ’ s statements reads , “ as he campaigns for president , joe biden tells a moving but false war story ,” and the post reported , “ based on interviews with more than a dozen u . s . troops , their commanders and biden campaign officials , it appears as though the former vice president has jumbled elements of at least three actual events into one story of bravery , compassion and regret that never happened .” <PARA> one question raised by the post was “ whether president trump ’ s routine falsehoods have changed the standards by which other presidential aspirants , including biden , should be judged ,” noting that trump has “ uttered more than 12 , 000 false or misleading statements , the washington post has found . he has continued to add to that total since then .” <PARA> the idea that the former vice president and 2020 democratic front runner lied about a war hero was a sensational one , and it spread quickly . shortly after the post story was published , other news organizations from across the political spectrum followed suit . the incident “ never happened ” or it was “ fabricated ,” echoed conservative outlets fox news and breitbart . “ joe biden tells false war story on campaign trail ,” reported a headline from the liberal msnbc . <PARA> the post reported biden may have conflated the heroic actions of kyle j . white , miles foltz and chad workman , all soldiers who were recognized for putting their lives at risk at different times and places in afghanistan to help others . <PARA> but there ’ s a difference between telling a story with the wrong details and telling a story that is fabricated . to claim that biden ’ s story is false might give readers the misleading impression that the soldier at the center of it doesn ’ t exist . <PARA> he does exist , and he did , in his grief , tell biden he didn ’ t want the medal biden pinned on him in 2011 . in fact , the post story contains an official white house image of biden pinning a medal on army staff sgt . workman and quotes workman confirming the central aspect of biden ’ s story , notwithstanding some of the finer details . <PARA> it wasn ’ t a silver star that biden pinned on workman , it was a bronze star . the site of the medal ceremony wasn ’ t konar province , it was wardak . and workman had tried to pull his friend from a burning vehicle , not a ravine . “ i never pulled him out because he was melting ,” workman told the post . <PARA> workman described the events and encounter with biden to the post like this : <PARA> although the post reported that biden may have conflated separate events in his telling of the story on different occasions , biden ’ s campaign has not addressed that claim . biden ’ s campaign spokesman , andrew bates , declined to comment when we reached him by telephone , instead pointing to a statement published by the post in which bates said that workman ’ s story is “ emblematic of the duty and sacrifice of the 9 / 11 generation of veterans .” <PARA> biden addressed the topic in an aug . 30 , 2019 , podcast interview with the post ’ s jonathan capehart , pushing back on the post ’ s reporting that his statements were false , or represented one of a series of gaffes made by biden :
mixture	in february 2016 , california officials announced that more than 600 , 000 undocumented people were granted driver ’ s licenses in 2015 ( the first year after ab 60 took effect ): <PARA> that announcement renewed interest in another california law , the “ new motor voter act ,” which was passed in october 2015 . the combination of these two acts , one allowing undocumented residents to obtain driver ’ s licenses , the other automatically registering citizens to vote when obtaining driver ’ s licenses , sparked fears ( which have been periodically resurrected for more than a decade ) that california was allowing undocumented residents to vote . <PARA> judge andrew napolitano gave a voice to these fears during an appearance on “ fox & friends ”: <PARA> but neither assembly bill 60 nor the new motor voter act provide undocumented immigrants with any additional federal benefits : <PARA> the law requires that applicants under the motor voter act attest that they meet all voter registration requirements , but critics maintain that the law “ lacks the necessary safeguards to keep noncitizens off the voter rolls .” although those critics fear that undocumented residents may slip through the loopholes and becomes registered to vote , it ’ s not accurate to say that california has made it “ legal ” for undocumented residents to vote . california secretary of state alex padilla asserted that the motor voter registration process was more secure than the existing automated registration procedure : <PARA> initially the law required that the state implement the california new motor voter program by 1 january 2020 , but a lawsuit over the issue resulted in a legislative amendation that pushed the date forward to april 2018 . <PARA> while it ’ s true that undocumented residents living in california can obtain driver ’ s licenses , the state has not passed any laws that also provide them the right to vote . the new motor voter act was passed in an effort to improve voter turnout , and while this law does automatically register citizens to vote when they obtain or renew their driver ’ s licenses , that action only applies to citizens who have already attested and / or documented an eligibility to vote . <PARA> in november 2016 , the california city of san francisco did pass a ballot proposition allowing some non - citizens to register to vote in local school board elections only .

unproven	from a number of fatalities standpoint , however , the data did not actually directly identify a single fatality , though it did anecdotally report one death : <PARA> while it might perhaps be possible to use this limited data to come up with a rough global estimate , no study has actually attempted to do this with systematic methodology . as such , there is no way to debunk the claim with 100 percent certainty . we can say , though , that newspaper reports of death from falling coconuts are far more sparse than reports of death from shark attacks . a 1973 article in the honolulu star - bulletin detailed the tragic death of a 2 - year old girl struck by a large number of falling coconuts on a beach , while claiming that as far as they could tell , this was the first newspaper report of such an incident in the area : <PARA> the fact that this 1973 story has been cited decades after the fact ( for example from a 1999 edition of the honolulu advertiser below ), at least superficially reinforces the notion that death from falling coconut is a rare ( but real ) occurrence : <PARA> we rank this as unproven because accurate , published estimates on the global annual rate of death from falling coconut do not yet exist . given the dearth of firsthand accounts of death from falling coconut , however , it seems unlikely that they pose more of a threat to human health than do sharks — even if death from either event is extremely unlikely .

false	glurge : young todd beamer receives pitching tips from baseball great jackie robinson . <PARA> origins : what ’ s better than a glurgy piece of fiction created to embellish a hero ’ s reputation ? how about a fabricated account that brings together two heroes in a work of glurgerrific <PARA> synergy ? <PARA> this touching and inspiring item intertwines the lives of jackie robinson , the man who became an icon for the american civil rights movement after breaking major league baseball ’ s color barrier in 1947 , and todd beamer , one of the heroes of the flight 93 crash on september 11 whose last recorded words (“ let ’ s roll ”) have become a catchphrase for resistance to terrorism . unfortunately , this item is also false all around : it is not a “ true story ,” nor did it appear in the book chicken soup for the adolescent soul . ( there is no such book : the chicken soup folks have published chicken soup for the teenage soul , chicken soup for the preteen soul , and chicken soup for the kid ’ s soul , but as yet no chicken soup for the adolescent soul .) <PARA> how do we know it ’ s not true ? after his final season of baseball in 1956 , robinson served as a spokesman and executive for various companies before dying of a heart attack in 1972 at the relatively young age of 53 — he never became an “ old man ” who spent his final days shuffling around suburban baseball fields looking for coins with a metal detector . moreover , it ’ s hard to imagine the circumstances under which todd beamer and jackie robinson could have accidentally crossed paths : beamer was born in flint , michigan , and spent his childhood in wheaton , illinois , but robinson lived nowhere near either of those places in his post - retirement years . <PARA> however , the telling blow is that todd beamer was born on 24 november 1968 . if little todd was getting “ shellacked 21 - 0 in the first game of the season ” as a little league pitcher when he met jackie robinson , it ’ s no wonder : robinson died in october of 1972 , when todd beamer was only three years old . it ’ s tough to get batters out when you ’ re too young to throw the ball even halfway to home plate .
true	lee de forest ( 1873 - 1961 ) was an inventor who made significant contributions to the field of electronic communications . his key work in the areas of wireless telegraphy , broadcast radio , and synchronized - sound films led to his being referred to as the “ father of radio ” and the “ father of electronics .” <PARA> but de forest is also known , in a lesser sense , for famously demonstrating that persons notable for achievements in one field of science aren ’ t necessarily reliable prognosticators about other scientific fields . for it was de forest who boldly proclaimed in the 1950s that humanity ’ s sending a man to the moon and returning him to earth alive was merely a jules verne - esque fantasy , a “ voyage [ that ] will never occur regardless of all future scientific advances .” <PARA> he made his remarks during an interview with voice of america radio , as reported by the associated press in february 1957 : <PARA> that was not the first of de forest ’ s pronouncements along such lines . in an article for popular mechanics published five years earlier , the scientist had asserted : “ i do not foresee ‘ spaceships ’ to the moon or mars . mortals must live and die on earth or within its atmosphere !” <PARA> however , de forest was at least correct in anticipating the first “ artificial earth satellite ” would be launched in 1957 , as the soviet union put sputnik i into low earth orbit on oct . 4 , 1957 . the soviets also accomplished the first manned space flight less than four years later , launching cosmonaut yuri gagarin in vostok 1 for a single earth orbit on april 12 , 1961 . <PARA> but it only took the united states to prove de forest wrong with the july 1969 mission of apollo 11 that landed astronauts neil armstrong and buzz aldrin on the moon and then returned them safely to earth .
true	this article discussed the potential implications of a case that was , at the time of writing , undecided by the supreme court . on 17 june 2019 the supreme court decided that case , rejecting arguments that could have resulted in a stronger presidential pardon . far from kavanaugh ’ s being a deciding vote on the case , the court ruled 7 - 2 against the notion that federal and state prosecution for the same crime violates the so - called “ double jeopardy clause ” of the constitution . justices ruth bader ginsburg and neil m . gorsuch dissented . <PARA> on 29 november 2015 , a motorist named terance gamble , who had been convicted of second degree robbery seven years earlier , was pulled over by an alabama police officer because of a faulty headlight on his vehicle . upon searching the car , the officer found a handgun , among other items . it is illegal under both alabama law and united states law for convicted felons to possess firearms , and gamble was eventually sentenced to one year in prison on that charge by the state of alabama . <PARA> during gamble ’ s prosecution under alabama law for possession of a firearm as a felon , the federal government also charged him with the same crime . gamble ’ s lawyers argued that this second conviction was a violation of the u . s . constitution ’ s ban on “ double jeopardy ,” which is intended to protect people from being prosecuted for the same crime more than once . the double jeopardy clause is found in fifth amendment to the u . s . constitution , which states ( in part ) that “ no person shall ... be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb .” specifically , the clause has been interpreted to be a prohibition on : <PARA> gamble has been in federal prison since entering a guilty plea on 18 october 2016 that allowed him to appeal his case . in june 2018 , the supreme court agreed to hear his argument that he has been unconstitutionally punished multiple times for the same crime . while the case is about the constitutionality of a man being charged twice for the same gun possession incident in a narrow sense , the case more broadly has the potential to significantly alter 150 years of supreme court precedent . <PARA> since the 1850s , the supreme court has allowed for one explicit exception to the constitution ’ s double jeopardy protections : cases of dual sovereignty ( or “ separate sovereigns ”) which stem from view that the federal government and state governments are distinct entities with occasionally overlapping jurisdictions . ( exceptions to this exception exist which seek to limit double prosecutions at the federal level , but as this case shows they do not always have that effect .) <PARA> this ” separate sovereigns ” exception to double jeopardy , though built on several previous rulings , was made most explicit in a 1920s bootlegging case , united states v . lanza , which allowed a man to be charged with bootlegging crimes by both the state of washington and the federal government . with respect to that case , chief justice william howard taft argued : <PARA> the separate sovereigns exemption has for much of its history been a controversial precedent which critics maintain is not rooted in the original text of the constitution but is instead cobbled together from different partially relevant supreme court decisions — decisions rooted in a time when the federal government was less powerful and whose questions never directly sought to address the explicit matter of double punishment for the same crime in state and federal jurisdictions . this argument is reflected in gamble ’ s filing . <PARA> the government argues in this case that the precedent is well - established through myriad supreme court cases and consistent with the founding fathers ’ vision of state and federal government duality : <PARA> in this case , gamble has explicitly asked the supreme court to rule on a single specific question : “ whether the court should overrule the “ separate sovereigns ” exception to the double jeopardy clause .” <PARA> the reason gamble v . united states is generating buzz from people other than constitutional law scholars is that the separate sovereigns exception also prevents president trump from pardoning people for state crimes . under current supreme court precedent , a presidential pardon of an individual does not prevent that individual from being prosecuted for the same or similar crimes under state law . “ under the dual sovereignty doctrine ,” adam j . adler wrote in the yale law review , “ as long as two offenses are defined by different jurisdictions , they cannot constitute the ‘ same offense .’” <PARA> the congressional research service issued an august 2018 report on the potential ramifications of the case , and this report included a discussion of its possible effect on the presidential pardon power : <PARA> some pundits have speculated that the reason why certain politicians seem to be in a rush to seat judge brett kavanaugh on the supreme court is that is that he has a notably strong view of presidential powers and therefore would be a vote in favor of gamble and for an expansion of presidential pardon powers — and the supreme court announced they would be hearing this case the day after justice kennedy ’ s retirement . this temporal proximity has prompted some commenters to opine that the rush might be motivated by a desire to limit the president ’ s legal liability in the russia probe and other investigations : <PARA> while we cannot speculate on the motives of politicians who are supporting judge kavanaugh ’ s nomination , the atlantic reported that prominent political legal scholars agree in a general sense with the view of this case ’ s having importance with regard to president trump ’ s pardon power : <PARA> the atlantic also reported that at least one member of the senate judiciary committee who approved kavanaugh for a floor vote before the full senate , orrin hatch , has publicly weighed in on the topic ( unmotivated , he says , by the implications for the pardon power ), filing an amicus curiae brief in favor of gamble which argued that “ the pervasive federalization of criminal law to cover conduct that traditionally was prosecuted and punished by the states , and that falls within the states ’ core legislative interests , threatens to undermine the protections of the double jeopardy clause unless the dual sovereignty doctrine is overruled in this context .” <PARA> oral arguments for the case have not been scheduled but will occur during this supreme court term . if confirmed , judge kavanaugh could become a deciding vote in the case .

false	on 7 august 2016 facebook user megan erickson published the following post to facebook , reporting she narrowly avoided being abducted in the parking lot of a walmart in darboy , wisconsin : <PARA> erickson maintained that a woman attempted to lure her to the stranger ’ s vehicle under the auspices of sparing her ( i . e ., erickson ) further embarrassment due to the unexpected start of a menstrual period staining her clothes . however , erickson said that she was surprised by the claim due to confirmed and permanent amenorrhea ( i . e ., absence of menstruation ). <PARA> as an alleged scheme for luring human trafficking victims , the scenario presented here doesn ’ t sound like a well - thought out one . most women are roughly aware of when to expect their monthly cycles ( or regularly use hormonal birth control , which regulates periods ), and even if the bizarre proposal initially fooled a tiny pool of woman , those putative victims — already on the way back to their own cars — could simply hotfoot it home in their own vehicles and change clothes rather than visiting a stranger ’ s car to take someone else ’ s clothing <PARA> the claim was already treading a line of dubious plausibility when it went on to include the presence of a visiting police officer within earshot . as is common in viral facebook kidnap warning posts , the “ ambient police officer ” character provides the narrative service of explaining what was otherwise a perplexing interaction . erickson stated that the traveling cop warned her that the “ trick is just one of many used to abduct unsuspecting women ” and offered to wait with her while she contacted police but did not himself intervene . ( had the officer been out of earshot , the anecdote likely wouldn ’ t have worked as a parable .) <PARA> erickson asserted that she was not just passing on a story , claiming that the incident personally happened to her on 7 august 2016 : <PARA> erickson ’ s account of a near - miss was one of dozens of pearl - clutching facebook posts warning women about the convoluted means by which human trafficking scouts purportedly lure prey in popular in retail environments ( and occasionally other public spaces ). in june 2016 two similar stories of human traffickers circulated in louisiana and rochester , minnesota about public parks , and a july 2016 viral warning about kay jewelers ‘ rings - as - bait at a wisconsin mall was one of the many circulating in perpetuity about human traffickers and big box stores ’ parking lots . <PARA> during the summer of 2015 , countless “ human trafficking warning ” facebook and social media posts went viral despite the fact such stories rarely ( if ever ) reflected realistic dangers : in may 2015 , a woman warned of a later - debunked incident at an oklahoma hobby lobby store ; in june 2015 , twitter was overrun with tweets about sex slavery rings targeting college kids at summer job interviews ; and later that same month a long - circulating theme park abduction urban legend popped up again . those popular warnings bred a frightening ( and fabricated ) story about purported teenaged abductors ( using heroin - filled syringes to drug victims ) at a denton , texas , dillards department store , a claim from a woman who maintained she narrowly avoided human traffickers using gift bags as bait in the parking lot of a hickory , north carolina , walmart store , and subsequent rumors claimed target stores in tampa , longview ( texas ), and houston were sex trafficking scouting hotbeds . <PARA> in all instances , the described interactions turned out to be misunderstood , vastly overstated , or entirely fabricated ( such as a woman ’ s claim about an unsettling encounter at a michigan kroger store ) and were typically appended with lengthy treatises about how such narrow misses are every day occurrences that could happen to you . a common thread among the stories is a suggestion that abductors use gifts or promises of assistance to disarm female shoppers , as if such a ruse were necessary to abduct a person . the tales possibly served a greater purpose as talismans , providing readers with a belief that horrible tragedies were avoidable if they managed to resist gift bags , free rings , or other distracting objects . in the retellings , readers and spreaders of the rumors could feel they remained one step ahead of crafty criminals , well equipped to prevent themselves from becoming victims . <PARA> these warnings posit the unlikely scenario abductors will opt to risk approaching randomly - chosen women , conspicuously attempt a questionable engagement ploy , and risk capture or notice by law enforcement agents or store security . age - old urban legends about robbers enticing victims with perfume samples persist and evolve in large part due to the entrenched belief that criminals can and do operate in this fashion ; consequently , people are primed by years of exposure to the rumors to interpret any and all atypical parking lot encounters as affirmative of near - misses with abductors : <PARA> similar ( never substantiated ) rumors about $ 100 bills placed under windshield wipers evidence the same lack of familiarity with the basics of such activity , describing a criminal plot that poses needless risk and a low return on investment for putative abductors or carjackers : <PARA> in summation , the darboy walmart warning isinconsistent with the known patterns associated with human traffickers ( described at length in the united nations office on drugs and crime faq about human trafficking ). the rumor is yet another variation on an urban legend that has circulated for at least two decades , a period during which we ’ ve never located any substantiated instances of such an abduction occurring . <PARA> we contacted the appleton city police department near the darboy walmart to ask about the rumor and spoke with a public information officer there . that officer said the department was aware of and investigating the claim , confirming that no calls or reports were made from the darboy walmart on 7 august 2016 . <PARA> law enforcement sources repeatedly explain to us in response to these types of rumors that human traffickers typically recruit victims by attempting to establish relationships ( and even a degree of trust ) with them ; abducting random victims from store parking lots via a convoluted and risky gambit doesn ’ t fit any known pattern of that crime . and again , the presumptive goal of securing targets outside their vehicles could be accomplished much more efficiently by simply intercepting passersby parked in desolate areas of a parking lot with no premise for interaction required . <PARA> on 8 august 2016 , the appleton police department issued a statement via facebook confirming that the story was “ fabricated ”:

unproven	they were stuck together while frolicking in the sea and had to be taken to the hospital as a medical emergency to be released from their hold on each other . <PARA> is this true ? it ’ s raising a few eyebrows among the genteel ladies in the boxes . <PARA> origins : on 15 october 2014 , italian tabloid il mattino published an article about a <PARA> mortifying sexual mishap off the coast of porto san giorgio , italy . according to the article , two unnamed beachgoers became amorously inclined while swimming and decided to engage in an aquatic quickie . <PARA> at some point during the seaside sexcapade , however , their liaison went downhill : reportedly , underwater suction caused the couple to become “ stuck ” together and forced them to sheepishly request assistance . a rough translation of the italian - language article indicated that the embarrassed lovers were forced to somehow swim to shore in flagrante delicto , where they happened upon a convenient doctor : <PARA> so , in panic and fatigue , they reached the shore and called a doctor who accompanied them to the emergency room , where the woman was given an injection commonly used to dilate the uterus of pregnant women , the administration of which rectified the situation . <PARA> several other web sites aggregated the single - source , medically noteworthy claim as real news despite a number of red flags in the story . most notably , the tale closely matches the oft - repeated penis captivus urban legend , which has a notorious lack of corroborating evidence across decades of medical literature . <PARA> as is common to earlier versions of similar stories , the couple in the report were purportedly whisked away to the emergency room for separation . but no mention was made of how such a complex medical transport might have occurred . were they lifted into an ambulance by paramedics ? did they somehow manage to walk to a vehicle for the journey ? was any provision made to avoid an embarrassing spectacle or to shield the pair and onlookers ? and if treatment wasn ’ t rendered on the scene , why was a doctor called upon to remove the couple to the emergency room rather than standard emts ? <PARA> the lack of detail given in the original news report and its subsequent repetitions are also suspect . while one might expect patient names to be withheld due to the sensitive nature of the claim , the name of the hospital to which the pair was transported did not appear in any reports , nor were any of the treating doctors identified by name or quoted . moreover , the date of the incident given in the original source was specified only as “ yesterday ,” with no time of day mentioned at all . <PARA> finally , the story concluded with the administration of a “ drug given to pregnant women to dilate their uteruses ,” but the efficacy of such an approach is questionable — a simple muscle relaxant should have been able to rectify the situation had it really occurred . <PARA> in short , proof that an unlucky italian couple really experienced unfortunate sexual suction during a seaside tryst is scant , and decades of medical literature and several logistical inconsistencies suggest the tale was , at best , shakily sourced .

false	origins : shortly after burger king announced in december 2014 it was resurrecting the yumbo sandwich , hundreds of potential customers read the news and wondered : what is a yumbo ? <PARA> soon a rumor started circulating claiming the yumbo never existed and burger king had invented the sandwich in an attempt to manufacture nostalgia for an imaginary menu item . although many people had trouble remembering this ham and cheese hoagie , the yumbo was not a corporate conspiracy manufactured to oust mcdonald ’ s mcrib as fast food ’ s most mysterious sandwich . <PARA> one reason for the confusion surrounding the yumbo may stem from the fact that the majority of social media users weren ’ t alive in the 1970s . a pew research study conducted in 2013 found the majority of twitter users were between the ages of 18 and 29 , which makes them too young to recall a sandwich that was discontinued in 1974 . <PARA> fast food demographics could also explain why some people are having a hard time remembering the yumbo . a gallup poll in 2013 found adults between the ages of 18 - 29 were much more likely to eat fast foods than people over 50 ; so statistically , people who remember the yumbo from the 1970s just aren ’ t as likely to be eating at burger king in 2015 . <PARA> finally , the yumbo may have been forgotten by most 1970s burger king customers simply because the sandwich was ... forgettable . while reviews for the original yumbo are hard to find online , grubgrade gives burger king ’ s current yumbo offering a 2 out of 10 : <PARA> avoid this mess and don ’ t fall into the “ lowest common denominator pit ”. i know this is just fast food , but the yumbo hot ham & cheese is an example of very little effort by burger king . save your money . you might like it if you ’ re under the age of 9 . <PARA> the original yumbo may not have been a favorite at burger king , but it certainly did exist . it has appeared on several “ discontinued fast food items ” lists over the years and was included in a 1970s commercial about bk ’ s specialty sandwiches :
false	origins : in 1990 , a clerk for a steinberg grocery store in eastern ontario discovered something in a pepsi bottle he at first mistook for a straw . a closer examination revealed the item to be a syringe , and the bottle was rescued from the shelf before it fell into the <PARA> hands of a consumer . the find was turned over to store management , who in turn brought it to the attention of health and welfare canada . health and welfare canada launched an investigation into the incident , and although they ultimately achieved no official resolution of the case , they reasoned the likely culprit was a disgruntled employee of the bottler , eastcan beverages of ottawa , ontario . the incident was not repeated ; no more syringes turned up in any other bottles . <PARA> in an eerie way , that 1990 find was the precursor to the 1993 pepsi syringe panic . once again , hypodermic needles and this particular brand of cola met up , but this time the confluence of the two was pyrotechnic . <PARA> in the space of two days in june 1993 , news stories about finds of syringe - laden cans of pepsi swept the usa . for a short time it looked like a widespread instance of product tampering was underway . the first report came on 9 june 1993 from an 82 - year - old man in tacoma , washington , who said he looked into a can of diet pepsi to see if he had won a prize and found a syringe . ( he had not noticed the hypodermic when he poured himself a drink from the can ; he found the needle the next day .) soon afterwards , similar reports flooded in from all over the usa . at least 52 reports of tampering in at least 23 states were ultimately made before this scare ran its course . <PARA> though most of the “ finds ” involved syringes ( a woman in portland , oregon , said she found two in a single glass ), the list of items allegedly recovered from pepsi , diet pepsi , and caffeine free diet pepsi cans included a wood screw , a bullet , a crack vial , a broken sewing needle , and a mysterious blob of brown goo . <PARA> pepsi and the food and drug administration soon ruled out product tampering as the cause of these “ finds .” it quickly became obvious the beverager was the victim of a spontaneous hoax . once the first find was publicized , a number of unscrupulous people who sought to cash in on it created a rolling wave of growing hysteria , as each news story prompted another phony “ find ” which in turn prompted another news story . those looking for a quick buck reasoned it would be terribly easy to coax a little money out of pepsi by claiming to have found needles in their drinks . this was a con that didn ’ t take much to set up ; all one needed was an opened can of pepsi and a syringe . with so many real finds turning up , the company would be quick to pay off anyone who stood in line — or so the con artists thought . what they failed to realize was that all the finds ( with the exception of the first ) were bogus , and so they were all trying to pull the same scam as everyone <PARA> else . <PARA> ( no plausible explanation for that first find ever came to light . the needle discovered by the elderly tacoma couple was bent in the manner responsible insulin users are taught to leave a used syringe , and discarding such an implement in a soda can is a disposal method favored by many who have to regularly give themselves injections . yet the only diabetic of the couple ’ s acquaintance hadn ’ t been in their home in eleven years . there was a further puzzling fact : the syringe supposedly turned up in a can of diet pepsi which came from a 24 - can case of regular pepsi .) <PARA> once pepsi and the fda was sure they knew what was going on , pepsi launched an all - out campaign to reassure alarmed customers who dreaded getting stuck by needles secreted in their drinks . officials at bottling plants threw open their doors to the press , demonstrating how it was virtually impossible to place an object in a can , and pointing out that even if that were accomplished , the tampered can would be easy to detect . ( in 1993 pepsi was producing 2 , 000 cans a minute at 150 plants on high - speed canning lines in which cans were inverted , shot with a blast of air or water , and then turned right side up and filled . since the cans were open for only nine - tenths of a second , someone would have had to be awful quick to get a syringe into any of them .) the company took out ads in twelve national newspapers , and bottlers ran notices in 300 to 400 local dailies telling readers that the stories about pepsi were a hoax . the fda spokespeople spread the same message on pepsi ’ s behalf . <PARA> ultimately , the federal bureau of investigation made twenty bunko arrests of people who had planted syringes or other objects in their drinks , and many other would - be claimants who had less seriously dabbled with making false claims against pepsi recanted their stories . some complainants were obviously pranksters , while others seemed to be trying to cash in on spurious injury claims . a few seemed only to want the attention of the news media — a paltry kind of fame , but apparently sufficient for some to want to seek it . <PARA> media coverage , denials , arrests — pepsi fought the rumors of product tampering as actively and publicly as it was possible to fight them . yet was it enough ? needle - find hysteria in 1993 was nothing compared to what it would be now , when every found hypodermic is presumed to be laden with the aids virus , but even so pepsi will long be remembered as the soft drink with a syringe . the bell of rumor could not be unrung , even had the media cooperated . <PARA> unfortunately , the media didn ’ t cooperate . as gail de vos points out in her 1996 tales , rumors , and gossip , accounts of obvious post - purchase can tampering never came close to achieving the same level of prominence in the press as accounts of the original horrifying find did . as an example , she cites coverage by the edmonton journal , which was typical of how many news outlets handled resolution of this news story : “ the first two articles appeared in the front section of the paper but the final outcome was not considered of equal importance — hence its appearance in the e section !” <PARA> while the slogan “ if it bleeds , it leads ” holds just as true here as with any other news topic , one might just as rightly coin “ once it ’ s nary ’ d , it gets buried .” tidy , fact - filled resolution articles that explain away previous misreporting just aren ’ t nearly as interesting to the public as headlines which scream “ beware of this lurking danger : it could happen to you !” the press know that , so articles of such ilk get tossed deep into the paper where most folks won ’ t encounter them . <PARA> this escalates the problem of an increasingly hysterical public : uneven coverage leads folks to believe their world is fraught with lurking dangers . why should they not believe just that when the front page is filled day after day with one horrific story after another , yet the calm , rational stuff is habitually buried in the e section ? <PARA> the “ syringe in the pepsi can ” tale is a fine case in point of the results of this form of weighted reporting . <PARA> although most folks who were media - aware in 1993 remember news stories about needles found in soft drink cans , not all that many of them could now ( or even back then ) tell you the whole thing turned out to be a hoax , an attempt on the part of a number of miscreants to rifle the deep pockets of a large corporation . to the majority , the story will always remain “ bad guys hid needles in pepsi cans , and i could have gotten hurt ,” not “ scam artists tried to shake down pepsi by pretending to find tampered cans .” <PARA> barbara “ all that ’ s now remembered is the fizz ” mikkelson

false	if you ’ ve landed on this page , odds are another mass shooting has occurred in the united states . <PARA> we don ’ t say this flippantly . depending on how you define “ mass shooting ” ( there ’ s a discussion of the various ways to do so here ), as of 7 august 2019 there had been no fewer than seven ( according to mother jones magazine ) and as many as 254 ( according to the gun violence archive ) mass shootings in the u . s . during that year alone . <PARA> in the deadliest mass shooting to date , on 1 october 2017 , 58 people were killed and 546 were wounded at an outdoor concert in las vegas by a lone shooter armed with 23 guns . even for a nation painfully accustomed to grappling with gun violence , this was an immense loss . yet among the outpourings of grief , the pangs of soul searching and regret , and the inevitable calls for tougher gun regulations , there was also this — a decades - old ( 1996 vintage , by our best estimate ) recitation of the horrors of “ gun control ,” freshly re - shared for the occasion : <PARA> all of those assertions beg for fact checking , but before we dig into the particulars it will be useful to recall some of the history of america ’ s unique relationship with firearms for clues as to why someone might feel posting such a polemic is called for . <PARA> in addition to boasting the highest rate of gun ownership per capita of any country in the world ( and the highest firearm - related homicide rate of any developed country , according to the american journal of medicine ), americans have a thing called the “ gun control debate .” to be sure , most other countries wrestle with how and to what extent private gun ownership ought be regulated as well , but the issue has a special potency for u . s . citizens thanks to what is known as “ the right to keep and bear arms ,” a birthright guaranteed and protected for the past 200 - plus years by the second amendment to the u . s . constitution , which reads : <PARA> arguments about how to properly interpret the vaguely - worded amendment remain at the heart of the gun control debate two centuries later . in simplest terms , there are two schools of thought , one holding that the second amendment protects a collective right for the purpose of providing for the common defense ( emphasis on the “ well - regulated militia ” clause ), and the other holding that it protects an individual right irrespective of any such collective purpose . <PARA> one finds both readings anticipated in individual state constitutions adopted prior to the ratification of the second amendment . while north carolina ’ s 1776 constitution limited the purpose of the right to bear arms to defending the state , for example (“... the people have a right to bear arms , for the defense of the state ”), as did the massachusetts constitution of 1780 (“ the people have a right to keep and bear arms for the common defense ”), the 1776 and 1777 constitutions of pennsylvania and vermont specified that “... the people have a right to bear arms for the defense of themselves and the state .” <PARA> historically , the u . s . supreme court has swung both ways in interpreting the second amendment , favoring the “ common defense ” reading for the better part of the twentieth century before veering sharply to an individual “ self - defense ” interpretation with its landmark district of columbia v . heller decision of 2008 . <PARA> associate justice antonin scalia ’ s majority opinion in that decision , which overturned a law prohibiting handgun possession in washington , d . c ., hinged mainly on a careful parsing of the language of the amendment that reveals , scalia argued , an intent on the part of the framers to protect an individual right completely independent of the militia clause . interestingly , however , he went on to make the tangential case that , anyway , the framers understood “ militia ” to mean a “ people ’ s militia ” made up of private citizens whose right to bear arms could not be abrogated by their own government , thus providing a “ safeguard against tyranny ”: <PARA> the dissenting justices in the case ( the more liberal contingent : stevens , souter , ginsburg , and breyer ) argued that the established interpretation of the second amendment upheld by previous supreme courts ( namely that the “ well - regulated militia ” clause was meant to restrict the scope of the protected right to a collective , not an individual one ) ought to stand , with breyer adding that even granting an individual - right interpretation of the amendment , restrictions such as handgun bans and trigger - lock requirements would still be constitutional . <PARA> in any case , the heller decision was music to the ears of pro - firearms groups such as the national rifle association ( nra ), and not just because it went in their favor . for decades , the premise that private gun ownership is synonymous with freedom and resisting tyranny had been a cornerstone of the nra ’ s lobbying and recruitment efforts . for example , a full - page newspaper ad for the group in 1989 read : <PARA> it ’ s but a short step from there to the more extreme assertion that any effort to restrict the right to bear arms is itself a prelude to ( if not an instance of ) tyranny — which is in fact the tack taken in the internet text before us . relying on absolutist language that does not distinguish between regulation and confiscation , the text trumpets the conclusion that 56 million people were rounded up and exterminated during the twentieth century “ because of gun control .” <PARA> tempting as it is to dismiss that kind of language as mere rhetoric , bear in mind that a sizable portion of the american public buys into the “ slippery slope ” mentality that undergirds it , with 52 percent of republican party voters agreeing in a 2015 public opinion poll , for example , that it is somewhat - to - very likely that “ stricter gun laws will eventually lead to the federal government trying to take away guns from americans who legally own them .” this is the text ’ s target audience . <PARA> the term “ gun control ” is not , in fact , synonymous with “ gun confiscation ,” “ gun prohibition ,” or “ gun registration ” ( although gun control can take any of those forms ). nor is the “ gun control debate ” about whether or not gun control laws ought to exist in the united states at all — they already do on both the federal and state levels , because the right to bear arms must be balanced against the safety and well - being of the populace as a whole . in practical terms , gun control boils down to addressing issues such as how to keep lethal weapons out of the hands of criminals and the mentally deranged , how to regulate their manufacture and sale , and what types of firearms and ammunition are appropriate for private citizens to own and use . <PARA> besides leaving the term undefined and implying it means taking away people ’ s weapons , the text fallaciously asserts a causal link between “ gun control ” and mass exterminations . the argument fails to take into account other determining factors — most notably , what sorts of political regimes committed all these atrocities ( hint : they weren ’ t democracies ). it also fails to take into account counter - examples of nations ( including the united states ) with longstanding gun control laws on the books where no mass exterminations have occurred . consider , too , that , in several of the cited instances the gun control laws in effect when the genocides took place were enacted years or even decades earlier . <PARA> it ’ s further implied that unrestricted private gun ownership would have prevented the genocides from occurring . although a greater availability of weapons would have put targeted populations in a better position to defend themselves , however , it ’ s not a given that they would have prevailed over the better - equipped , better - trained government forces sent to annihilate them . <PARA> as best we can determine , most of the facts and figures cited in the text are very loosely based on research published in two ( now out - of - print ) books , death by ‘ gun control ’ by aaron zelman and richard w . stevens , published by mazel freedom press in 2001 , and lethal laws : gun control is the key to genocide by jay simkin , aaron zelman , and alan m . rice , published by jews for the preservation of firearms ownership ( jpfo ) in 1994 . we ’ ve relied on scholarly reviews of those books ( mainly dave kopel ’ s “ lethal laws ,” published in the new york law school journal of international and comparative law in 1995 ) for access to some of the authors ’ original research and findings , which have been garbled almost beyond recognition in the text we will now examine in more detail . <PARA> the time period cited , 1929 to 1953 , roughly coincides with dictatorship of joseph stalin , whose regime was responsible for the deaths of many millions of people , though historians disagree on the total . for a long time , 20 million was the generally accepted number , but since the fall of the soviet union more documentation has become available . <PARA> “ exact numbers may never be known with complete certainty , but the total of deaths caused by the whole range of the soviet regime ’ s terrors can hardly be lower than some 15 million ,” wrote historian robert conquest in his 2008 book the great terror : a reassessment , to cite one example . in 2011 , yale historian timothy snyder cited a significantly lower number , 6 million , as “ the total figure of civilians deliberately killed under stalinism .” either way , it ’ s not strictly accurate to say that all of stalin ’ s victims were “ rounded up and exterminated .” more than 3 million died of forced starvation . <PARA> gun control regulations , including a requirement to register all weapons with the government , were in force during that period . “ policemen were responsible for gun control ,” writes katherine bliss eaton in daily life in the soviet union ( greenwood publishing group , 2004 ): <PARA> large - scale gun confiscations were aimed at subpopulations deemed to be subversive or dissident . for example , robert conquest reports in the harvest of sorrow : soviet collectivization and the terror - famine ( oxford university press , 1987 ) that rural peasants were disarmed en masse for purposes of enforcing the social policy of “ agricultural collectivization ,” which the peasants resisted : <PARA> gun registration and targeted confiscations therefore played an essential role in stalin ’ s genocidal activities . <PARA> this entry refers to the armenian genocide , in which as many as 1 . 5 million armenians ( then a persecuted christian minority concentrated in the eastern provinces of ottoman turkey ) were massacred by the ottoman empire . <PARA> with regard to gun ownership , non - muslims had never been legally permitted to privately own weapons under ottoman rule ( though some did ), but military conscription laws enacted by a newly constituted government ( the so - called “ young turks ”) between 1908 and 1914 put guns in the hands of tens of thousands of armenians drafted to fight for the empire in world war i . after suffering military losses early on in that war , the government blamed the armenians , whom they accused of treachery and subversion , and on that pretext embarked on a program of disarming and eradicating the armenian population as a whole . <PARA> new york times foreign correspondent john kifner wrote : <PARA> the armenians had been officially prohibited from owning firearms for hundreds of years in the ottoman empire ; what weapons they did have were confiscated in the interests of eradicating that part of the population . <PARA> this is misleading . jews were prohibited from owning guns and disarmed . overall , however , gun control laws passed by the nazis in 1938 actually loosened firearms restrictions that had been in force since the end of world war i . <PARA> gun ownership was banned outright for all german citizens in 1919 . a 1928 revision of the law lifted the ban , while still requiring individuals to obtain permits to own , sell , carry , or manufacture firearms . according to stephen halbrook , author of gun control in the third reich : disarming the jews and ‘ enemies of the state ’ ( independence institute , 2013 ), the nazis used the extant law when they came to power in 1933 to revoke the permits of communists , jews , and other “ undesirables ,” and disarm them . the first gun law actually enacted under nazi rule , the german weapons act of 1938 , eased some of the permit requirements ( those on rifles and ammunition , though not on handguns ), and lowered the legal age for the possession of firearms , but also forbade jews , specifically , from manufacturing or selling arms . <PARA> the regulations against jews ’ possession of weapons , enacted later that year , prohibited jews from possessing or carrying any kind of weapon at all . <PARA> so , while the nazis ultimately favored loosening gun restrictions on the german population as a whole , the disarmament of jews and other targeted minority populations was an essential feature of hitler ’ s genocidal program , which included the murder of six million jews ( and millions of others deemed unworthy to live under the third reich ) between 1938 and the end of world war ii . <PARA> as in the case of the soviet union , historians disagree on how many chinese civilians perished at the hands of the communist government . one source , hong kong historian frank dikötter , estimates that as many as 45 million people were “ worked , starved or beaten to death ” in china between 1948 and 1952 . other sources place the death toll at closer to one million . <PARA> the claim that china “ established gun control in 1935 ” appears to have been plucked from mid - air . according to lethal laws , a 1912 law made it illegal to possess or import rifles , cannons , or explosives without a permit . the security administration punishment act of 1957 took the additional step of making it illegal to make , purchase , or possess firearms or ammunition without the government ’ s permission — though by that time at least a million “ class enemies ” had already died in the name of mao zedong ’ s cultural revolution . <PARA> according to the center for justice and accountability , well over 100 , 000 indigenous mayans were indeed systematically murdered by the guatemalan government between 1960 and 1996 ( concurrent with the guatemala civil war ). it should be noted , however , guatemala ’ s stringent gun control laws , which required expensive , hard - to - obtain permits for carrying firearms , predated the 1960s by some forty years . for the most part it would have been unnecessary for the government to confiscate weapons from their intended victims , however , given that ( as kopel points out ) firearms were too costly for mayan peasants to obtain in the first place . <PARA> ugandan dictator idi amin is indeed considered responsible for the massacre of at least 300 , 000 civilians in his own country , most of them members of christian tribes loyal to his predecessor , milton obote . rather than being rounded up for extermination , amin ’ s victims were typically murdered on the spot by roving bands of soldiers . <PARA> before obote , uganda ’ s gun control laws ( dating from 1955 ) allowed the private ownership of weapons by permit only , and applicants were required to prove their “ fitness ” to carry firearms . obote ’ s government rewrote the law in 1969 , instituting a total , nationwide ban on the ownership and possession of weapons except for government officials and individuals who were granted special exemptions . kopel reports that the law changed again in 1970 , under amin , essentially reverting to a version of the 1955 law requiring permits and proof of fitness for gun ownership , but by that time , presumably , a large percentage of the guns in private hands had already been confiscated . <PARA> the actual estimates are that between 1 . 5 and 3 million cambodians , including about a half - million members of ethnic minority groups , were slaughtered by the communist khmer rouge between 1975 and 1979 . although the dictatorship enacted no gun laws itself , there were gun control measures on the books dating from 1920 and 1938 that required the licensing of firearms and limited their ownership to hunters . <PARA> according to the small arms survey of the graduate institute of international studies , the khmer rouge went about disarming the cambodian public — and arming itself — via a program of gun confiscation : <PARA> this simply isn ’ t true , and not just because historians still quibble over the exact numbers of those killed . tens of millions of people became victims of genocide in the twentieth century because they were members of groups targeted for eradication for reasons of ethnicity , religion , or ideology by ruthless military dictatorships . more often than not , these massacres were preceded by ( or concurrent with ) concerted efforts to disarm the targeted populations , a task obviously made easier by the existence of gun registration requirements . but to say those millions died because of gun control is an abuse of the facts and logic . <PARA> in case it isn ’ t obvious , this item is categorically different from all the others on the list in that it claims that the establishment of gun control resulted in a higher violent crime rate in a country rather than a mass extermination . as we have demonstrated previously ( because this set of assertions about gun laws australia has made the social media rounds separately from the rest of the text ), it is false . <PARA> ironically , it also stands as a counter - example disproving the main thesis of the overall text , namely that gun control leads to mass exterminations . twenty years after strict national gun control laws were enacted in australia , the country remains genocide - free . <PARA> not so . this urban legend of world war ii based on an alleged quote from japanese admiral isoroku yamamoto (“ you cannot invade mainland united states . there would be a rifle behind each blade of grass .”) was debunked in 2009 by factcheck . org . although the quote has long circulated , online and off , no one has ever been able to cite a source to substantiate it . as world war ii historian donald m . goldstein told the web site , “ as of today it is bogus until someone can cite when and where [ it was said ].” <PARA> based on the actual evidence at hand , we find it reasonable to conclude that gun confiscations , facilitated by laws requiring the registration and / or licensing of firearms , played a crucial role in the carrying out of twentieth - century genocides . however , gun control per se — properly defined as a set of laws regulating gun ownership that can range from minimally restrictive to outright prohibitive — is neither a cause nor even a reliable predictor of mass exterminations , whereas the presence of a repressive military dictatorship most certainly is .
false	on 18 july 2018 , the twitter account “ chicago 1 ray ” posted an old photograph of president trump and john f . kennedy , jr . ( the son of the late 35th president ), along with a statement ostensibly published by the younger kennedy in the june 1999 issue of george magazine about how donald trump would make a great president if he ever decided to give up his billionaire lifestyle : <PARA> this statement was not published in the june 1999 issue of george magazine , nor was it made by john f . kennedy , jr . our attempt to locate the origins of this quotation turned up no credible references to it prior to this 17 july 2018 tweet . it did not appear in any news coverage of trump ’ s 2016 presidential run , nor of his subsequent election victory . <PARA> we also examined the june 1999 issue of george magazine and found that it contained no mention of donald trump at all . john f . kennedy , jr . launched the magazine in 1995 and served as the publication ’ s editor - in - chief until his death on 16 july 1999 . the june issue from that latter year featured actor liam neeson on the cover , articles about how the u . s . had gone “ gun crazy ,” war in yugoslavia , and a closing segment that posed the hypothetical question : “ what if [ er actor ] noah wyle were president ?”: <PARA> ( the issue of george that we perused had one page missing , which included john f . kennedy jr .’ s “ letter from the editor .” we reached out to a few members of the magazine ’ s editorial board to confirm that the statement in question did not appear in the letter from the editor .) <PARA> jfk jr . and donald trump did have a social relationship , as demonstrated by this meme ’ s utilizing a genuine photograph of the two attending a new york knicks basketball game in march 1999 . in fact , michael berman , one of kennedy jr .’ s former business partners , said kennedy once quipped that trump , not himself , should run for president : <PARA> however , we found no record of john kennedy jr ’ s having issued a glowing endorsement of trump ’ s political savvy such as the one presented in this meme . <PARA> even if john f . kennedy , jr . had written something even vaguely similar , he likely would not have rendered the word “ democrats ” with the “ rats ” portion capitalized . kennedy never officially threw his hat into the political ring , but he did introduce his uncle , sen . edward kennedy , at the democratic national convention in 1988 .
false	origins : the premise of the bachelor was a simple one : twenty - five women from a variety of backgrounds <PARA> competed for the affections of alex michel , a 31 - year - old harvard - educated management consultant . over the course of the show , michel spent time with the contestants in groups and on individual dates . <PARA> at the end of each episode , michel narrowed the bevy of beauties at a “ rose ceremony .” the jilted ones sometimes walked away in tears ; one hyperventilated in the third episode and required medical treatment . nevertheless , the field was ruthlessly winnowed down week after week . <PARA> the final segment came down to alex ’ s making a choice between two women : 23 - year - old amanda marsh of chanute , kansas , and 29 - year - old trista rehn , a pediatric physical therapist and dancer for the nba ’ s miami heat . michel chose marsh , and although he showed her an engagement ring , there was no proposal . he asked her to move to california to live with him , saying “ i think we have even further that we can go before we walk down the aisle together . i want to make sure that we feel the same way about each other outside of the fantasy world of mansions and limousines .” <PARA> cynics wonder if things will work out for michel and marsh the same way they did for rick rockwell and nurse darva conger , who wed on live tv moments after they met on who wants to marry a millionaire ? that marriage instantly unraveled ; neither party now has much good to say about the other , and reports subsequently emerged that rockwell had once threatened an ex - girlfriend to the extent that she sought a restraining order to keep him away from her . <PARA> the e - mail hoax now embroiling the bachelor began innocently enough : on thursday , 25 april 2002 , the day the final episode was to air , bachelor fan jeffrey sahrbeck e - mailed fellow harvard alumnus alex michel to wish him well . michel replied : <PARA> great to hear from you . i ’ m glad you like the show . <PARA> i ’ m a little worried that the schedule change has confused people , so i have a special request for you . i ’ m trying to do a little last - minute guerrilla marketing . would you be willing to send an email to your friends reminding them that the finale is tonight from 8 - 10 and encouraging them to forward the email and spread the word ?

false	if any of you out there are my friends , i ask you out of the kindness of my heart to repost this . if you ’ re not my friend , i ask you search for the source compassion in your soul and repost this anyway . more importantly , if you ’ re in a position to , do something about it . <PARA> this is about california legislation being passed to exterminate pit bulls . if it passes in california , it could be on it ’ s way to anywhere . someone has to try to make a difference ... what if it were your pet ? <PARA> it would be great if myspace could be used for something good other than getting dates . please pass the word along and post this ... so as many people can see this as possible . <PARA> origins : reacting to a number of horrific attacks by pit bulls , including the june 2005 death of 12 - year - old nicholas faibish , the june 2005 facial mauling of 8 - year - old annette rojas , and the june 2001 mauling of 10 - year - old shawn jones , in 2005 the california legislature considered and then passed a bill that gave local governments the power to dictate spaying and neutering policies for specific breeds of dogs . the bill , sb 861 , was introduced by sen . jackie speier ( d - hillsborough ), passed by both houses , approved by the governor on 7 october , and chaptered ( chapter 668 , statutes of 2005 ) by the secretary of state on that same <PARA> sb 861 does not give local jurisdictions the authority to ban specific breeds or to require the extermination of certain types of dogs — there is nothing in the bill that bestows upon local governments the power to round up pit bulls in their jurisdictions and have them put to sleep . ergo , what is being decried in the e - mailed call to arms (“ california legislation being passed to exterminate pit bulls ”) isn ’ t the case , so those worrying that numerous beloved family pets are about to be dragged from the bosom of their adoring families and put to death can heave a sigh of relief and move on to other things . <PARA> yet some pet owners fear sb 861 is the thin edge of the wedge , that it prepares the way for greater restrictions to be placed on american pit bull terriers or even the eventual demise of the breed . some of them tried to reverse the law through a referendum but failed to raise enough signatures by the january 2006 deadline . <PARA> the e - mailed and myspace ’ d alert , which claims the california legislature is contemplating a bill to have all the state ’ s pit bulls put down , began in february 2006 likely as a misunderstanding of the rhetoric used in the failed run at overturning sb 861 . the term “ extermination of the breed ” was thrown about by concerned pet owners during that effort , and we surmise that whoever wrote the e - mail ’ s “ california legislation being passed to exterminate pit bulls ” phrasing mistakenly parsed “ exterminate the breed ” ( a pithy phrase used to describe the possibility of the breed ’ s dying out if spay / neuter programs were universal , resulting in no new american pit bull terriers coming into the world ) as meaning the government was going to cause every pit bull to be put down . <PARA> barbara “ misread ” mikkelson

false	the 13 february 2016 death of supreme court justice antonin scalia immediately sparked hot political debate and speculation , which hadn ’ t abated by the time the white house announced that president barack obama would not be attending his funeral : <PARA> the white house press circuit was immediately abuzz with questions about the president ’ s decision . white house press secretary josh earnest was asked whether obama ’ s plans “ include golfing ”: <PARA> president obama ’ s decision to not attend the actual funeral was endorsed by people close to scalia ’ s family : <PARA> whelan told the new york times that for catholics , “ a funeral mass is first and foremost a funeral , not an event of state .” the article suggested that the possibility of disruption was a key factor in the white house ’ s decision to have vice president joe biden attend in his stead : <PARA> the decision not to attend scalia ’ s funeral was not without precedent . as nbc noted , four out of the past seven funerals for a supreme court justice have had either the president or the vice president in attendance ( which means nearly half of them didn ’ t ): <PARA> “ dying this suddenly on the bench is the exception , not the rule , for the justices in the twentieth century ,” washington and lee university law professor todd peppers told cbs : <PARA> it is not out of the ordinary that president obama decided not to attend justice scalia ’ s funeral services , instead paying his respects the day before . the political rumor mill worked overtime , however : before long , a story was circulating ( without any evidence ) that obama wasn ’ t going to the funeral because he had decided to play golf instead : <PARA> in actuality , the president spent that weekend reading through lengthy dossiers and job histories of potential candidates for scalia ’ s replacement , according to his press secretary . <PARA> president obama did not appear to have disregarded any traditions in the way he paid his respects to scalia . scalia ’ s catholicism and the tone of the event appeared to have been a considerable factor in who attended the funeral , as the catholic church discourages distractions from the solemnity of mass , and the presence of the president would undeniably have affected the ceremony .
unproven	huma abedin , a u . s .- born muslim of indian and pakistani parentage , has served for more than a decade as a top aide to hillary clinton , though for much of that time was relatively unknown to the american public . all that changed beginning in 2011 when her husband , congressman anthony weiner ( d - new york ), was forced to resign from the u . s . house of representatives due to a sexting scandal , and in 2016 when she was thrust into the limelight by an fbi investigation into hillary clinton ’ s use of a private e - mail server while at the state department . as clinton was running for president at the time , abedin became the target of partisan attacks aimed at weakening her employer ’ s candidacy . <PARA> on 24 october 2016 , an eight - and - a - half - minute video was uploaded to the highly - trafficked youtube channel “ anonymous ” purporting to prove that huma abedin , estranged wife of disgraced former congressman anthony weiner and longtime aide to democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton , has “ undeniable ties to terrorists and 9 / 11 funders .” it accrued more than 2 million views in under a week , resulting in a flash - flood of queries about it to our inbox . <PARA> neither the video nor its content was new , however , nor were they created by the hacktivist group anonymous . the video was originally posted on 11 september 2016 to a youtube channel called “ leaked uploads .” it , in turn , closely follows the text of an article posted approximately 10 days before that in a subreddit populated by donald trump supporters . both the text and video appear to have been created by the same individual , a user who goes by the handle “ invadepro .” <PARA> here is an excerpt from the text : <PARA> as we mentioned above , none of these allegations are new . we ’ ll review the main charges , beginning with abedin ’ s biographical information , in a moment , but it ’ s worth pointing out at the outset that before she could serve as hillary clinton ’ s deputy chief of staff at the state department , abedin underwent a security clearance requiring , among other things , vetting of her personal and professional history to establish her loyalty to the united states and “ freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion .” while we would not argue that the clearance process is infallible , nor that information could not subsequently come to light that might change the assessment , we think it likely that the investigators charged with the task have better research tools available to them than does the average internet user . <PARA> it ’ s true that huma abedin was born in kalamazoo , michigan , in 1976 to muslim parents , syed zainul abedin ( born in india ) and saleha mahmood abedin ( born in what is now pakistan ). in 1978 , the family moved to saudi arabia , where her parents pursued academic careers and huma abedin spent most of her childhood and teenage years . she returned to the united states to study journalism at george washington university in 1994 . in 1996 she was hired as a white house intern assigned to first lady hillary clinton , for whom she has worked off and on ever since . she became clinton ’ s top aide during the latter ’ s senate campaign in 2000 , served as deputy chief of staff when clinton was secretary of state from 2009 through 2013 , and as vice chairwoman of clinton ’ s 2016 presidential campaign . <PARA> it ’ s also true that from 1996 through 2008 , abedin was listed as an assistant editor of the journal of muslim minority affairs , an academic journal founded by her father and taken over by her mother after syed abedin ’ s death in 1993 . the claim that the journal is owned by the muslim world league , an organization alleged to promote an extreme form of islam known as wahhabism , is false , however . the journal is owned by the institute of muslim minority affairs , a scholarly organization also founded by huma abedin ’ s father whose mission is studying muslims in non - muslim countries . any implication that the peer - reviewed journal , written by and for academics , is somehow “ radical ” is a misrepresentation , according to sources interviewed for a 25 august 2016 article in the washington post : <PARA> in point of fact , huma abedin never literally worked at the journal of muslim affairs at all , according to a spokesperson for the clinton campaign , who said she was “ just a figurehead and not actually on staff .” <PARA> the video attempts to link the abedin family to terrorism via their connection with abdullah omar naseef , a saudi arabian professor who was also secretary - general of the muslim world league between 1982 and 1992 . naseef , who worked ( and still works ) at the same university where syed abedin taught , helped launch the institute of muslim minority affairs , and for a time sat on the advisory board of the journal . the video provides no evidence that abdullah omar naseef “ funded al - qaeda ” or any other terror groups , however . it simply asserts that he did based on his authorization of a refugee relief fund in 1988 that later developed ties with al - qaeda . the washington post explains : <PARA> another dubious connection cited in the video is huma abedin ’ s membership in the muslim student association while she attended george washington university . as it happens , two years after abedin graduated and left the university , a young man named anwar al - awlaki arrived , joined that same muslim student association , and served as a school chaplain . al - awlaki , you may recall , was later identified as an al - qaeda recruiter and killed in a u . s . drone strike in 2011 . but the fact that each of them belonged , at different times , to the same campus religious organization does not mean they have anything in common other than being muslim . <PARA> the video also links the national muslim student association to the muslim brotherhood , but apart from the fact that the latter helped establish the former more than 50 years ago , the claim that the two organizations are actively affiliated isn ’ t supported by evidence . <PARA> most of these allegations first surfaced in 2012 , when michele bachmann and other conservative republicans launched a campaign denouncing “ muslim extremists ” — huma adebin among them — who had supposedly infiltrated the u . s . government . the backlash against these unfounded charges transcended partisanship . among those who condemned bachmann ’ s characterization of abedin was then - speaker of the house john boehner , whom politico quoted as saying : <PARA> usa today quoted then - house intelligence committee chairman mike rogers , also a republican , speaking in abedin ’ s defense as follows : <PARA> and gop senator from arizona ( and former presidential candidate ) john mccain summed up the consensus among members of both the house and senate :

month fall in the national debt is also significant when measured against the size of the overall economy . <PARA> national debt — the basics <PARA> the national debt is , in brief , the total value of what the federal government owes , and is made up of accumulated annual deficits ( when the government spends more than it receives in taxes and other income ). it is made up of “ public debt ” and “ intragovernmental holdings .” public debt is , essentially , debt held by sources outside the central government . intragovernmental holdings are debts between agencies within the federal government , in the form of government trust funds , such as social security trust funds . <PARA> national debt — the numbers <PARA> according to figures published by the treasury department ’ s bureau of fiscal services on the treasurydirect web site , the national debt was $ 19 . 84 trillion on 27 july 2017 ( not 30 july , as stated by truth division . on 20 january , it was $ 19 . 95 trillion . <PARA> that shows a fall of $ 102 . 37 billion , or 0 . 51 percent , over a period of 131 business days . to set that in context , we analyzed national debt data stretching back to 12 july 1993 , and examined every 131 - day period in the last 24 years . you can download a spreadsheet containing all the relevant data here . <PARA> debt - to - gdp ratio <PARA> the national debt , however , is best viewed with reference to the overall economy . if two countries have about the same national debt , the one with the smaller economy will likely be more constrained in its spending , whereas the larger economy — despite having the same level of debt — will be less affected in terms of economic and fiscal policy . <PARA> a good way of checking this is to compare the size of the debt to the size of the economy , measured as gdp ( gross domestic product ). gdp is the combined market value of all goods and services produced in a given jurisdiction ( in this case , the united states ). this comparison between the size of the national debt and the size of the economy is known as the debt - to - gdp ratio . <PARA> while the treasury department publishes the national debt for every business day , gdp is only published on a quarterly basis ( once every three months ). in order to compare the debt - to - gdp ratio on 27 july with the same figure on inauguration day , we have to get a little bit creative . <PARA> for example , we know that the united states gdp was $ 18 . 9 trillion at the end of december 2016 ( the end of the fourth quarter ), according to figures published by the bureau of economic analysis . <PARA> we also know that the national debt on 30 december 2016 was $ 19 . 98 trillion , so the estimated debt - to - gdp ratio on that date was 105 . 67 percent . in other words , the debts of the united states federal government were 5 . 67 percent bigger than the size of the unites states economy ( when measured by gdp ). <PARA> at the end of the first quarter of 2017 ( the end of march ), gdp was $ 19 . 06 trillion . and we know that on 31 march , the national debt was $ 19 . 85 trillion , meaning the debt - to - gdp ratio was 104 . 14 percent — a healthier number than at the end of december . but to estimate gdp for all the days in between 30 december and 31 march ( including 20 january , inauguration day ) we have to cheat a little bit . you can read more about our methodology by downloading this spreadsheet , but here ’ s what our estimates revealed : <PARA> causes <PARA> the truth division , a conservative , openly pro - trump web site , clearly attributes this decline in the national debt to the president , claiming he and his administration are “ undoing the government ’ s rampant spending ” and “ keeping his promises regarding fiscal responsibility ”. however , the article does not cite any examples of actions taken by donald trump which would support this conclusion . <PARA> jared bernstein , a senior fellow at the center on budget and policy priorities and former economic adviser to vice president joe biden , dismissed any claims that president trump is responsible : <PARA> instead , bernstein told us , the cause of the drop in the debt is simple — the federal debt ceiling that has been in place since march 2017 . <PARA> eventually , bernstein says , the debt ceiling will have to be lifted , and the payments that had been delayed will cause the national debt to increase once again . <PARA> that pattern can be seen in this chart , which shows the national debt from january 2011 up to the end of july 2017 . there are four flat lines showing four periods during which the debt ceiling was frozen : from may to august 2011 ; may to october 2013 ; march to october 2015 ; and the ongoing period since march 2017 . <PARA> conclusion <PARA> the truth division article accurately describes the extent to which the national debt fell between the inauguration of donald trump in january 2017 and the end of july of the same year . and it rightly describes this fall as “ surprising ”, since it ranks among the very largest 131 - day declines in the national debt since july 1993 , both in absolute and percentage terms . <PARA> similarly , the decline in both components of the national debt — public debt and intragovernmental holdings — was highly significant between 20 january and 27 july 2017 , both in absolute and percentage terms , and as we have shown , the national debt has fallen by an estimated 2 . 25 percent since inauguration day — even when measured against the size of the overall unites states economy . whether or not any actions or decisions made by donald trump have caused or contributed to these historically remarkable declines in the debt is a question that goes beyond the scope of this particular fact check . <PARA> unfortunately , the national debt resumed its upward march in august 2017 and by mid - august 2018 stood at about $ 21 . 3 trillion ( up $ 1 . 4 trillion since inauguration day ), so the early 2017 drop has not proved to be a long - term trend . <PARA> a spreadsheet containing all the data relevant to this article can be downloaded here .

true	this anecdote about an unusual end to a soccer game in cup competition references an incident that took place during a final group match between barbados and grenada for the 1994 shell caribbean cup : <PARA> the barbados team had to win the match by at least two goals in order to face trinidad and tobago in the finals ; anything less and their opponent in that match , grenada , would advance to the next round instead . the rules in effect at the time specified that if the score were tied at the end of regulation play , the match would continue into a sudden death overtime , and the first team to score during the overtime period would be considered a two - goal winner . <PARA> as detailed above , barbados was leading 2 - 0 well into the second half of play when a goal credited to grenada late in the game narrowed the score to 2 - 1 . barbados realized with three minutes to play that they were unlikely to score again in the time remaining and deliberately kicked the ball into their own goal to tie the match at 2 - 2 and force an overtime period , a stratagem that touched off a bizarre finish to the game which had grenada desperately trying to untie the score by kicking the ball into either goal . <PARA> as described by simon gardiner in his 2005 book , sports law : <PARA> the following clip provides a video summary of the same story :

mixture	two days before 6 november 2018 midterm elections in which georgians went to the polls to choose a new governor , the right - wing blog breitbart . com published a headline suggesting democratic candidate stacey abrams had admitted that “ her plans may require georgians to ‘ turn their guns in '”: <PARA> the headline , unsurprisingly , was a bit of an exaggeration that was undermined by the underlying story . abrams , a former state representative and gubernatorial hopeful who is suing for a run - off after a bitter and close election against former secretary of state brian kemp , said she supported a ban on a particular category of guns ( assault weapons ), but she did not say she supports a broader gun ban that would require georgians to part with all guns , as the headline implied . <PARA> during a november 2018 interview with cnn ’ s jake tapper , abrams stated that “ i believe that we have to ban assault weapons in the state of georgia . but what i ’ m saying is , as part of my leadership , i ’ m going to work across the aisle , and we ’ re going to have a conversation about how we accomplish this .” possible options , abrams said , could include the grandfathering in of weapons already possessed by citizens , owners turning banned guns over to authorities , or gun buybacks : <PARA> when pressed by tapper on whether she supported the confiscation of guns banned by the proposed legislation , abrams maintained that the introduction of the legislation was about “ starting a conversation ,” not about expecting it to be passed in every detail as originally submitted . abrams also claimed to support the second amendment , asserting that she knows how to shoot guns and hunt with them . <PARA> as a member of georgia ’ s state house of representatives , abrams in 2016 co - sponsored hb 731 , a bill that would : <PARA> if the bill had become law , it would have given any georgian who owned such a weapon as of 1 july 2016 a deadline of 31 october 2016 to either “ render it permanently inoperable or such that it is no longer an assault weapon or large capacity magazine ” or surrender it to the georgia bureau of investigation for destruction . <PARA> we reached out to abrams ’ campaign for comment and were directed to the 30 october 2018 episode of the abc morning talk show the view , in which abrams reiterated her support for gun owner rights but stated she believed in background checks , a three - day waiting period , and that “ those who commit domestic violence and stalking should not have access to weapons .” in response to questions from co - host meghan mccain , abrams declared : <PARA> when mccain pressed abrams on whether she supported “ rounding up ” the popular guns from their owners , abrams averred only that a “ conversation ” should take place around how existing guns should be dealt with in the event of an assault weapons ban : <PARA> the georgia gubernatorial election was beset by allegations of voter suppression that targeting thousands of primarily black voters . kemp , who as secretary of state oversaw the election in which he took a narrow lead , has been pressuring abrams to concede . she has declined to do so , filing a lawsuit instead over rejected ballots .

false	one of the castle spires in the background of the little mermaid promotional artwork bears an unmistakable resemblance to a penis , so much so that many people are unwilling to dismiss the drawing as mere accident or coincidence . rumors started circulating shortly after the release of the videocassette edition of the little mermaid that the phallic object had been deliberately drawn as a last act of defiance by a disgruntled disney artist who was miffed at being notified that he would be laid off at the conclusion of the project . <PARA> the plain truth is that the resemblance between the castle spire and a penis was purely accidental , and it was drawn by an artist who was neither disgruntled nor about to be dismissed . <PARA> first of all , the artist who created the video cover art did not work for disney itself , thus he was neither “ disgruntled with disney ” nor “ about to be fired .” we questioned the artist , who also drew artwork for little mermaid theatrical advertising , pop - ups , greeting cards , happy meal boxes , and cds . the theatrical posters were done before the original release of the film , but the video cover art was not created until a few months before the home video version hit the market . rushed to complete the video artwork ( featuring towers that were rather phallic to begin with ), the artist hurried through the background detail ( at “ about four in the morning ”) and inadvertently drew one spire that bore a rather close resemblance to a penis : <PARA> the artist himself didn ’ t notice the resemblance until a member of his youth church group heard about the controversy on talk radio and called him at his studio with the news . <PARA> the later laserdisc release of the film was issued with a cover containing an altered version of the infamous spire . contrary to common belief , the phallic - like spire did not make its first appearance with the cover to the home video version ; the same background drawing of the castle , with the same spires , appeared in promotional material and posters that accompanied the film ’ s original theatrical release . the video cover does differ slightly from the original version , but the castle shown in the background is the same in both versions . ( later versions of the laserdisc cover were altered to remove the offending spire .) <PARA> the alleged “ phallic symbol ” in the little mermaid ’ s artwork went undetected by the general public for about a year while the film was in the theatrical release . shortly after entertainment weekly ran a story about the offending artwork in mid - 1990 , the rumor became widespread when machelle couch of mesa , arizona , complained to disney and a phoenix supermarket chain ( bashas ’) about the phallus on the cover of the little mermaid . bashas ’ pulled the videos from their shelves ( but returned them less than 24 hours later ), and the story of the “ penis ” cover was soon widely disseminated by the media .

mixture	david garrow ’ s dense and rigorous 2017 book profile of barack obama ’ s pre - presidential years , titled rising star : the making of barack obama , was in all respects an extremely deep dive into obama ’ s early life , as recounted in a politico review : <PARA> among the tidbits reported on heavily by various news outlets at the time was the “ unpublished policy manuscript ” barack obama wrote with his friend and harvard law classmate rob fischer sometime around april 1991 . the manuscript , titled “ race and rights rhetoric ,” was written for harvard law professor martha minnow ’ s law and society class , and the two young men hoped it would become a chapter of a book . that chapter would have broached the idea that talking about minority rights in terms of “ universal rights ” could be counterproductive and instead suggested the possibility that these discussions could be more productive if framed in the more commonly held american notions of “ equality of opportunity ,” as described by garrow : <PARA> as an example of this line of thought , obama and fischer described what they called the “ unfounded optimism of the average american ” and used donald trump as an extreme caricature of what some people ’ s conception of upward mobility looked like , as summarized ( with direct excerpts ) by garrow : <PARA> because of the reference to donald trump , barack obama ’ s presidential successor , some news outlets highlighted this excerpt , suggesting in somewhat misleading headlines that obama was praising trump as an archetypical example of the american dream : <PARA> while some of these articles clarified obama and fischer ’ s meaning in their text , the headline claims presented were a mischaracterization of obama and fisher ’ s argument , which was a call for pragmatism in discussions of racial equality and progress . as one example of this pragmatic approach , obama and fischer suggested reframing the quest for racial equality as part of the american concept of equality of opportunity . the invocation of donald trump ’ s name was not , as implied by headlines , used to provide an example of the “ american dream ,” but rather an example of the “ unfounded optimism of the average american ” ( i . e ., the expectation that they or their children would become economically well - off someday ) — a concept obama and fischer suggested could be tapped into as a way to bring about more fruitful discussions of racial equality .

unproven	the history of race relations in america includes many ( unfortunately true ) tales of black entertainers and athletes whose talents were avidly capitalized upon and enjoyed by white business people and audiences , while they themselves were treated as second - class citizens . considered good enough to entertain millions of white americans on ball fields and stages throughout the country , far too often these performers were nonetheless not considered good enough to share lodgings , restaurants , or recreational facilities with whites and had to make do with ( typically far inferior ) separate accommodations . and black customers who paid to see these performers were usually treated in like fashion , relegated to sitting in segregated ( and less desirable ) sections of the audience — if they were allowed to attend at all . <PARA> perhaps nowhere was this disparity symbolized more than in the gambling mecca of las vegas , where black entertainers ( primarily singers ) regularly entertained casino and resort guests in hotel showrooms and lounges , but oftimes weren ’ t allowed to stay in those very same hotels , or eat in their restaurants . black entertainers weren ’ t even welcomed as casino patrons , as sportswriter roger kahn documented when budding baseball superstar willie mays of the new york giants was booted from a vegas casino floor for the offense of “ standing while black ”: <PARA> in the world of urban legendry , the paramount example of this form of discrimination is an oft - repeated anecdote that a las vegas hotel once went to the lengths of completely draining their swimming pool after singer / dancer dorthy dandridge ( the first african - american actress to be nominated for an academy award for best actress ) dared to dip her toe in it : <PARA> it ’ s not hard to see why people might believe that tale , especially in the light of such famously documented instances as a florida motel manager ’ s pouring acid into a “ whites only ” swimming pool in order to frighten black anti - segregation protesters into leaving it : <PARA> but did the vegas pool - draining incident actually happen ? and to dorothy dandridge in particular ? <PARA> the first thing we note is that , in true urban legend fashion , this story has also been told about multiple other black entertainers who worked clubs and showrooms on the vegas strip : <PARA> we also note that ( in similar urban legend fashion ) the incidence of specifically citing dandridge as the protagonist in this tale increased significantly after the scenario was dramatized in the 1999 hbo film introducing dorothy dandridge , starring halle berry : <PARA> finally , we note that tellings of this legend generally stem from people who say they heard about the event second - hand ( rather than witnessing it themselves ), and those tellings don ’ t necessarily jibe with reality — as in the case of harry belafonte : <PARA> at this point in our narrative , the best we can say is that the pool - draining tale may or may not be true , and it may or may not have involved someone other than dorothy dandridge . so let ’ s turn our attention to why it supposedly happened . <PARA> what ’ s reflected in many tellings of this tale ( including the hbo film about dandridge referenced above ) is the implication that even a small portion of a black person ’ s body touching the water of a whites - only swimming pool was considered to have so thoroughly contaminated that water as to require its complete removal and replacement , lest white swimmers flee in disgust : <PARA> however , a tactic commonly employed by segregationists who wanted to deny the use of facilities to unwanted , assertive blacks ( especially in parts of the u . s . where segregated facilities were not enforced by law ) was to suddenly declare some nebulous malfunction had rendered them “ out of order ” ( a situation which would usually be quickly remedied just as soon as the unwanted guests gave up and departed ). this tactic could , at times , extend to the draining of pools to render them temporarily ( or in some cases , permanently ) unusable : <PARA> this thought brings another possible scenario to mind . what if a high - profile black entertainer used , attempted to use , or evinced an interest in using a vegas hotel swimming pool that management preferred remain limited to whites ( so as not to drive away white customers who were dead set against sharing such a facility with blacks )? it might be a bit awkward from a publicity standpoint for hotel management to publicly hustle such a celebrity away from the pool ( or even to privately inform that person that he or she was not welcome there ), but that problem could be temporarily headed off by fabricating a reason for suddenly draining the pool , thereby making it unavailable to everyone ( and covering the real reason for its unavailability ). when said celebrity finished his or her engagement and left town ( or moved on to another hotel ), the pool “ maintenance ” problem could be quickly remedied . <PARA> indeed , this scenario is the one most frequently cited in discussions of this legend — that a hotel pool was deliberately drained not because dandridge had “ contaminated ” its waters , but as a preventive measure to ensure she didn ’ t try to use it : <PARA> of course , a hotel ’ s putting their swimming pool out of action ( especially in the desert heat of las vegas , where such amenities are expected and prized by guests ) and inconveniencing all their customers for an indefinite period of time in order to deal with a single - person problem sounds like self - defeating overkill . which is why , perhaps , at least some dandridge biographies suggest that a vegas hotel deterred her from using their pool merely by threatening to drain it : <PARA> it ’ s not a stretch to assert that dorothy dandridge ( and / or other black entertainers ) were at some time explicitly barred from using swimming pools at las vegas strip hotels in the early 1950s , or that they may have been tacitly discouraged from doing so ( by means up to and including threats of pool drainage ). but given the dearth of first - hand accounts and contemporaneous reporting , we can ’ t definitively say that any particular hotel ever proactively drained their pool to keep her from using it , much less emptied all the water merely because she dipped a toe in it .
mixture	the student union at the university of manchester in england received unwanted attention online following reports of what was described as a “ clapping ban ” during some of their events . <PARA> the union voted on 27 september 2018 to “ swap audible clapping out for british sign language ( bsl ) clapping ,” in which participants wave their hands , during “ democratic events ” related to student union policy . <PARA> “[ clapping ] can trigger issues for students who have autism , sensory issues , and deafness . and it can discourage them from being present at those events ,” said sara khan , the union ’ s liberation and access officer . <PARA> while the move was mocked on social media , critics failed to point out that according to a union statement , the encouragement of bsl clapping had a limited scope : <PARA> the group also said that contrary to media “ inaccuracies ,” they did not plan to institute a ban on audible clapping : <PARA> the country ’ s national union of students ( nus ), an umbrella organization comprising student unions from more than 600 such groups , has reportedly used bsl at some events since 2015 .
false	press secretary sarah huckabee sanders frequently made headlines in 2017 in articles both praising and criticizing her performance . so when an anecdote describing a witty exchange sanders reportedly had with an msnbc reporter over the location of trump ’ s tax returns , many viewers mistook it for a genuine news item : <PARA> however , this exchange never occurred . <PARA> this item has been circulating via email , internet forums , and social media since at least april 2017 and it was originally attributed to sanders ’ s predecessor , sean spicer : <PARA> early iterations of the joke were frequently accompanied by messages indicating that this was a fictional exchange and not a genuine news item : <PARA> if sanders ( or spicer ) truly did take part in this exchange ( which she didn ’ t ), she would have been spreading several debunked conspiracy theories about president trump ’ s predecessor , including the claims that obama didn ’ t graduate college ( he did ); that he received financial aid as a “ foreign student ” ( he did not ); that his selective service registration is “ sealed ” ( it is public ); that he visited pakistan when u . s . citizens were banned from traveling there ( he did not ); and the oft - touted ( and discredited ) theory that he was not born in the united states ( he was born in hawaii ). <PARA> we also found no news accounts documenting this nonexistent exchange with sanders ( or spicer ). since the position of press secretary has been heavily scrutinized during the trump administration , it is extremely unlikely that such an exchange would have gone unreported .

mixture	in the autumn of 2018 , president donald trump ’ s nomination of judge brett kavanaugh to serve on the u . s . supreme court dominated news cycles after three women publicly accused him of sexual assault or sexual misconduct during his high school and college years . <PARA> those women , in particular kavanaugh ’ s principal accuser dr . christine blasey ford , faced a torrent of personal attacks and malicious misinformation , but judge kavanaugh himself also came in for criticism , largely in relation to his historical consumption of alcohol and his personality , but also on the basis of his past pronouncements and suitability for a federal judgeship . <PARA> on 2 october , the anti - trump , pro - labor union facebook page “ union thugs ” posted a meme which alleged that kavanaugh , prior to his appointment as a federal judge in 2006 , was desperately lacking in trial experience and had been promoted directly from the position of law clerk to a seat on the federal bench : <PARA> this claim has two components . the first part , that kavanaugh was promoted directly from law clerk to federal judge , leaves out significant portions of kavanaugh ’ s background and professional history . the second part , that kavanaugh had never tried a case before being nominated for a judgeship in 2003 , is mostly accurate . <PARA> in june 2006 , kavanaugh was sworn in as a judge on the u . s . court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit , commonly known as the “ dc circuit .” in welcoming him into the role , then - president george w . bush said : <PARA> a few days earlier , the u . s . senate had voted 57 - 36 to confirm kavanaugh to the position , with 53 republicans and four democrats supporting his nomination , 35 democrats and one independent opposing it , and seven senators not voting . <PARA> opponents of kavanaugh ’ s confirmation had highlighted his alleged lack of experience and close ties to bush , with the late democratic icon ted kennedy saying , in a senate debate : <PARA> in referring to kavanaugh ’ s role in “ some of the most politically divisive events in recent memory ,” kennedy almost certainly meant the 2000 florida recount and independent counsel ken starr ’ s investigation into the whitewater scandal , which expanded to cover president bill clinton ’ s affair with former white house intern monica lewinsky and ultimately yielded grounds for the unsuccessful impeachment of clinton . <PARA> in the mid - 1990s , kavanaugh took part in the clinton investigations led by starr , for whom he had worked in 1992 and 1993 when starr was u . s . solicitor general . in 1999 , the new york times described kavanaugh as having been one of “ the most important lawyers on the lewinsky inquiry .” <PARA> during this period , kavanaugh controversially re - investigated the death of vince foster , clinton ’ s white house counsel , despite the fact that several official investigations had already concluded that foster shot himself to death in 1993 . ( since it took place , foster ’ s death has become the subject of rampant conspiracy theories implicating bill and hillary clinton , about which more can be read here .) <PARA> furthermore , kavanaugh was involved in writing up parts of the second half of starr ’ s eventual report to congress , which outlined the grounds for clinton ’ s impeachment . kavanaugh later expressed regret that congress had decided to publish the entire report , which included intimate details of clinton and lewinsky ’ s sexual relationship , without reviewing it in advance . <PARA> in late 2000 , kavanaugh joined the legal team of then - texas governor george w . bush as the contested results of the presidential election in florida went before the u . s . supreme court . <PARA> ‘ a law clerk promoted to a judge ’ <PARA> before his confirmation as a judge on the dc circuit in 2006 , kavanaugh had the following experience ( in reverse chronological order ): <PARA> bush first nominated kavanaugh to the dc circuit in february 2003 , but concerns over kavanaugh ’ s relative lack of experience and partisanship triggered a protracted filibuster by congressional democrats . <PARA> in 2003 , an american bar association ( aba ) committee gave kavanaugh its highest rating of “ well qualified ” for a position on the dc circuit . however , the committee re - evaluated him in 2005 and 2006 and , on the latter occasion , downgraded their rating to “ qualified .” <PARA> as the aba explained , a rating of “ qualified ” still means that “ the nominee meets the committee ’ s very high standards with respect to integrity , professional competence and judicial temperament and that the committee believes that the nominee will be able to perform satisfactorily all of the duties and responsibilities required by the high office of a federal judge .” <PARA> in 2006 , the aba committee , which is responsible for evaluating federal judicial candidates , wrote that kavanaugh “ enjoys a solid reputation for integrity , intellectual capacity , and writing and analytical ability ” and a majority of the committee ’ s 15 members rated him “ qualified ,” with a minority rating him “ well qualified ” and none of them deeming him “ not qualified .” <PARA> however , the committee outlined two major reasons why they had downgraded their endorsement of kavanaugh between 2003 and 2006 — increased concerns over his putative lack of experience as a lawyer , and new concerns over his judicial temperament , in particular his ability to remain impartial as a judge : <PARA> twelve years later , on 30 august 2018 , the aba committee ’ s 15 members voted unanimously to give kavanaugh a rating of “ well qualified ” for the position of u . s . supreme court justice , concluding : “ judge kavanaugh meets the highest standards of integrity , professional competence , and judicial temperament .” <PARA> however , after a u . s . senate judiciary committee hearing in which dr . christine blasey ford outlined her allegations of sexual assault against kavanaugh , and kavanaugh defended himself , aba president bob carlson wrote a letter on 27 september urging the senate committee to postpone any vote on confirming kavanaugh until the federal bureau of investigation had completed an investigation into the sexual assault allegations . <PARA> it ’ s clear that president bush did not promote kavanaugh directly from a law clerk to a federal judge , as the meme claims . notwithstanding his inexperience as a trial lawyer or judge , kavanaugh ’ s last clerkship ended in 1994 , nine years before bush nominated him to the dc circuit and 12 years before he was confirmed to it . in those intervening years , kavanaugh worked ( albeit almost entirely outside the courtroom ) on some high - profile cases and investigations , and at the highest levels of the executive branch . <PARA> ‘ never tried a case in a regular court ’ <PARA> it ’ s not clear what the meme means by “ regular court ,” but let ’ s take a look at kavanaugh ’ s overall courtroom and trial experience before his nomination to the dc circuit in 2003 , and his appointment in 2006 . <PARA> in july 2003 , kavanaugh responded to written questions put to him by the senate judiciary committee after his nomination by president bush . a few questions hit directly on his experience ( or lack thereof ) as a trial lawyer : <PARA> “ i have not been a trial lawyer ” is the key takeaway from these answers . by his own admission , kavanaugh had never appeared in any court below the state or federal level , and had never been the lead attorney in a trial of any kind , whether civil or criminal , which supports the “ union thugs ” statement that he “ had never tried a case .” <PARA> kavanaugh did take part in the preparation of some components of some significant court cases , and he did on a few occasions make oral arguments before the u . s . supreme court , the dc circuit itself , other federal appeals courts , and state courts . as part of his 2003 questionnaire response , kavanaugh outlined his role in some significant cases , including a couple related to the vince foster investigation and ken starr ’ s clinton probe . <PARA> despite his work on these cases , kavanaugh had not tried a case in court from start to finish by the time he was nominated by president bush in 2003 to take his place on the us court of appeals for the dc circuit . this component of the “ union thugs ” meme is therefore accurate .
true	origins : much to the world ’ s grief and dismay , former beatle john lennon was shot and killed by a mentally ill , obsessed fan on 8 december 1980 . according to lennon ’ s widow , yoko ono , more than 1 . 1 million gun - related deaths have taken place in the u . s . in the years since her husband was murdered . <PARA> ono made a similar claim in 2013 , when she tweeted that “ over 1 , 057 , 000 ” people had been killed by guns in the u . s . since john lennon ’ s death . although she did not provide a source for her information , the numbers from the u . s . centers for disease control ( cdc ) back up her claim . <PARA> according to the cdc , 620 , 525 gun - related deaths occurred between 1981 and 1998 , and another 464 , 033 deaths between 1999 and 2013 : <PARA> the cdc has not released data for 2014 yet , but if we assume that the number of gun - related deaths will be close to the numbers from the previous five years , we can reasonably estimate that there were about 32 , 500 gun related deaths in 2014 and another 32 , 500 in 2015 . when we add the cdc ’ s data to those estimates , we can see that yoko ono correctly stated that there have been more than 1 . 1 million ( 1 , 149 , 000 by our count ) gun - related deaths in the united states since the end of 1980 . <PARA> it should be noted , however , that the original claim ( and the cdc statistics ) reference all gun - related deaths , not just intentional homicides , so suicides and accidental deaths are also included in these numbers . <PARA> originally published : 8 december 2015

true	origins : used underwear that has supposedly been previously worn by schoolgirls is being offered for sale in vending machines in japan . though we don ’ t know the current price for such items , in 1993 they sold for the equivalent of us $ 50 apiece . <PARA> we ’ d read that this practice ended in 1993 and reported as much in the original of this article ( which was penned in 2001 ), but since that time numerous readers living in japan have written to say that not only haven ’ t the machines gone away , but that they ’ ve themselves seen them . <PARA> japan is home to a thriving bura - sera industry — <PARA> of which traffic in the soiled panties of schoolgirls represents only one part — with “ bura - sera ” or “ buru - sera ” the term for a specific male fascination relating to that country ’ s schoolgirls . “ buru ” is anglicized japanese ( japlish ) for “ bloomers ” and “ sera ” for “ sailor ”; the term refers to the sailor suit , the predominant style of girls ’ junior and high school uniforms . dozens , if not hundreds , of magazines are exclusively devoted to bura - sera photographs , pictures that feature girls clad in school garb , holding up their skirts to display their panties . usually in such photos the girls ’ faces are hidden , but that is not always the case . <PARA> girlish youth and innocence are considered sexy in japan , a culture with a long history of regarding women more as sex toys than as people . this obsession with untouched adolescence results in the sad sight of women in their thirties emitting girlish giggles and clutching teddy bears in an effort to maintain their appeal to the opposite sex . although it can fairly be said western society also prizes youth in a woman , there the fascination has to do more with the looks of a girl than it does with her immaturity and presumed sexual innocence . a pretty 26 - year - old who would be considered lovely in the west would in japan be viewed by many as hopelessly long in the tooth . <PARA> western society looks for firm , youthful bodies housing the attitudes of grown women — we like them young , but we don ’ t like them to act young . in the west , a teen ’ s sex appeal is dependent upon her ability to look and act much older , thus the fascination with makeup and plunging necklines , accoutrements that make her appear less of a child and more of a woman . in japan , this ideal is reversed — sexy in the land of the rising sun adds up to childlike behavior and modes of dress that express this ideal . sometimes this amounts to the adoption of clothing styles highly reminiscent of high school uniforms , but even when a girl dons an evening gown , she will strive to look like a kinderling caught parading in mom ’ s finery . likewise , childish outbursts , pouting , and tantrums are viewed as charmingly erotic because such actions work to further the violated schoolgirl image . <PARA> in a sexual culture so dominated by roricon ( japlish for “ lolita complex ”), buru - sera fetishism finds its footing . those whose way of life has taught them to lust for young girls find outlet for their interest through viewing suggestive photos of teen girls and handling items previously worn by them . <PARA> for a price , girls supplying buru - sera items for resale will don a new pair of panties at a porn shop in the morning on their way to school , then change back into their own underwear at the end of the day at the same shop , leaving its proprietor with a saleable item . girls can also turn a profit on their own used undies by offloading them to the same people . generally , <PARA> the more worn the item , the higher the price it will fetch . porn shops featuring buru - sera items also vend girls ’ used school uniforms . <PARA> there is no guarantee that all the panties marketed as having been worn by schoolgirls actually have been . such details are not scrupulously vetted ; no regulatory body checks to ensure the veracity of claims made about these items . however , it is clear that at least some of the used undies do come from teen girls , thus this “ underwear of a japanese schoolgirl ” story is no myth . <PARA> japan has a tradition of vending through machines what western society would view as unusual consumables . in addition to the many items one would typically expect to find offered for sale in this manner , porn magazines , disposable cameras , new pantyhose , horoscopes , and many other goods are routinely mechanically vended . <PARA> part of the appeal of such machines is attributable to a matter of convenience , but concern for privacy also fuels the mania . there is less chance of embarrassment in buying condoms from a machine than from a store where the sale must be rung up and bagged by a clerk . likewise , purchases of “ pink ” videos ( what in the west are termed “ blue movies ”) are less likely to be blush - producing experiences when these transactions can be effected without anyone else ’ s looking on . <PARA> there was thus a waiting market for “ schoolgirl panties ” machines , in that those looking to obtain such items would not have to brave a bura - sera shop to fulfill their desires . these mechanical points of sale appeared in 1993 in chiba city ( chiba prefecture ), in an area known for its porn magazine and adult video vending machines . almost immediately , an outcry was raised against them , but there was a problem in getting them removed : whereas sellers required licenses to distribute other types of goods , no such requirement was on the books for soiled underwear , because no one had foreseen the possibility of trade in such an item . these machines existed outside the law in the sense that no specific statute existed that could be invoked to combat them . <PARA> the solution was as creative as it is odd - sounding — the machines were countered by invoking the antique dealings law , a statute which stipulates that an antique dealer or a dealer in second - hand items must obtain permission from local authorities . lacking those permissions , the items could not be vended . <PARA> in september 1993 , three businessmen were charged with selling used panties without a permit under the provenance of this law . this supposedly ended the presence of such salespoints in that country , but like we said at the top of this piece , countless readers have since written to tell us that the machines can still be found . <PARA> barbara “ vend me your rears ” mikkelson <PARA> additional information : <PARA> teenage sex and buru - sera shops

false	a book of canonical television sitcom plots might include an entry like the following : <PARA> oddly enough , although that last entry might seem a bit goofy even for a sitcom plot , it ’ s something that has been claimed as happening in real life . the subject of the claim was singer “ mama ” cass elliot , most famous for her stint with the pop group the mamas and the papas , who related the story behind her increased vocal on many occasions , including during a 1968 interview with rolling stone : <PARA> could a knock on the head really increase a singer ’ s vocal range ? did mama cass actually experience such a phenomenon ? whether or not the answer to the first question is yes , the answer to the latter one is no . <PARA> although cass elliot apparently was hit on the head by a pipe a few months before she officially joined the mamas and the papas in late 1965 ( at least , group member michelle phillips later said she remembered such an incident ), the notion that the accident increased the upper end of her vocal range by three notes is quite suspect . elliot had been singing since she was a child and had engaged in a number of professional singing ventures ( both live performance and recording ) prior to joining the mamas and the papas , but nothing from that period evidences her possessing a lesser vocal range . her recordings with pre - mamas and papas groups such as the big 3 and the mugwumps demonstrate her to have a vocal range similar to that displayed in her work with the mamas and the papas , and other musicians who knew her during her pre - mamas and papas days attested to her already being possessed of a fine voice : <PARA> so what , then , was the origin of the “ pipe ” tale ? was it yet another fictional “ amazing - but - true ” story concocted by a publicist ? was it something cass elliot believed to be true , even if the accident in fact had no effect on her vocal range ? according to russell gilliam ( sister of michelle phillips ), the claim was a cover story cooked up after the fact to explain why , after cass had hung around and performed with the other three singers who would eventually form the mamas and the papas ( john phillips , michelle phillips , and denny doherty ) during their 1965 sojourn in the virgin islands , leader john phillips was still unwilling to accept her as a member : <PARA> author eddi fiegel expanded on the real explanation behind the pipe story in dream a little dream of me , her 2005 biography of cass elliot : <PARA> although the “ knocked in the head with a pipe ” tale may not have originated as a television sitcom plot , it featured the upbeat , positive ending of one : even the reluctant john phillips eventually acknowledged the value of cass elliot ’ s vocal abilities and personality , and she was a key element in the tremendous popularity and success that followed as the mamas and the papas turned out a string of hit records in the mid - 1960s .
unproven	unproven <PARA> examples : [ collected via facebook , october 2015 ] <PARA> origins : under a law that came into effect on 5 october 2015 retailers in england were required by law to apply a charge of 5p for all single - use plastic carrier bags ( save for exemptions provided for specific items and some small businesses ). <PARA> relevant guidelines were issued by the department for environment food & rural affairs ( defra ): <PARA> implementation of the 5p bag law was chaotic by most accounts , and the british media reported that shoppers were primarily confused or angry about the inconvenience . amid popular reactions to the new law was a 12 october 2015 facebook post ( reproduced above ), which featured a photograph of a print missive claiming that the 5p bag surcharge was illegal and couldn ’ t properly be imposed . under a ( slightly obscured ) header reading “ have your say ,” a writing titled “ law broken on 5p bags ” claimed : <PARA> the letter continued , but the remainder of its content wasn ’ t captured in the photo . that image appeared on various forums across the web , but no source , date , or publication of origin was ever included ( and all iterations were identical to the facebook post ’ s version ). the first point argued by the letter were that the 5p bag law was illegal if the carrier in question was printed with a store ’ s logo or name , as customers were conscripted to advertise for the store by merit of carrying the bags . while that objection was creative , we were unable to locate any information indicating that the 5p bag law unduly imposed upon consumers in such a fashion . no part of the law prevented shoppers from bringing unlabeled bags with them or enforced a condition by which consumers were obliged to carry branded plastic bags ( and advertise for any retailers ). in short , shoppers were free to avoid the charge by supplying their own bags or forgoing a bag altogether ; no portion of the law required anyone to carry a bag labeled “ tesco ” or “ waitrose .” related rumors claimed trolley thefts were up among consumers who resented the law : <PARA> in its second portion the letter writer objected to the 5p bag surcharge on procedural grounds , claiming that the law wasn ’ t implemented through proper channels ( adding that the government itself had “ broken the law ” in imposing it ). however , no citations for the claim were provided . given the massive media scrutiny to which the 5p bag law has been subject , it ’ s likely such an objection would have been raised by a major media outlet during their ongoing coverage of the new regulation . but despite the story ’ s popularity , the sole claim we could locate suggesting the law was improperly imposed was in a single letter to the editor . <PARA> moreover , similar laws were put into effect in wales in 2011 and scotland in 2014 . neither of those laws was challenged in the manner described in the letter , nor deemed an unreasonable or illegal burden on shoppers . <PARA> the rumor claiming the 5p bag law was illegal was widely reposted on social media , but no evidence suggested its assertions were supported . the format in which it was presented ( a photograph of something in print ) may have bolstered its authority , and letters to the editor are sometimes mistaken for articles in print when shared to social media in that fashion . but given widespread objection to the new law and its popularity in media , it remained highly unlikely that such a claim would go unreported in comprehensive coverage if its assertions were in any way legally plausible . <PARA> variations : a related rumor claimed a sign spotted in supermarket asda after the 5p bag law went into effect informed shoppers the chain “ politely insist [ ed ]” customers “ using bags from other shops ... leave the store .” <PARA> commenters noted the sign was an obvious fabrication — the slogan at the bottom (“ every little helps ”) was associated with tesco , not asda . asda advised customers on 12 october 2015 that the circulating image wasn ’ t legitimate : <PARA> first published : 13 october 2015

false	in april 2011 , online rumors surfaced to the effect that billionaire real estate mogul donald trump ( who was already being spoken of as a potential presidential contender ) might be suffering from a genetic disorder known as klinefelter syndrome . <PARA> klinefelter syndrome , also known as xxy , is caused by a redundant x chromosome in males . whereas women normally have two x chromosomes ( xx ), and men one x and one y ( xy ), klinefelter sufferers have two x and one y ( xxy ), leaving them with a variable array of symptoms including smaller - than - normal testes and abnormally low testosterone . <PARA> according to the national institutes of health : <PARA> based on that symptom list , donald trump would hardly seem to be a prima facie candidate for an xxy diagnosis . at six - foot - three , he ’ s taller than most men , but trump is the opposite of infertile ( having five children ), displays no obvious cognitive disabilities ( indeed , he succeeded in being elected to the presidency of the united states ), and is anything but quiet , sensitive , and unassertive . <PARA> however , the case for donald trump allegedly suffering from klinefelter syndrome is not based on observable symptoms , but rather on an obscure , handwritten “ yxx ” notation found on trump ’ s 1968 selective service record , which was released by thesmokinggun . com in 2011 : <PARA> despite the fact that the chromosomal anomaly associated with klinefelter is usually expressed in the medical literature as “ xxy ,” partisan bloggers such as darryl holman of horse ’ s ass chose to interpret the “ yxx ” entry on trump ’ s draft record as evidence that trump may have the syndrome : <PARA> while we suspect mr . holman was not entirely serious in speculating about trump ’ s chromosomal health , repetition is golden when it comes propagating rumors , and holman was aided and abetted by his colleague david “ goldy ” goldstein , who rehashed it in a column in the stranger : <PARA> some rumors , instead of going viral , simply fester ( sometimes for years ), and that proved to be the case with the claim that donald trump has klinefelter syndrome . it didn ’ t come up during the 2016 presidential campaign ( amazingly , given how popular fraudulent medical diagnoses were at the time ), but it did resurface amidst the post - election scramble to dig up dirt on the president - elect , in the form of a handy web graphic : <PARA> once again , however , despite an exhaustive listing of klinefelter symptoms , few actually seem to apply to donald trump , so the main point of evidence remains the “ yxx ” notation on his selective service record . is it plausible to suppose that “ yxx ” designates a chromosomal abnormality on his part ? absolutely not . genetic testing was never a part of a standard military pre - induction physical exam . moreover , the three - letter code has a standard meaning in selective service records , as noted in trump ’ s own selective service classification history : <PARA> all selective service registrants received what was called an “ x - y - z evaluation ,” which was used by the local draft board to determine their classification ( another famous registrant , rock star ted nugent , was also given a “ yxx ” rating , according to thesmokinggun . com ). after receiving several student deferments between 1964 and 1968 , donald trump was ultimately classified 1 - y ( qualified for service only in time of war or national emergency ) for medical reasons ( specifically , bone spurs in both heels , according to a 2015 statement from his presidential campaign ). <PARA> a 2015 statement by trump ’ s physician listed no genetic abnormalities , noting that he was in “ excellent physical health ” overall . given , then , that it was prompted by the misinterpretation of an entry on his selective service record , that it is not supported by actual medical records or a physician ’ s diagnosis , and that trump appears to exhibit few , if any , outward signs of the condition , we find the suggestion that he suffers from klinefelter syndrome unfounded and more than a little absurd .
true	when it comes time to prepare and file your 2006 tax return , make sure you don ’ t overlook the “ federal excise tax refund credit .” you claim the credit on line 71 of your form 1040 . a similar line will be available if you file the short form 1040a . if you have family or friends who no longer file a tax return and they have their own land phone in their home and have been paying a phone bill for years , make sure they know about this form 1040ez - t . <PARA> what is this all about ? well the federal excise tax has been charged to you on your phone bill for years . it is an old tax that was assessed on your toll calls based on how far the call was being made and how much time you talked on that call . when phone companies began to offer flat fee phone service , challenges to the excise tax ended up in federal courts in several districts of the country . the challenges pointed out that flat fee / rate phone service had nothing to do with the distance and the length of the phone call . therefore , the excise tax should / could not be assessed . <PARA> the irs has now conceded this argument . phone companies have been given notice to stop assessing the federal excise tax as of aug 30 , 2006 . you will most likely see the tax on your september cutoff statement , but it should not be on your october bill . <PARA> but the challengers of the old law also demanded restitution . so the irs has announced that a one time credit will be available when you and i file our 2006 tax return as i explained above . however , the irs also established limits on how big a credit you can get . here ‘ s how it works . <PARA> if you file your return as a single person with just you as a dependent , you get to claim a $ 30 credit on line 71 of your 1040 . <PARA> if you file with a child or a parent as your dependent , you claim $ 40 . <PARA> if you file your return as a married couple with no children , you claim $ 40 . <PARA> if you file as married with children , you claim $ 50 if one child , $ 60 if two children . <PARA> in all cases , the most you get to claim is $ 60 – unless you have all your phone bills starting after feb 28 , 2003 through july 31 , 2006 ( do not use any bills starting aug 1 , 2006 .), then you can add up the actual tax as it appears on your bills and claim that for a credit . <PARA> now if you have your actual phone bills and come up with an actual tax amount , you cannot use line 71 on your tax return . you have to complete a special form number 8913 and attach it to your tax return . <PARA> individuals using the special from 1040ez - t will have to attach this form 8913 also . <PARA> one final point – this credit is a refundable credit . that means you get this money , no matter how your tax return works out . if you would end up owing the irs a balance , the refund will reduce that balance you owe . if you end up getting a refund , the credit will be added and you get a bigger refund by that $ 30 to $ 60 , depending on how many dependents are on your return . <PARA> feel free to pass this on or make copies for family and friends who don ’ t have computers . <PARA> origins : in november 2006 , the snopes . com inbox began filling with forwards about a tax credit available in 2006 for overpayment of a federal tax charged on phone calls . for once , an internet forward is on the up - and - up ; there really is such a credit available to taxpayers filing their federal 2006 returns ( which most people will submit to the irs in 2007 ). <PARA> the tax in question , the federal excise tax , was first imposed in 1898 to help fund the spanish - american war . one of the things it taxed was <PARA> telephone service , which at that time was something only the very wealthy had , so this levy served as a luxury tax charged only to those who could easily afford it . <PARA> the war ended and the bills for it were settled up , but the tax stayed in place . over time , as telephone use spread to the masses , what had begun as a charge against the very wealthy for a frippery they could easily have done without became a charge against just about everyone for a service that had come to be regarded as vital . <PARA> the tax was levied against charges accruing to long distance calls , which until recently were primarily determined by a formula based on call length and the distance between conversing parties . that mode of establishing the price of calls has mostly been supplanted by the practice of basing long distance charges on minutes alone , with no regard to the physical distance the calls travel . opponents to the tax asserted that shift made the tax invalid , and the courts finally agreed with them . <PARA> in may 2006 , after losing a series of federal court cases , the internal revenue service said it would no longer collect the 3 percent tax and ordered telephone companies to stop charging it by 1 august 2006 . <PARA> taxpayers are eligible to claim a refund of the long - distance tax billed for any phone service ( cell , fax , computer or land line ) in the 41 - month period from 28 february 2003 through 31 july 2006 . <PARA> on its web site , the irs explains the refund and how to apply for it . additional information can be found by following the links offered on its telephone excise tax page . <PARA> in a nutshell , rather than ask everyone to comb through their phone bills for that 41 - month period to add up all the tax collected <PARA> and then submit claims for those amounts , the irs will offer taxpayers standard refunds of between $ 30 and $ 60 ( the amount depends on the composition of the household ) that they can apply for simply by entering the refund amount appropriate to them on a particular line on their 2006 tax returns . those who wish to go it the long way by adding everything up to emerge with the precise figure owed them may do so , but in their case applying for the refund will require them to complete and file form 8913 with their returns . <PARA> this is a one - time tax credit , so those who fail to file for it on their 2006 returns will likely lose their shot at claiming it . it therefore makes very good sense to let your friends , neighbors , and co - workers know about this opportunity , lest they otherwise miss it . the only mystery in all this lies in the question of why the internet drums only started to beat about this in november 2006 , when the refund was announced in may 2006 , a full six months earlier . <PARA> barbara “ in one half year and out the other , i guess ” mikkelson

mixture	on 3 may 2016 , web site the washington free beacon published an article provocatively titled “ clinton campaign made payments to hard drive and document destruction company ” ( and subtitled “ payments could have purchased destruction of 14 hard drives ”). the article reported that the hillary clinton campaign made payments totaling $ 187 to a document destruction company ( american document destruction , inc .) in february and march of 2016 . <PARA> the article implied ( without directly stating ) that the clinton campaign might have spent the funds on destroying disk drives involved in the controversy surrounding clinton ’ s use of private , home - based servers and accounts for official business she conducted while serving as u . s . secretary of state : <PARA> nowhere did the washington free beacon article offer any evidence that the services provided by american document destruction , inc . to the clinton campaign involved the destruction of hard drives or data from the private server she used while serving as secretary as state . in fact , the article didn ’ t even offer any evidence that the provided services involved the destruction of hard drives at all ( rather than paper documents ). it simply noted that the clinton campaign paid american document destruction , inc . an amount of money that would have covered the costs of destroying 14 hard drives or shredding 37 . 4 cubic feet of paper ( or , presumably , some combination of the two ). <PARA> a follow - up article from another news outlet reported that clinton ’ s campaign also paid $ 50 to shredco , a company that provides safe disposal of paper documents . <PARA> it ’ s extremely unlikely either of these companies were involved in destroying material related to clinton ’ s use of a private e - mail server , for a number of reasons . first of all , the expenditures were openly reported to the federal election commission , an unlikely move for a campaign furtively involved in destroying evidence relating to a federal investigation : <PARA> second , anyone seeking to destroy sensitive information related to a high - level federal investigation probably wouldn ’ t trust the task to businesses who charged only a few hundred dollars for the service , rather than to much more expensive ( and presumably more private and secure ) outfits . <PARA> moreover , even though bernie sanders ’ campaign wasn ’ t embroiled in an e - mail controversy , his campaign paid nearly three times as much as clinton ’ s did for similar services : <PARA> former republican presidential candidate ted cruz also contracted for shredding services in the same timeframe : <PARA> paying for data destruction services is hardly suspect for an organization that processes thousands of donations each month , as the hillary clinton campaign does . personal information from donors ( such as credit card numbers ) would , if printed or stored on hard drives , need to be securely destroyed to protect those donors . and given bernie sanders ’ repeated insistence that the average donation made to his campaign is $ 27 , it seems reasonable that his organization would also be contracting for similar services and paying for a higher volume of shreddable transactions than the clinton campaign .
false	a particularly low - effort hoax spreading online in march 2018 — part of a wave of attempted smear campaigns directed at survivors of a february 2018 mass shooting at a high school in parkland , florida who are calling for stricter gun - control legislation — has led some people to accuse one of the parkland , florida mass shooting survivors of vandalism . <PARA> the hoax was a miscaptioned photograph showing a woman with a bald head as she seemingly prepared to drive an umbrella into a vehicle alongside the caption : “ emma gonzalez attacking a 2nd amendment supporter ’ s truck at a # marchforourlives rally ( colorized ).” <PARA> an alleged “ satire ” site posted the picture alongside a different — but equally false — caption : <PARA> but the woman is the picture is not emma gonzález ; the photograph actually shows singer britney spears during an infamous february 2007 incident that was widely covered at the time . spears later apologized to the photographer who owned the truck , saying that she was “ preparing [ her ] character ” for a movie role . <PARA> “ i take all my roles very seriously and got a little carried away ,” spears wrote in july 2007 . “ unfortunately i didn ’ t get the part .” <PARA> ten years later , daniel ramos , the paparazzo who owned the truck targeted by spears , announced that he would auction the umbrella off and donate half of the proceeds to charity .

false	origins : in 2002 we encountered a rumor that postulated lowe ’ s companies , inc . was begun by the embittered ex - spouse of the owner of the home depot , inc . according to this whisper ( which we ’ ve since heard from a number of folks ), a wife who felt she had not been fairly treated in a divorce used the knowledge she ’ d gained while in her marriage to create a rival to her husband ’ s chain of home improvement supplies business , even to the point of locating her stores next to his in an effort to steal his customers . <PARA> a less well - traveled form of the basic rumor asserts the following : <PARA> [ collected on the internet , 2004 ] <PARA> i heard that the reason home depot and loewe ’ s are always built in close proximity to each other is that the “ owners ” of home depot and loewe ’ s are ex - spouses and that part of the divorce settlement is that wherever home depot builds a store , there must be a comparable space available for loewe ’ s to go in . <PARA> i heard that the reason home depot and loewe ’ s are always built in close proximity to each other is that the “ owners ” of home depot and loewe ’ s are ex - spouses and that part of the divorce settlement is that wherever home depot builds a store , there must be a comparable space available for loewe ’ s to go in . <PARA> in that version , neither spouse is presented as bent upon driving the other ’ s business into the ground ; instead , the puzzling concurrence of so many lowe ’ s and home depots is explained as a condition of the divorce and therefore as an item worked out and agreed to by both parties rather than as something one was doing to taunt or punish the other . <PARA> as inherently satisfying as both forms of the legend are , there isn ’ t a shred of truth to either . lowe ’ s was started in 1946 as a single store in north wilkesboro , north carolina , by two brothers - in - law , james lowe and carl buchan . within a few years buchan bought out lowe but kept the lowe ’ s name , possibly because he liked the sound of “ lowe ’ s low prices .” buchan died in 1961 , the same year the company went public . lowe ’ s began trading on the new york stock exchange in 1979 , and by 2004 its sales totaled $ 36 . 5 billion . as of 2005 , lowe ’ s operates more than 1 , 100 stores in 48 states . its current chairman , president and chief executive officer is robert a . niblock , who has held that position since <PARA> 2003 . <PARA> home depot was founded in 1978 in atlanta , georgia , by bernard marcus and arthur blank , two top executives who had recently been fired from los angeles - based handy dan ( another home improvement chain ), and kenneth langone , a new york investment banker who helped the pair gain the financing they needed to launch their venture . the company went public in 1981 , and by 2005 the parent company , the home depot , inc ., was operating more than 1 , 800 stores ( home depot , expo , and other subsidiary companies ) in 50 states , the district of columbia , the ten canadian provinces , mexico , and puerto rico . while home depot does not yet have stores in china , it did recently open two sourcing offices in that country . the current chairman , president and ceo of home depot is robert l . nardelli , who has been in that position since 2000 . <PARA> we can only guess why the rumor of a vengeful wife has attached to these two home improvement emporiums , speculating that it ’ s possible the tale sprang in part from someone ’ s having noticed the two retailers often locate their stores near one another , a practice that does appear to fly in the face of generally accepted business wisdom regarding not building too close to one ’ s competitor . yet lowe ’ s and home depot seem to want to go head - to - head in battling for the home improvement dollar , with both companies appearing to seek out locations as near as possible to the other ’ s stores . ( for instance , home depot announced in 2003 that it planned to build one of its stores in olive branch , mississippi , a scant half mile from the spot on which lowe ’ s had just six weeks earlier declared it would build .) and in some cases , one retailer will choose to put its store right beside the other ’ s , as in 2003 , when home depot opened one of its outlets right next to an existing lowe ’ s in east brainerd , tn . <PARA> while a variety of rotten tricks have over the course of human history been pulled by retaliation - minded spouses of both sexes , few and far between have been acts of an empowering nature ( which would have been the case here if this legend had been true about a wronged wife who started her own business , then used it to take on the giant in its business sector because she was determined to teach her ex - a lesson ). far more common in situations where there is an acrimonious split between a husband and wife who have knowledge of each other ’ s business dealings is the clandestine phone call to the irs in which misgivings are expressed about the accuracy of the other spouse ’ s corporation ’ s tax returns and a suggestion that an audit of that company ’ s books might not be such a bad idea . as many a vengeance seeker has discovered , who needs the likes of tony soprano to administer a sharp and memorable lesson when uncle sam is but a phone call away ? <PARA> while this next story ( which has been reported as true in canada , yet so far defies our efforts to confirm it ) isn ’ t quite on point , it is similar enough in terms of a retribution - bent wife using “ her ” business to take apart his and humiliate him in the process to bear mentioning here : <PARA> [ taylor , 1996 ] <PARA> consider frank , the hairdresser in vancouver , who was working both sides of the street — literally and figuratively . when creditors began closing in on frank ’ s salon , he opened up a new shop on the other side of the street , going into business against himself . to protect this new salon from his creditors , he registered it in his wife ’ s name . the only problem was that frank ’ s wife knew he was having an affair with her sister , the receptionist at the old salon . and once her name was on the second salon , frank ’ s wife filed for divorce and kept it in the settlement . with the old salon now in bankruptcy , frank had few options . his ex - wife — no doubt relishing her newfound leverage — then offered him work in her salon . in one fell swoop , frank had lost both salons , his marriage had failed and he was working for his ex - wife on salary . <PARA> consider frank , the hairdresser in vancouver , who was working both sides of the street — literally and figuratively . when creditors began closing in on frank ’ s salon , he opened up a new shop on the other side of the street , going into business against himself . to protect this new salon from his creditors , he registered it in his wife ’ s name . the only problem was that frank ’ s wife knew he was having an affair with her sister , the receptionist at the old salon . and once her name was on the second salon , frank ’ s wife filed for divorce and kept it in the settlement . with the old salon now in bankruptcy , frank had few options . his ex - wife — no doubt relishing her newfound leverage — then offered him work in her salon . in one fell swoop , frank had lost both salons , his marriage had failed and he was working for his ex - wife on salary . <PARA> barbara “ and so sank frank ” mikkelson
unproven	on thanksgiving day , after he and elin and the family had turkey dinner , tiger spent the rest of the afternoon on the couch watching football and texting rachel . after he received and sent text message back and forth to rachel , he would clear his message box to destroy the evidence . at some point during the afternoon texting session , one of tiger ’ s orlando buds called him to see if he wanted to get together at the clubhouse to play poker with the guys . tiger agreed and left the house around 7 : 30 to go play poker . he left behind his cell phone .... and one message he had forgot to delete from rachel . <PARA> when tiger returned home around 11 : 30 - 12 that night , elin confronted him about the text message she had found on his phone . a heated discussion ensued . according to what i was told , there was more “ incriminating evidence ” than just the text message ( i . e . photos ). tiger told elin that she was reading too much in to it , and that she did not know the whole story . tiger went upstairs to change into his gym shorts and t - shirt , came back downstairs were elin confronted him , again . tiger gave her the same story as before and sat down in a chair in the living room . <PARA> elin sat across from him . she urged tiger to just come clean . tiger stuck to his story and denied everything . at one point tiger turned away to look at the tv , and as he turned back , elin , enraged , hit him on the right side of the face with the head of a 9 - iron . when she struck tiger , she put a huge gash in the right side of his face next to his nose ( causing his nose to bruise some ), virtually knocked out two of his upper teeth , and broke the bone on the upper right side . <PARA> tiger , scared as hell , ran down the hallway , out of the house to the garage ( explaining why he had on no shoes ) followed by elin swinging the golf club . tiger hopped into the escalade and tried to leave . as we know elin knocked out the windows in the escalade in the process as well as doing considerable damage in the hallway . <PARA> when tiger crashed , elin panicked and was not sure what to tell the police ( which is why there are two conflicting stories from her ). when this happened , elin immediately called mark steinberg to tell him what happened , and mark told elin to tell him what hospital they were going to , and he would meet them there . <PARA> if you remember fhp kept showing up at isleworth to talk to tiger , and was told by another fl attorney , hired by tiger for pr reasons , that tiger was not ready to talk . this is why . <PARA> as amazing as it may seem , tiger was in phoenix . tiger was originally transported to the hospital in orlando with elin in the ambulance where they were met by mr . steinberg . tiger was taken in for x - rays , etc . to assess the damage . the doctors told steinberg there was not much they could do to repair the teeth and the gash , but did know a cosmetic dentist and plastic surgeon in phoenix who could make tiger look as if nothing happened . tiger told steinberg to get the jet ready and he and steinberg flew to phoenix to see the surgeon . the resulting procedures were more intense than what everyone had expected which meant tiger was in phx longer than expected . tiger and steinberg did not arrive back in orlando until either late last wednesday night or early thursday morning . <PARA> since arriving back in orlando , tiger and elin have been in intense marriage conseling sessions ( up to 6 to 7 hours a day ) every day ! both tiger and elin have told the counselors they love each other , and want to make the marriage work . the reports you are reading on tmz and radaronline are about 30 % accurate at best according to mark . <PARA> tiger has not returned to his house at isleworth since the day of the accident except for the therapy sessions . img has enlisted the assistance of one of its most recognized sports figures , and tiger has taken up residence in his neighborhood – bay hill . because of the high regard in which tiger holds him and based on his public persona when he was at the height of his game , the person img contacted was arnold palmer . he has agreed to intervene with tiger . img is convinced that if anyone can get through to tiger , mr . palmer may be the only person who can . <PARA> as to other rumors , my source claims that the moving trucks being shown on tmz and radaronline are moving out pictures and furniture which was damaged during their thanksgiving day argument – not because of elin moving out . yes , elin has retained a divorce attorney , but has not filed any papers . as of yesterday , she had no intention on doing so . <PARA> tiger has not made any public appearances or statements due to the surgery and plastic surgery he had in phx . it will be about another month if not more before he gets in front of a camera . yes , tiger is hitting golf balls late at night at bay hill out of their teaching center ( which is equipped with lights ). in regards to tiger ’ s boat being in palm beach this week , along with rachel ; that part is true . however , tiger is not on the boat , is not in palm beach , and rachel is not on the boat . her parents live 6 blocks from where the boat is , but that is it . <PARA> that is as up to date as i have ........ <PARA> origins : a good deal of mystery still surrounds golfer tiger woods ’ car wreck in the wee hours on the day after thanksgiving 2009 and subsequent revelations of his romantic links to many different women . what triggered that early morning incident ? had his wife found out about his affairs , and if so , how ? why did woods get into his suv and start driving at 2 : 00 am , then run into a fire hydrant and a tree ? was he merely trying to escape an argument with his wife , or was he fleeing from someone who was physically attacking him ? did his wife elin ( as initially claimed in press reports ) really break out a window of his suv with a golf club to help rescue him after his crash , or had she precipitated the wreck by bashing at the car while he was driving it ? is there any chance the woods will salvage their marriage , or is it all over save for the paperwork ? what have tiger and elin been doing and thinking ( together and separately ) since the scandal broke ? <PARA> these questions remain unanswered , in large part because neither participant has yet publicly spoken about what has transpired , and both have remained out of the public eye ever since . tiger woods initially put off speaking to florida law enforcement officials investigating his automobile accident , hasn ’ t issued any statements other than making an initial request for privacy and then posting a few general statements on his web site , and has since announced that he is <PARA> withdrawing from golf . and , seemingly , he has withdrawn from the world at large , becoming ( for the time being ) one of the world ’ s most famous recluses . <PARA> when information is unavailable , rumor and gossip fill the void , and hence the above - quoted account ( initially posted to a forum on the golfwrx . com web site by a participant who purportedly obtained the information from a “ pga pro ”) has been circulating widely on the internet since mid - december . this narrative is particularly intriguing because it neatly fills in the framework of what little the public knows with details that are both logically consistent and not altogether implausible . of course , what everyone wants to know is whether this account ( or any portion of it ) is actually true , or whether it ’ s simply more unconfirmed rumor and gossip . <PARA> at this point , with hard information lacking , we can only engage in conjecture , and the first aspect of speculation is the account ’ s purported origins : in true urban legend - like fashion , it ’ s an anonymous account based on information supposedly obtained from someone who plays golf with an “ insider ” who knows tiger woods ’ agent , mark steinberg ( who presumably heard it from his client ). a long chain of transmission doesn ’ t necessarily invalidate the account , but we note that ( as exemplified by the children ’ s game of “ telephone ”) as information becomes further removed from its original source and passes through more hands it generally becomes less reliable . we also note that some of the events described took place in private , and thus only the participants themselves ( i . e ., tiger and elin woods ) could attest to what actually happened . this means that some of the information presented above could have reached the public only if one of the woods disclosed it to a confidant , who then blabbed it to others . ( a tendency to blab is not a quality one typically looks for in a confidant , especially one who serves in a professional capacity such as an agent , and steinberg said the e - mail was “ just another patently false rumor being circulated .”) additionally , even information obtained directly from the participants themselves may not be accurate , as parties engaged in adversarial situations will often shade their versions of events to favor themselves and cast the other party in a bad light . <PARA> gerald posner , writing for the daily beast , reported that “ two sources who know elin nordegren ” had confirmed ( on conditions of anonymity ) an account of the night tiger crashed his suv that included the following points : <PARA> our best guess is that this account is a mixture of truth , falsity , exaggeration , and speculation , and accurately sorting out which parts are which will be possible only when the parties involved begin talking . but even in the absence of confessions , some have found a few of the details to be questionable , such as the claim that elin smacked her husband in the face with a 9 - iron , loosening some of his teeth and breaking a bone in his face , an injury so serious that it presumably caused him to wreck his car as he tried to flee and led him to fly off to phoenix for plastic surgery ( with his subsequent withdrawal from public life being explained by his need to hide the tell - tale signs of surgery ). <PARA> according to orlando , florida , tv station wesh , tiger woods was still in florida when troopers from the state ’ s highway patrol unit ( fhp ) met with him several days after the accident , and the only injury they reporting seeing on his head or face was a superficial one : <PARA> the florida highway patrol met with tiger woods in orlando several days after his crash in isleworth and said he only had “ a fat lip ,” fhp told wesh . <PARA> fhp spokeswoman kim montes said woods met with troopers at an undisclosed location on dec . 1 to deliver his ticket and see if woods had any injuries that might not be consistent with his traffic accident . <PARA> montes said troopers only noted “ a fat lip ” and no other facial injuries — and no reason to believe he was the victim of domestic violence . <PARA> on the day tiger woods was issued and signed a traffic ticket for careless driving , the florida highway patrol confirms two captains and a trooper met in person with woods and his attorney mark nejame . <PARA> montes said that meeting happened “ in orlando at an undisclosed location .” <PARA> the meeting came three days after woods crashed into a curb , fire hydrant and tree outside his isleworth home in orange county . the crash set off a flurry of media coverage , with several women coming forward claiming to be woods ’ mistresses . <PARA> fhp spokeswoman kim montes said woods met with troopers at an undisclosed location on dec . 1 to deliver his ticket and see if woods had any injuries that might not be consistent with his traffic accident . <PARA> montes said troopers only noted “ a fat lip ” and no other facial injuries — and no reason to believe he was the victim of domestic violence . <PARA> on the day tiger woods was issued and signed a traffic ticket for careless driving , the florida highway patrol confirms two captains and a trooper met in person with woods and his attorney mark nejame . <PARA> montes said that meeting happened “ in orlando at an undisclosed location .” <PARA> the meeting came three days after woods crashed into a curb , fire hydrant and tree outside his isleworth home in orange county . the crash set off a flurry of media coverage , with several women coming forward claiming to be woods ’ mistresses . <PARA> even if his injuries were more extensive , would tiger woods have needed to fly all the way across the united states to find a dentist and plastic surgeon capable of repairing a few loose teeth and a “ gash ” on his face ? and medical confidentiality notwithstanding , could woods really have secretly flown cross - county and undergone prolonged medical treatment at a time when law enforcement and the nation ’ s press were clamoring to find and speak with him , all without anyone ’ s gleaning or leaking a word of his whereabouts ? <PARA> all in all , tiger woods already has plenty of reasons to want to avoid facing the public right now , even without a rumored need to recover from plastic surgery . <PARA> update : in january 2010 , news accounts reported that tiger woods had been seen at <PARA> the pine grove behavioral health and addiction services facility in hattiesburg , mississippi . ( he has also been reported as undergoing treatment at <PARA> the meadows addiction treatment center in wickenburg , arizona .) <PARA> update : in his public statement of 19 february 2010 , tiger woods said that “ for 45 days from the end of december [ 2009 ] to early february [ 2010 ] he was “ in inpatient therapy receiving guidance ,” but he did not specify where the treatment was taking place . he also emphatically denied rumors that his wife had physically attacked him : <PARA> i have a lot to atone for , but there is one issue i really want to discuss . some people have speculated that elin somehow hurt or attacked me on thanksgiving night . it angers me that people would fabricate a story like that . elin never hit me that night or any other night . there has never been an episode of domestic violence in our marriage , ever .
false	a news item posted by the swedish news service svt on 23 october 2016 reported that trafikverket , the swedish transport administration , will no longer allow local municipalities to hang christmas lights on the street poles under its control , citing two reasons : first , the law doesn ’ t authorize the agency to share its electricity , and second , the poles aren ’ t designed to bear extra weight , so christmas decorations are a safety hazard . <PARA> this wasn ’ t happy news for small towns like hestra , in western sweden , where residents have adorned the main street with poinsettias every christmas for the past 20 years , svp reported . they asked for and received a two - year exemption on the ruling , which means they ’ ll be able to decorate as usual this christmas and next , but what happens after that is a question mark . several municipalities have vowed to fight the decision . <PARA> though there wasn ’ t a single mention of religion , immigrants , or refugees in the original report , various unreliable web sites quickly recast it as a “ war on christmas ” story . for example , the conspiracy theory site infowars presented the christmas light policy as a “ capitulation to islam ”: <PARA> breitbart contributor milo yiannopoulos posted an article questioning the swedish transport administration ’ s justification of the policy : <PARA> the morning news usa web site took the cake for hyperbole , headlining its article , “ sweden no longer celebrating christmas : bans holiday for fear of offending muslim migrants .” yet nothing could be further from the truth . sweden hasn ’ t banned christmas , nor has it banned any form of christmas decorations apart from those attached to street poles . its justification wasn ’ t “ fear of offending muslim migrants ,” but rather unauthorized use of electricity and public safety concerns . <PARA> as part of their apparent effort to generate anti - immigrant hysteria , some of these sites also repeated false reports of “ no - go zones ” overrun with lawless migrants in swedish cities . in september 2016 , according to the news site the local , an official of the swedish embassy in hungary ( where rumors of immigrant - caused chaos in sweden and other parts of europe were proliferating ) said no such zones , “ however they are labelled or defined ,” exist in sweden .
false	in september 2014 , amid controversy over the national football league ’ s ( nfl ) handling of domestic abuse cases involving some of its players , senator cory booker of new jersey introduced a bill that sought to accomplish what other members of congress had previously attempted to do : disallow professional sports leagues , including the nfl , from claiming status as tax - exempt nonprofit organizations . this news prompted many of our readers to inquire , “ huh , is the nfl really tax - exempt ? how is that ?”: <PARA> it was true that the nfl , a sports league that generates an estimated $ 9 . 5 billion in revenue each year , enjoyed the status of being a tax - exempt nonprofit organization , a status that had also applied to the national hockey league , the pga tour , and major league baseball ( until 2007 ). but the key to understanding that exemption is realizing that it did not apply to the dozens of individual teams who are football ’ s primary money - makers , but only to a small part of the nfl , the nfl league office : <PARA> the nfl was first bestowed with its tax - exempt status in 1942 , when the league was struggling financially amidst the entry of the u . s . into world war ii and ( successfully ) filed an application for tax - exempt , non - profit status with the irs . exactly what the nfl claimed its “ nonprofit mission ” was back then remains something of a mystery , as the nfl maintained it lost the copy of the application it filed with the irs in 1942 , and the irs likewise said it was unable to find a copy of the nfl ’ s original application . <PARA> some critics have maintained that the nfl ( and the nfl alone , not other sports leagues ) was tax - exempt due to a special “ loophole ” inserted into the tax code in 1966 , referencing section 501 ( c )( 6 ) of the irs code , a section that specifically includes “ professional football leagues ” along with “ business leagues , chambers of commerce , real - estate boards , or boards of trade ” as tax - exempt organizations . however , the nfl had been afforded tax - exempt status well before that modification was enacted — the code change was undertaken solely to allow the merger of the nfl and afl ( american football league ) to go forward without fear of an antitrust challenge under either the clayton antitrust act or the federal trade commissions act : <PARA> still , some critics maintained that the nfl should never have been granted tax - exempt status in the first place , much less have been allowed to maintain it for so long , as the league was neither an “ open ” industry nor one that worked towards the greater good of its industry or the public at large : <PARA> in april 2015 , the nfl announced the league office would be giving up its status as a tax - exempt organization during the 2015 fiscal year :
false	on 2 september 2016 , a screenshot of a tweet purportedly sent out by a cbs reporter claiming that hillary clinton would drop out of the presidential race appeared on social media : <PARA> the image displayed above was picked up by unscrupulous web sites , and was shared with the claim that chanpong deleted the tweet almost immediately after it was posted ( presumably to explain why it could not be found on her timeline ): <PARA> however , this wasn ’ t a tweet posted and then mysteriously deleted by chanpong ; it is actually a fake that was never posted to her account to begin with . <PARA> creating a fake tweet is a relatively easy process . even so , most fraudsters ( whether through ignorance or carelessness ) simply cannot get all the details right . the biggest giveaway that the tweet here is a hoax is that it contains “ retweets ” and “ favorites .” however , twitter got rid of “ favorites ” in november 2015 — nearly a year before this hoax tweet went out — and replaced them with “ likes .” <PARA> a tweet sent out on 2 september 2016 would have the number of “ retweets ” and “ likes ” displayed , not the number of “ favorites ”:
mixture	on 8 june 2016 , the facebook page “ the bern report ” shared a document authored by researchers axel geijsel of tilburg university in the netherlands and rodolfo cortes barragan of stanford university suggesting that “ the outcomes of the 2016 democratic party nomination contest [ are not ] completely legitimate : <PARA> in an appendix , geijsel and barragan stated that their research was still in progress and had not yet been subject to peer review , but since the information was highly topical they believed it better to pre - release their findings due to the ongoing primary ballot count in california ( among other factors ): <PARA> the post - introduction portion of the paper began with a comparison of outcomes in “ primary states with paper trails and without paper trails ,” holding that potentially inaccurate results led the researchers to “ restrict [ our ] analysis to a proxy : the percentage of delegates won by secretary clinton and senator sanders .” after identifying via the ballotpedia web site 18 states that use a form of paper verification for votes compared to 13 states without such a “ paper trail ,” they concluded that states without “ paper trails ” demonstrated a higher rate of support for hillary clinton : <PARA> the information included in the appendix didn ’ t explicate exactly what those alternative explanations might be : <PARA> in the paper ’ s second portion , the researchers examined discrepancies between exit polls and final results by state , a subject of debate ( hashtagged # exitpollgate on social media ) that antedated the publication of their paper and was addressed in a nation article disputing the claim that exit polls revealed fraud . the nation ‘ s analysis held that fraud detection exit polling varied significantly from the type of exit polling typically carried out in the united states : <PARA> as well , standard exit polling conducted in the u . s . can be very inaccurate and systematically biased for a number of reasons , including : <PARA> as the new york times put it , “[ n ] o one who studies the exit polls believes that they can be used as an indicator of fraud in the way the conspiracy theorists do .” <PARA> nonetheless , geijsel and barragan contended in their paper that : <PARA> the expert whose numbers were utilized for the paper wasn ’ t expressly cited by name , but his moniker appeared on the linked spreadsheet : richard charnin . charnin indeed lists some impressive statistical credentials on his personal blog , but he also appears to expend much of his focus on conspiracy theories related to the jfk assassination ( which raises the question of whether his math skills outstrip his ability to apply skeptical reasoning to data ). <PARA> geijsel addressed questions about exit poll numbers in a subsequent e - mail to a blogger who was highly skeptical of his research : <PARA> that blogger passed the anlysis on to his father (“ a retired professor emeritus in mathematics and applied statistics at the university of northern colorado ”), donald t . searls , ph . d ., for comment : <PARA> although geijsel cited a number of sources to substantiate the claim that fraud was well - documented in the 2016 primary season , most of those citations involved persons with an interest in the overall dispute ( such as groups party to lawsuits ). that factor doesn ’ t necessarily cast doubt on the researchers ’ findings , but it highlights that not much independent and neutral verification of their conclusions has occurred yet .
false	this item is a difficult one to classify : it ’ s literally false as worded , because the person named didn ’ t speak the specific words attributed to him at the time and place claimed ( or at any other time and place ). however , by combining things the same person said at different times and places , one could come up with a reasonable approximation of the original statement . <PARA> the subject here is a quote attributed to a 1955 west point address by general of the army douglas macarthur , in which the famous military man supposedly mused about the next war being an interplanetary one . that alleged quote has since been cited in a variety of works and web sites related to ufos and extraterrestrials and still surfaces in newspapers and other publications from time to time : <PARA> however , general macarthur did not deliver a speech at west point that year , nor is there any record of his specifically stating an opinion that the “ next war ” would be an “ interplanetary ” one . <PARA> the confusion started with comments reportedly made by macarthur when he was paid a private visit at his residence in new york ’ s waldorf - astoria hotel by the mayor of naples , achille lauro , in october 1955 . the following day mayor lauro relayed the gist of their 45 - minute conversation to the press , maintaining macarthur had expressed a belief that someday ( perhaps as far as 1 , 000 years in the future ) the people of earth might find themselves facing an extraterrestrial confrontation : <PARA> according to lauro , the only comments macarthur made about the next war were that he had no idea what form it would take : <PARA> some newspapers ( such as the chicago tribune ) played up the sensational aspects of mayor lauro ’ s remarks , reproducing only a brief portion of them under headlines such as “ macarthur fears space war .” <PARA> several years later , on 12 may 1962 , macarthur delivered a speech ( commonly known as the “ duty , honor , country ” speech ) to the cadets of the u . s . military academy at west point on the occasion of his receiving the sylvanus thayer award , during which he once again alluded to the possibility that mankind might someday face an extraterrestrial foe : <PARA> so , general douglas macarthur did suggest the notion of an eventual interplanetary war on at least a couple of occasions ; one of them was in 1955 , and one of them was during a speech at west point . but he never stated it would be the “ next war ” fought on ( or by ) earth , or that it was likely to happen in any timeframe outside of the very distant future .
false	in january 2017 , not long before the official inauguration of president - elect donald trump , an image purportedly showing a message on the sign for the hampton united methodist church made the rounds on social media : <PARA> this is not a real photograph showing a joke about donald trump written on a church sign . in fact , it doesn ’ t even show a real church sign . the original image shows a sign outside roosevelt middle school in oakland , california and can be glimpsed at the 42 - second mark of the following video about the school ’ s 2012 graduation :
false	on 23 november 2016 , nevada county scooper ( also known as nc scooper ) published an article that appeared to report that president - elect donald trump ’ s daughter ivanka would be moving into the white house in lieu of her father ’ s wife melania : <PARA> it is true that melania trump is not immediately expected to move to the white house from new york city . however , the portion about ivanka trump taking melania ’ s place at any point was fabricated . <PARA> although nc scooper ‘ s humor is typically fairly obvious , the claim about ivanka trump was not the first that readers mistook for real news . previous articles shared as legitimate news included claims that five million uncounted bernie sanders ballots were found on hillary clinton ’ s e - mail server ( and that sanders had called for “ chemtrail reform “), that meg white was selected as the new drummer for the band rush , that merle haggard left his entire estate to a lgbt group , that roving gun confiscation vans had been spotted in california , and that the clintons surreptitiously purchased a mansion in the maldives .
unproven	on 14 june 2016 facebook user michael steven young shared a video to multiple local news outlets ’ pages , claiming it that depicted his discovery of little debbie brand oatmeal creme pies contaminated with live worms : <PARA> videos of such nature typically spread quickly online , and by 21 june 2016 one social media post of it had racked up tens of thousands of shares . however , commenters remarking on the video were overwhelmingly skeptical , with many positing that the packaging appeared to have been opened and resealed ( perhaps with a lighter ): <PARA> in a separate post made by a different user to little debbie ’ s facebook page , a commenter asserted that young had “ refused to provide a sample , not the whole thing , but a sample ” of the purportedly contaminated product to the company for inspection . ( we were unable to locate the source of that claim .) <PARA> one of the news outlets approached by young covered his claims but undertook no additional verification and took them at face value : <PARA> missing from that report was any information about the “ response ” with which young was unsatisfied or details of communication between him and the brand . we contacted little debbie for those absent details and obtained answers to many questionable aspects of the story . <PARA> the representative with whom we spoke stated that the company had dispatched a representative to young ’ s home shortly after his little debbie video began circulating on facebook . according to little debbie , young was initially reluctant to allow the representative to inspect the package and refused to provide a sample of the product for testing . the rep who briefly inspected the packaging observed what appeared to be a small hole in the corner of the package , and the company believed the depicted insect was a pantry moth . as many facebook commenters also opined , the representative noted that the “ crackle ” of the packaging sounded atypical . <PARA> the individual to whom we spoke explained that the cakes are baked at 350 degrees , rendering them “ essentially sterile ,” and they ’ re immediately factory - sealed after baking with a puff of air to ensure the integrity of the seal is detectable to consumers . the representative was able to determine that the package in question was manufactured on or around 27 may 2016 , and that young claimed to have purchased it two weeks prior . he opined that given the lifecycle of pantry moths ( 30 to 300 days ), the claim as presented was scientifically implausible . however , the processing procedures cited and timeline suggested that if a pantry moth were introduced to the package , it was unlikely a factory - end issue . it remained possible that the package was contaminated in a grocery store or home environment , but unlikely contamination occurred before it was sealed and shipped to a retail outlet .
false	on 11 september 2016 , video of democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton swaying and appearing to faint at an event added fuel to already rampant rumors that she was battling everything from a brain tumor to vascular dementia . the rumors were not tamped down by the clinton campaign ’ s disclosure that she was , in fact , suffering from pneumonia , nor were they affected by her appearance at her daughter ’ s apartment later that day . <PARA> in fact , her trip to her daughter ’ s new york city apartment gave rise to a new rumor : that chelsea clinton ’ s purported apartment is actually a front for a medical facility , placed in new york specially so that her mother could receive clandestine medical care whenever she needed it . this particular theory was bolstered by the fact that the apartment building , the whitman , really did have an office for a medical care facility at some point : <PARA> but , as the new york department of health listing clearly says , the facility closed well before its relaunch as a luxe apartment complex in 2013 : <PARA> the whitman was built in 1924 , originally intended as the headquarters for a textile company called “ clarence b . whitman & sons .” it went through many iterations before it became the “ luxury fortress ” that chelsea clinton bought just after its conversion into apartments . a profile of the building mentions that the developer who converted them bought them in 2011 : <PARA> the plumbers local 1 had owned the building since the 1970s , and much of it was empty by the time mitchell ’ s company bought it out : <PARA> part of the building was evidently used by metrocare home services ( and other businesses , as is common in new york city ) for some time , as can be seen by the following document dated august 1991 : <PARA> as of 2012 , metrocare is a division of tri - borough home care , which offers support services for the elderly and those with alzheimer ’ s , diabetes , hiv and aids , and other health issues that limit mobility inside and outside the home ; while it does offer on - site care , the company is headquartered elsewhere . after the merger , the company pruned its staff and closed some of its offices , presumably including the office in the building now occupied by chelsea clinton , although we were unable to locate any official records of when that particular office actually closed . <PARA> however , tri - borough home care and metrocare don ’ t have a main facility that services patients ; the services they offer are strictly at the patients ’ homes ( which is why they have home care right in the name ). from tri - borough home care ’ s web site : <PARA> when the whitman ’ s fourth floor apartment was offered for sale in early 2013 , over five months before chelsea clinton and her husband purchased it , its listing included no photographs or mention of a medical facility among its amenities . <PARA> even if hillary clinton were receiving clandestine medical care at a secret facility , there would be no reason for that facility to be located at metrocare home services ’ former site , as all of the medical care offered by them was , by nature , outside their office .

true	origins : in 1969 , australian john rendall and his friend ace bourke ( whose surname is often rendered as “ berg ”), both of whom were then living in london , bought a lion cub named christian from harrods department store , as the former recounted for the daily mail in 2007 : <PARA> “ a friend had been to the ‘ exotic animals ’ department at harrods and announced , rather grandly , that she wanted a camel ,” says rendall . <PARA> “ to which the manager very coolly replied : ‘ one hump or two , madam ?’ <PARA> “ ace and i thought this was the most sophisticated repartee we ’ d ever heard , so we went along to check it out — and there , in a small cage , was a gorgeous little lion cub . we were shocked . we looked at each other and said something ’ s got to be done about that .” <PARA> harrods , it turned out , was also quite keen to be rid of christian , who had escaped one night , sneaked into the neighbouring carpet department — then in the throes of a sale of goatskin rugs — and wreaked havoc . <PARA> the store , which had acquired the cub from ilfracombe zoo , happily agreed to part with him for 250 guineas . so began christian ’ s year as an urban lion . <PARA> “ to which the manager very coolly replied : ‘ one hump or two , madam ?’ <PARA> “ ace and i thought this was the most sophisticated repartee we ’ d ever heard , so we went along to check it out — and there , in a small cage , was a gorgeous little lion cub . we were shocked . we looked at each other and said something ’ s got to be done about that .” <PARA> harrods , it turned out , was also quite keen to be rid of christian , who had escaped one night , sneaked into the neighbouring carpet department — then in the throes of a sale of goatskin rugs — and wreaked havoc . <PARA> the store , which had acquired the cub from ilfracombe zoo , happily agreed to part with him for 250 guineas . so began christian ’ s year as an urban lion . <PARA> for the next year the two men ( along with rendall ’ s girl friend and an actress ) raised the cub in the sophistocat furniture shop , where christian had living quarters in the basement , and the lion became a popular local figure . however , when christian grew from his initial 35 lb . to 185 lb . within a <PARA> year , his keepers realized their lion would need to be relocated to a more suitable environment . <PARA> by chance , one day bill travers and virginia mckenna — the stars of the 1966 film born free — wandered into sophistocat looking for a desk . the actors suggested that conservationist george adamson ( whose wife , joy , wrote the book born free about their real - life experiences in raising a lion cub and rehabilitating it into the wild ) <PARA> might be able to help find an appropriate home for christian . <PARA> rendall and berg flew with christian to nairobi , kenya , where they met up with george adamson , who helped the lion settle into living an independent life ( and integrating into a pride with other lions ) in kenya ’ s kora reserve . the video clip linked above shows scenes from the two men ’ s reunion with christian in 1971 .
mixture	a recurring scientific item spread online since 2013 has presented variations of the claim that bee sting venom can kill hiv , the disease that often leads to aids . this assertion is rooted in a 2013 study published in the journal antiviral therapy . <PARA> as stated in that paper , the goal of the research was to establish a proof - of - concept for a topical anti - hiv gel using melittin , a peptide found in bee venom , that could serve as a prophylactic against hiv when applied prior to sexual activity . <PARA> that melittin is damaging to viruses is not the breakthrough aspect of this research . melittin is a cytolytic , which essentially means it can destroy cells by increasing their permeability . the problem is that melittin has this effect not just on viruses , but also on important human cells : <PARA> the breakthrough in this study was the researchers ’ ability to attach melittin to complex nanoparticles that allowed the compound to selectively target hiv without coming into contact with non - viral cells : <PARA> their results were promising , too . melittin that was not attached to these bumper - modified nanoparticles inhibited the hiv virus ’ s ability to infect cells , but it was also toxic to normal vaginal cells . but , according to the study , that latter effect was successfully blunted : <PARA> this meant that by proof of concept standards , the research team had succeeded . later research achieved another goal : demonstrating that the gel was not toxic to sperm , either . that mileston would be a step forward for mixed hiv status couples interested in a natural conception , the authors of that study argued . <PARA> but ultimately , the truth is that while this compound is a component of bee venom , the delivery of that compound is a specifically engineered nanoscale process . it should also be noted that these studies didn ’ t even use melittin from an actual bee , but instead used a synthetic version — so being stung by live bees will in no way afford one protection against hiv .
false	in february 2020 , news reports broke that russia was once again working to meddle in the united states presidential election . these reports renewed concerns about u . s . president donald trump ’ s connections to russia , but also about alleged ties of his democratic opponents , chiefly u . s . sen . bernie sanders . <PARA> critics of sanders were quick to claim that he had “ honeymooned ” in the soviet union , implying that the 2020 democratic presidential candidate may have some sort of nefarious ties to , or at the very least a soft spot for , russia . <PARA> former wisconsin gov . scott walker , for instance , posted on twitter : <PARA> likewise , former new york mayor rudy giuliani claimed that sanders “ liked communism so much ” that he “ honeymooned ” in the soviet union : <PARA> fox news anchor sean hannity went so far as to claim that sanders honeymooned in the soviet union during the “ height of the cold war .” <PARA> a bit of truth exists to this claim . sanders did travel to the soviet union shortly after his wedding in 1988 , and sanders himself has described this trip as a “ very strange honeymoon .” however , a romantic getaway was not the main focus of this trip . sanders , who was the mayor of burlington , vermont , at the time , took a 12 - person delegation of city representatives and officials , including his new wife jane sanders , the director of the mayor ’ s youth office , on a trip to the soviet union to establish a sister city relationship with yaroslavl . <PARA> furthermore , this trip occurred in june 1988 . this was not the “ height of the cold war ,” as hannity claimed . this trip occurred during the final years of the cold war ( which ended roughly in 1991 ) while tensions were de - escalating . <PARA> sanders explained the purpose of this trip in a november 1987 news article published in the burlington free press : <PARA> on may 31 , 1988 , a few days after sanders ’ wedding and the day the burlington delegation was set to leave for the soviet union , the associated press reported that this trip wasn ’ t exactly a honeymoon : <PARA> critics of sanders were not the first to claim that the democratic presidential candidate had “ honeymooned ” in russia . in fact , sanders himself described this trip as a “ romantic honeymoon ” in his 2015 book “ outsider in the white house .” however , this appears to be a bit of a tongue - in - cheek reference as he describes the trip a few sentences later as a “ very strange honeymoon .” <PARA> a spokesperson for sanders ’ campaign told us that the senator has “ joked for years ,” including in the above - quoted passage , that this trip was a “ strange honeymoon .” furthermore , the spokesperson told us that this trip was pre - scheduled before sanders ’ marriage proposal , and that the wedding date was set to “ coincide with that trip because they didn ’ t want to take more time off .” <PARA> bernie and jane sanders took their real honeymoon the following year in st . lucia in the caribbean . the new york times reported in december 2015 ( emphasis ours ): <PARA> it should also be noted that the suggestion for yarsovl to become burlington ’ s sister city did not originate with sanders . an april 1988 article from the burlington free press reported that robert daniels , a university of vermont history professor , suggested yaroslavl to be burlington ’ s sister city , noting that the two cities share similar “ forest and dairy ” environments , and that yaroslavl ’ s university was comparable to the university of vermont . <PARA> in summation : <PARA> a spokesperson for sanders told us : “ st lucia was the real honeymoon , yaroslav was a pre - scheduled trip the day after they were married . it was a fun joke to call it a honeymoon , but not a real one .”

unproven	a video purportedly showing a woman stabbing her dancing partner ( presumably her spouse or boyfriend ) has been making its way around the internet since at least february 2018 . <PARA> the following footage could be considered nsfw : <PARA> we ’ ve encountered numerous versions of this video on both english - and russian - language websites . the accompanying captions and comments have not provided much detail about where or when the video was filmed , and they have been contradictory in the details they have provided . for instance , one facebook post claimed that these two individuals were strangers to each other , while a youtube post asserted that they were husband and wife . another tweet didn ’ t venture a guess as to the relationship between these two individuals but stated that the stabbing occurred after the man accidentally stepped on the woman ’ s foot . <PARA> in other words , this shocking video has been circulating for several months without anyone ’ s offering any genuine context for it . <PARA> the example included at the top of this article dates to 27 february 2018 and is the earliest posting of this clip that we could uncover . however , a higher - quality version of this video ( which included an additional 20 seconds of footage ) was posted to youtube on 6 march 2018 . that version , too , failed to provide any credible context about what the footage depicted , although it did offer us a better look at the alleged stabbing . <PARA> the first thing we noticed is that this couple is dancing on a stage similar to ones found in a small theater house . the band , the various pieces of furniture , and the “ cutting award ” prop in which the knife rested suggested some sort of stage ( d ) production : <PARA> we took a closer look at the actual stabbing and this , too , seemed more aligned with a theatrical production than an actual attempt at murder . <PARA> for example , one of the knife ’ s slash markings appeared to be visible on the man ’ s shirt prior to the commencement of the actual stabbing : <PARA> we reached out to steve tolin , the founder of tolin fx , a special fx makeup studio that has worked on some of the bloodier aspects on movies such as jack reacher , adventureland , and the show mindhunters , to ask his opinion on this stabbing footage . he told us that in his opinion this stabbing appeared fake and was likely created with a prop called a “ bleeding knife .” <PARA> a bleeding knife prop makes it appear as if a mortal wound is being inflicted while fake blood is actually squirted out from a rig behind the knife ’ s blade as it is dragged across a surface . here ’ s a very child friendly version of the bleeding knife prop from dreamworks tv : <PARA> the use of such a prop would also explain why the incident depicted in the viral video isn ’ t nearly as bloody as one might expect ( the human body , after all , contains about 5 liters of blood , while a prop knife only holds a few ounces ). the man is shown being slashed three times across the back and once across the throat , yet not a drop of his blood is visible on the dance floor . the bleeding from the victims ’ s back wounds also seem to stop abruptly once the knife is no longer in contact with his shirt . <PARA> additionally , this video purportedly shows a knife tearing open a man ’ s flesh through his shirt , yet the shirt appears mostly undamaged ( other than a few stains ) at the end of the attack : <PARA> although we have not been able to pinpoint the specific origins of this video , we are highly skeptical that it shows a real , spontaneous stabbing taking place on a dance floor .
false	origins : black marlin have a reputation in sport fishing circles as being among the most difficult fish to catch , because they are both very large ( weighing up to 2 , 000 pounds ) and very fast ( reaching speeds of up to 80 mph ). in january 2013 , a series of <PARA> photographs were posted to the facebook page of marlin magazine ( under the title “ marlin wins !”) which purportedly demonstrated just how difficult pulling in a black marlin can be , supposedly showing a charter sport - fishing boat that sank off the coast of panama after a passenger hooked a huge marlin that ended up capsizing the boat . <PARA> although the photographs are genuine , according to an entry posted to the hull truth boating and fishing forum by someone representing himself as an agent of the boat ’ s manufacturer , the photographs don ’ t depict what many viewers have interpreted them to show , chiefly that a gigantic marlin caught on a fishing line was so large and strong that it managed to pull the boat onto its side and sink it . according to that poster , the marlin ’ s role in the incident was indirect , and the boat ’ s sinking was a freak accident caused by sea conditions — while the captain was “ backing down ” on the fish ( i . e ., putting the boat in reverse to help reel in line ), a large wave came over the stern and knocked him off - balance , causing him to inadvertently knock the throttle into full reverse and thereby swamp the boat : <PARA> i wanted to assist in clearing up the mystery of the black marlin and the 37 strike . <PARA> as you have read there are many posts and sites that contain justified and unjustified statements . please know that this is one of those freak accidents and accidents happen anywhere at any time . we are thankful that there were fellow fisherman there and no one was hurt . <PARA> however , as the boat ’ s manufacturer i feel compelled to address some posts . as some think , the marlin did not take down the boat . the transom is 3 feet high from the waterline with a 13 ft . beam , and a stepped hull does not play into what happened . the engine room was not filled with water , considering [ that ] the engines were still running . there was not a cracked exhaust or loose hose , [ and ] the boat is equipped with bilge pumps , alarms and a lower helm station . this boat has been chartering in these same waters and conditions for over two years and has backed down on hundreds of marlin without issue or concern . <PARA> direct from panama i was told that the sea conditions were not as calm as they seem to be in the pictures , and the captain was an experienced captain . the seas were full of big swells and large waves . a large wave came over the transom , and with the anglers all being in the starboard corner , the boat leaned and the captain in the tower lost his footing . while the boat was still in reverse , another wave came over the transom . at this time the captain slipped and [ was ] believed to still have his hand on the throttle , putting the boat in full reverse [ and ] burying the transom into the next waves and swells . you can see how this might happen ; as you know , when fighting a fish the captain is facing aft with his hand on the throttles and when slipped the last thing your hand is holding onto is the throttle controls . <PARA> as mentioned this is freak accident where no one is to blame ( not even the marlin ). guys , be careful out there ; anything can happen . good fishing !

false	in late summer of 2019 , several right - leaning u . s . websites reported , with a degree of outrage , that the european union ( eu ) would soon be enforcing a rule whereby “ jewish - made ” products would have to be labeled as such , following advice given by an eu judicial official . <PARA> on aug . 9 , the washington free beacon published an article with the headline “ europe poised to put warning labels on jewish - made products ,” adding that the purported decision was “ reminiscent of holocaust - era boycotts of jews .” the red state blog wrote in its headline , “ eu preparing to put warning labels on jewish products ,” and reported that : <PARA> “ the european union is preparing to add warning labels on jewish products made in israel . not content with generations of antisemitism before and after the holocaust , europe ’ s ruling class apparently thinks it ’ s a good idea to push what is the equivalent of an in kind contribution to the boycott , divestment , and sanction movement .” <PARA> the blogger robert spencer , who runs the jihad watch website , went further in his characterization of the episode , publishing a blog post with the headline , “ nazism returns : european union to put warning labels on jewish - made products .” he joined the washington free beacon in linking the episode to the holocaust , writing “ europe has gone down this road before . it didn ’ t end well .” <PARA> the american center for law and justice ( aclj ), a christian conservative organization whose chief counsel is president donald trump ’ s attorney jay sekulow , released a podcast episode whose title similarly claimed : “ europe to force warning labels on jewish - made products .” in an accompanying blog post , the aclj wrote : <PARA> “ in an extremely troubling move , europe is poised to force warning labels on jewish made products sold within europe . today on the broadcast , we discussed a decision out of the european court of justice ( ecj ) that , if upheld , would mandate that jewish and israeli products coming out of ‘ settlements ’ and ‘ israeli colonies ’ have warning labels placed on them for coming from so - called disputed areas .” <PARA> a common thread throughout these reports was the claim that the eu was set to introduce a policy requiring products made by jewish people in israel to be labeled as such , if imported into the eu . that claim was false . neither religious affiliation nor ethnic background had any relevance to advice given to the european court of justice ( ecj ) in the summer of 2019 , nor the matter being considered by the court . <PARA> as of mid - august , the ecj had not issued a decision on the matter ( contrary to the aclj ’ s allusion to “ a decision out of the ecj ”). rather , one of the court ’ s advocates general ( formal advisors ) discharged his duty by providing the ecj a piece of non - binding guidance on the matter . in short , he advised that eu law required products made in israeli - occupied territories and settlements to be labeled as such , in the interest of informing eu consumers . <PARA> we are neither agreeing nor disagreeing with the advocate general ’ s conclusion , but in order to understand how he reached it , we must look at some important and occasionally somewhat complicated background information about eu policy towards both the israeli - occupied territories and food labeling . <PARA> eu stance towards israeli - occupied territories <PARA> the eu , as a set of institutions , does not recognize the territories of the golan heights , the west bank ( including east jerusalem ), and the gaza strip as being a part of the state of israel . this is based on several united nations security council resolutions , which have deemed israel ’ s claim to those territories to be illegitimate under international law , and declared the construction of israeli settlements in those territories to be in violation of international law . this article refers to those territories as the “ israeli - occupied territories ” or “ occupied territories ,” in the interest of clarity , not based on any subjective value judgement . <PARA> eu food - labeling requirements <PARA> the eu has relatively strict regulations around how food must be labeled , including requiring that foodstuffs be accurately marked with their country of origin and “ place of provenance ,” if failing to do so would deceive or mislead consumers , or deny them relevant contextual information . in that vein , the eu implemented regulation no . 1169 in 2011 . <PARA> among other measures , regulation 1169 stated that origin labels ( or the absence thereof ) must not deceive or mislead consumers , and that part of the overarching purpose of these labeling requirements was to protect the health of consumers but also to give them information about the origins of food , so that they could make consumer choices that took into account “ economic , environmental , social and ethical considerations .” <PARA> 2015 european commission notice on labeling food from israeli - occupied territories <PARA> in november 2015 , the european commission ( effectively the eu ’ s executive branch ) pulled together those strands of eu policy in an “ interpretative notice ” on “ indication of origin of goods from the territories occupied by israel since june 1967 .” <PARA> roughly speaking , the 2015 notice stated that because the eu does not recognize israel ’ s sovereignty over the occupied territories , foodstuffs that originate in those territories should not be labeled “ made in israel ,” since that would , in the commission ’ s view , violate the principle that “ place - of - provenance ” and “ country - of - origin ” labels must not mislead or deceive eu consumers . <PARA> furthermore , the 2015 notice stated that labels such as “ product from the west bank ” would not be sufficient , because they would not tell the consumer whether the product had been made in israeli settlements in the west bank , or by palestinians there . the notice recommended that labels such as “ product from the west bank ( israeli settlement )” or “ product from the west bank ( palestinian product )” should be used , in order to provide consumers in the eu with the details and context they need in order to make “ an informed transactional decision .” <PARA> 2016 french government notice <PARA> based in part on the european commission ’ s 2015 interpretative notice , france ’ s ministry of the economy and finances published its own notice in november 2016 . that notice informed businesses in france that , based on existing eu law , products originating in the territories of golan and the west bank would have to be labeled as such , and further , products made in israeli settlements there would have to carry even more specific labels . <PARA> two organizations disputed that notice and asked france ’ s conseil d ’ état ( roughly equivalent to the supreme court ) to annul it — the organisation juive européenne (“ european jewish organization ”) and psagot , a company that operates a winery in the psagot settlement in the west bank . both entities argued that the french government was acting beyond its powers by imposing the labeling requirements . <PARA> france ’ s conseil d ’ état (“ council of state ”) delayed making a decision on the notice , and instead sent the matter to the ecj in june 2018 , asking two questions : <PARA> “ does eu law and in particular regulation no 1169 / 2011 of the european parliament and of the council of 25 october 2011 on the provision of food information to consumers , where indication of the origin of a product falling within the scope of that regulation is mandatory , require , for a product from a territory occupied by israel since 1967 , indication of that territory and an indication that the product comes from an israeli settlement if that is the case ? <PARA> “ if not , do the provisions of the regulation , in particular those in chapter vi thereof , allow a member state to require those indications ?” <PARA> the ecj received written submissions from psagot , the organisation juive européenne , the french government and the governments of ireland , sweden , and the netherlands , and oral arguments were heard in april 2019 . <PARA> in june 2019 , ecj advocate general gerard hogan , a former court of appeal and high court judge in ireland , published an opinion on the two questions presented to the court . that opinion , which is not legally binding on the court , advised that : <PARA> on june 13 , hogan laid out his reasoning in a detailed opinion that can be read in full here . in brief , he argued that : <PARA> the crux of hogan ’ s argument can be summarized in the following section from his opinion : <PARA> on the question of whether an individual eu member state could impose its own national requirements for mandatory “ place of provenance ” labeling for food originating in the occupied territories , hogan ’ s reasoning was fairly straightforward . one article in regulation 1169 of 2011 , according to hogan , allowed individual member states to impose such geographic labeling requirements , but only if there was an inextricable link between the place where a food product originates and the quality of the food product . since this quality consideration didn ’ t arise in the specific case of the occupied territories , that provision of eu law didn ’ t apply . <PARA> if the ecj eventually rules in accordance with hogan ’ s advice , the legal consequences would be somewhat complicated , but the practical consequences less so . since hogan ’ s opinion held that , under eu law , individual eu member states could not require mandatory “ israeli - occupied territory ” or “ israeli settlement ” food labels , the french government ’ s 2016 notice would likely be annulled by the french conseil d ’ état , just as those disputing it had requested . <PARA> however , since hogan ’ s opinion also held that eu law did require such labels , those labels would ultimately end up pervading throughout the eu , including in france . <PARA> regardless of one ’ s own personal opinion of it , hogan ’ s detailed analysis and advice to the ecj was explicitly founded on the eu ’ s long - standing policy regarding the legality of israel ’ s annexation of the occupied territories , and the construction of israeli settlements there , in combination with existing eu law regarding food labeling requirements . <PARA> far from recommending mandatory labeling of products as “ jewish ” or “ jewish - made ,” hogan ’ s opinion never once even mentioned judaism , nor the religious affiliation or ethnic background of any producer of food in the occupied territories or israeli settlements . nor did the french government ’ s 2016 notice ( the subject of the dispute before the ecj ) make any such references , nor did the european commission ’ s 2015 interpretative notice make any such references . <PARA> as of aug . 15 , the ecj had not ruled on this issue . however , if it does rule in accordance with hogan ’ s advice , it will be on the basis of what the law requires , not any religious or ethnic considerations . in the introduction to his opinion , hogan emphasized that ecj would view the issue as “ a purely legal matter ,” adding that “ nothing in either this opinion or in the ultimate judgment of the court should be construed as expressing a political or moral opinion .” <PARA> the claim that the eu was about to require “ jewish - made ” labels for food products was a gross misrepresentation of the facts , and we therefore issue a rating of “ false .”
false	a hoax urging service station customers to exercise caution when pumping gas appeared first on the internet in early june 2000 : <PARA> in common with other aids - infected needle scares ( e . g ., syringe attacks in movies houses and dance clubs and contaminated needles in payphone coin returns ), this rumor plays upon our fear of contracting a dread disease through the pursuit of ordinary and harmless activities . <PARA> there is no abraham sands with the jacksonville police department : someone just invented a name to make this “ warning ” look authoritative . no newspaper stories from that city made any mention of sands , which is unusual ( to say the least ) about a department ’ s spokesperson ; jacksonville is served by a sheriff ’ s office , not a police department ; a phone call to the jacksonville sheriff produced the response that they ’ d never heard of abraham sands ; and he wasn ’ t listed with the rest of the personnel on the city of jacksonville sheriff ’ s office web site . no news stories out of florida confirmed the e - mail ’ s claim that 17 people had been injured by these attacks , the city of jacksonsville sheriff ’ s office said the whole thing was a hoax , and the centers for disease control in atlanta stated they were not aware of any cases where hiv had been transmitted by a needle - stick injury outside of a health care setting : <PARA> although there have been a few isolated reports of copycat pranksters leaving needles in public places ( including gas pumps , such as an incident in may 2017 ) in the wake of this hoax , none of those incidents has involved a needle bearing any traces of hiv . no matter how it is reworded , the “ captain abraham sands ” message is naught but anotherhoax dreamed up by someone intent upon enjoying the sight of people thrown into a panic over nothing .

mixture	mixture <PARA> what ’ s true : white house staffer barvetta singletary was arrested and charged with assault after discharging a gun during a domestic dispute with her boyfriend ( a capitol police officer ) in august 2015 . <PARA> what ’ s false / unproven : singletary shot at a police officer because he was a cop , was trying to kill the victim , reported directly to president obama , and her arrest was ignored by large media outlets . <PARA> examples : [ collected via e - mail and twitter , october 2015 ] <PARA> origins : in early august 2015 , 37 - year - old white house staffer barvetta singletary was arrested and charged with first - degree assault , second - degree assault , and reckless endangerment following a domestic dispute with her boyfriend . <PARA> as washington television station wrc reported , during an 7 august 2015 domestic dispute singletary allegedly fired one shot towards the sofa on which her boyfriend was sitting ( hitting the floor ) after he refused to disclose the passwords to his cell phones : <PARA> e - mails and social media rumors about singletary that were circulated months after the fact commonly claimed the altercation had occurred “ last friday ,” an ambiguity that lent plausibility to the rumor ’ s claim the “ mainstream media ” suppressed reporting of the arrest ( since it hadn ’ t appeared in recent news ). however , the incident was covered at the time it occurred by major mainstream news outlets such as the washington post , usa today , the daily mail , the washington d . c . sun times , fox news , and the new york daily news . <PARA> the fact that the complainant was a police officer was incidental to the story ; singletary shot at him because he was a boyfriend with whom she was involved in a romantic dispute , not because he was a cop . and given that various news reports stated that singletary fired a single round in the direction of the couch where her boyfriend was sitting but hit the floor , it isn ’ t clear whether she actually intended to harm him but missed , or whether she deliberately sent the round into the floor in order to scare her boyfriend ( without injuring him ). <PARA> rumors commonly referred to singletary as a “ special assistant to president obama ,” a term which is technically correct but which caused many social media users to incorrectly infer that singletary reported directly to the president and served him personally in some sort of secretarial or administrative capacity prior to her september 2015 resignation . senior white house staffers are granted the title “ assistant to the president ,” second - tier staffers are called “ deputy assistant to the president ,” and third - tier staffers ( of which singletary was one ) are termed “ special assistant to the president .” according to the white house ’ s most recent staffer salary disclosure report , there are approximately 21 employees serving in the first - tier capacity , 19 in the second - tier of white house assistants , and 59 with the title “ special assistant to the president .” <PARA> singletary had served as a as deputy chief of staff in the house of representatives before being named as a white house staffer in june 2014 : <PARA> on 10 august 2015 , a white house spokesperson released a statement regarding singletary ’ s arrest : <PARA> singletary resigned her white house position the following month . <PARA> originally published : 14 october 2015
mixture	during her life , betsy ross was a craftswoman who made flags . after her death , her name and a historical flag design linked to it took on a life of their own . but much of what is assumed to be true is an emotionally fraught myth . <PARA> over time , betsy ross became something of a legend whose role in the american revolutionary war was the creation of the first version of the stars and stripes . but in the trump era , the meaning of the flag associated with her name has shifted , as illustrated by a meme that circulated on facebook in late september 2019 : <PARA> how did the historical flag dubbed “ betsy ross ,” named after the woman who is often depicted in art work sewing the 13 - star design in her parlor at the behest of george washington , come to represent slavery in the minds of some , as inferred by the meme ? <PARA> the furor started in the summer of 2019 , when clothing brand nike canceled a sneaker design that featured the flag , purportedly after athlete - turned - civil - rights activist colin kaepernick and others raised concerns about it . not only did placing the flag on the air max 1 sneaker give the problematic appearance of celebrating an era in american history in which slavery was legal , critics stated , the flag had also been spotted among extremists at the deadly “ unite the right ” white supremacist rally in charlottesville , virginia , in 2017 . <PARA> the criticism and nike ’ s actions attracted what has become a typical backlash against topics of racial justice in the trump era : hyperbole that fails to directly address the issue at hand : <PARA> since this controversy , many have attempted to defend the betsy ross flag with heavy doses of whataboutism or misdirection . <PARA> the criticism over the shoe design , after all , was not about betsy ross herself . it instead questioned a popular brand for appearing to celebrate an american era in which black people were enslaved , and raised concerns over the the evolution of that flag ’ s meaning , post - charlottesville . <PARA> the facts about ross , the historical person , differ greatly from the myth . although she was born into a quaker family and the quakers were opposed to slavery , her personal views on the subject are unknown because no historical documentation from her point of view ( letters , journals , or other records ) is known to survive . that ’ s largely because ross was not famous until well after her death , according marla r . miller , professor of history at the university of massachusetts at amherst and author of the book “ betsy ross and the making of america .” <PARA> “ there is no document that answers the specific question ” about her views on slavery , miller told us by phone . “ we do know that she was a member of the quaker community , raised in the quaker tradition , and that in these decades , the quaker community increasingly rejected slavery .” <PARA> only slight evidence exists that documents ross ’ work making flags during the war of independence . she was a craftswoman in the upholstery trades . she did make numerous flags for the federal government alongside her daughter , clarissa wilson , particularly in the years before the war of 1812 . the design of the american flag evolved over the course of the revolutionary era , and no evidence exists that any of the flags she made bore the 13 stars - in - a - circle pattern . <PARA> ross did know george washington — he patronized her upholstery business . early documentation of her story given by her daughter asserts that ross was proud of introducing washington to a method of folding that allowed five - point stars to be created with just one cut of the scissors , making production quicker and easier . but ross ’ story , as relayed by her daughter , does not include the claim that she made the first american flag . <PARA> ross was indeed raised in the quaker tradition , although she was forced out of the faith when she married john ross , an anglican . she was widowed and remarried twice , returning to the quaker tradition later in life with the formation of the free quakers after the revolutionary war . <PARA> there ’ s a reason for that lack of historical clarity around the origins of the flag , said marc leepson , historian and author of the book “ flag : an american biography .” during ross ’ lifetime , flags weren ’ t endowed with the type of sanctity characteristic of current norms — so the making of flags wasn ’ t considered noteworthy . <PARA> furthermore , an official flag design didn ’ t exist until president william howard taft signed an order designating one in 1912 . popular images depicting washington crossing the delaware with the betsy ross flag , for instance , are apocryphal . the oldest physical flag with that configuration of stars found to date was made in the early 1800s . <PARA> “ we don ’ t know who made the first american flag ,” leepson told us . “ it wouldn ’ t have been newsworthy that someone made the first flag , because people didn ’ t feel even remotely the same way about it like they do now .” <PARA> adulation of the flag , in the way that it is done now , started in the north at the commencement of the american civil war , leepson said . after the war , it spread nationwide . the symbol of a nation united after a bloody civil war was part of the flag ’ s newfound importance , leepson noted . <PARA> miller theorizes that the story of ross and the first american flag took off because the time period her descendants were going public with it coincided with the women ’ s suffrage movement . it solved a cultural problem by giving a woman an important place in the revolutionary war while doing something domestic and non - threatening , which was sewing . it was solidified in the popular imagination with a public campaign to preserve her historic philadelphia home on arch street . <PARA> no known documentation of betsy ross ’ personally held beliefs about slavery exist , but because she was a member of the quaker community for a significant portion of her life , it ’ s probably a credible assumption that she herself opposed it . however , the origins of the so - called betsy ross flag are apocryphal , which arguably renders her beliefs in relation to that flag ’ s use irrelevant . furthermore , the more recent argument against the use of the flag for mainstream purposes stems from a new evolution of the flag ’ s use by far - right groups at a racist rally in 2017 .
false	on july 12 , 2019 , dozens of social media accounts on facebook and twitter started to spread a fake quote ostensibly uttered by u . s . rep . alexandria ocasio - cortez about how “ private truck drivers are destroying america ”: <PARA> this is not a genuine quote from the congresswoman . <PARA> this quote originated with a junk news article published on bustatroll . org , one of many websites in the america ’ s last line of defense network of junk news websites , in may 2019 . the original article featured a “ satire ” tag over the main image and was filed under the category “ aoc horror stories , fan fiction .” the website also carries a disclaimer explaining that “ bustatroll . org is a subsidiary of the ‘ america ’ s last line of defense ’ network of parody , satire , and tomfoolery , or as snopes calls it : junk news .” <PARA> while this quote originated with a clearly marked satire article , many social media users encountered it in the above - displayed meme form where it was presented without indications of its satirical origins . in fact , many social media users falsely presented this quote as if it were genuine , sharing it with captions such as , “ hey truck drivers . this is what aoc thinks of you ” and “ this is not satire . this is a direct quote ...”
unproven	awareness of the problem and patterns of human trafficking has increased significantly in recent years , leading to efforts to train those who work in fields that often intersect with that form of crime — such as the lodging and transportation industries — to be aware of the common signs of human trafficking activity . groups such as airline ambassadors international ( aai ) and the international air transport association ( iata ), for example , help educate flight attendants to keep an eye out for passengers ( particularly youngsters ) who exhibit the following potential signs of being victims of traffickers : <PARA> that awareness reportedly paid off in the case of alaska airlines flight attendant shelia fedrick , whose reported quick thinking in helping to assist a trafficking victim on a flight in 2011 has since been immortalized in a social media meme : <PARA> public knowledge of fedrick ’ s supposed thwarting of a human trafficking event and rescuing of a young female victim came almost exclusively from a glowing february 2017 nbc news account : <PARA> such news reports seemed to be straightforward and heartwarming accounts of one very tangible success stemming from human trafficking awareness training among flight crews , one that most readers accepted at face value . other more skeptical commenters , however , expressed curiosity that all the reporting on the occurrence seemed to stem from a single source ( nbc news ), the incident didn ’ t hit the news until six years after it took place , accounts of the tale lacked resolution , and the story ’ s details proved impossible to independently verify . <PARA> for example , when aviation and travel journalist christine negroni reported on an incident in which a couple traveling by air with their adoptive daughter were wrongly suspected of being human traffickers by a flight attendant , she noted of the shelia fedrick case that : <PARA> writing in reason , elizabeth nolan brown observed that 2017 news coverage of the then six - year - old incident seemed to come out of the blue , and the timing appeared more than coincidental : <PARA> brown , like negroni before her , also noted that news reports of the girl ’ s supposed in - flight rescue from human traffickers were scant on detail and follow - up , and that none of the entities involved with the story — such as the san francisco police , the san francisco airport , alaska airlines , or the flight attendant herself — would or could provide any corroborating information : <PARA> not only was news reporting on this incident lacking any information about the perpetrator and his fate , but about the putative victim as well . how old was she ? where was she from ? how did she come to fall into the hands of a human trafficker ? ( was she abducted , a runaway , or an adventurous youngster lured by the promise of an enticing job ?) why was the young woman — said to now be a college - age adult who remains in touch with ms . fedrick — not seen or referenced ( even anonymously ) in the story at all ? <PARA> like those before us , we have also been stymied in our attempts to obtain any verifying information about the 2011 human trafficking episode . alaska airlines told us that they “ cannot comment on that incident ” and that they can ’ t put us in touch with shelia because she “ no longer works for alaska .” kalhan rosenblatt ( who did the original reporting on shelia fedrick for nbc news ) hasn ’ t responded to our request for comment . we also contacted christine negroni and elizabeth nolan brown to find out if either had learned anything more about the story since the publication of their original skeptical reports , and they both told us that corroboration remained elusive . <PARA> perhaps , as brown suggested , this tale has some elements of truth to it , but the lack of detail indicates the outcome of the case might not have matched the positive one readers were left to assume : <PARA> either way , as she concluded , “ we can ’ t know , because no one will provide any specifics , nor even confirm or deny that the incident occurred .”
false	origins : on 5 january 2015 , an article titled “‘ f - ck whites ’: black woman brags via twitter about spitting in ‘ white peoples food '” began to circulate via social media . the article in question included a screenshot of what may or may not have been an actual tweet , and a single paragraph : <PARA> bubba conroy is ‘ getting back ’ at white patrons at mcdonald ’ s for ‘ slavery .’ i know ... it only makes sense if you ’ re a liberal grievance monger . her twitter account has been suspended . <PARA> as the claim stated , the twitter account for <USER> had been suspended or deleted . however , the screenshot of the tweet in question was dated 9 june 2014 . the site did not explain why a tweet from several months earlier suddenly warranted a flurry of concern over the integrity of mcdonald ’ s food . <PARA> there are several suspicious elements of the “ bubba conroy ” controversy . one is that the blog post responsible for the social media outcry often linked to a facebook page <PARA> called “ liberal chick ,” a clear parody account designed to satirize stereotypical progressive ideals . the content was rife with deliberate misspellings and seemed to focus solely on claims initially made by the site that circulated the bubba conroy rumor . <PARA> moreover , the date appended to the tweet ( june 2014 ) was smack in the middle of a larger series of social media hoaxes designed to satirize progressives on social media sites . the most visible achievement of the campaign was the “ end father ’ s day ” prank , which suggested feminists sought to eliminate that holiday from the calendar . while the hoax was quickly rumbled , several media outlets and celebrities were fleeced by the claims . <PARA> issues such as rape , racism , body image , and others were included in the months - long string of media hoaxes : <PARA> the prank was started by 4chan ’ s politically incorrect board , / pol /, in an effort to rile up feminists and make them ( and men ) look like idiots . <PARA> [# endfathersday was ] part of a six -

false	a meme from 2018 attempted to compare the treatment of foreign children incarcerated in territories occupied by forces of nazi germany in 1944 to the children of immigrants placed into custody by u . s . customs and border protection in 2018 . the meme ’ s presentation was a false equivalency that missed the mark in every way imaginable : <PARA> the u . s . government ’ s implementation of a so - called “ zero tolerance ” policy , resulting in migrant children being separated from their parents at the u . s . border and the prolonged detention at times of those children , has drawn heated criticism here and abroad . but the meme ’ s comparison to german nazis is a hyperbolically absurd one . <PARA> the top image in this meme depicts a group of children released by soviet forces when they liberated the auschwitz concentration camp in german - occupied poland in january 1945 . whatever life may be like for children detained in u . s . immigration facilities , it does not involve — as internment at auschwitz did — those youngsters ’ being starved , put to forced labor , subjected to criminal medical experimentation , or being gassed to death . <PARA> moreover , the bottom image in this meme is not from 2018 , has nothing to do with the united states , and does not involve migrant children being held in detention . as documented in numerous news accounts and reports , it ’ s a photograph dating from 2010 , and it and similar pictures capture palestinian children and adults waiting to receive food at a soup kitchen in the west bank city of hebron during the holy month of ramadan . the original photograph has been cropped to remove the stylized metal work and make it appear that the children are being held in some kind of jail or prison cell :
unproven	for well over a century , people have made myriad assertions regarding the medicinal properties of cream of tartar , a cooking ingredient with the chemical name potassium bitartrate . among the claims associated with the potassium - rich compound are that it can be used to manage high blood pressure , to aid in the cessation of smoking , and to soothe muscle aches . <PARA> people have also used it in high doses to “ cleanse ” their bodies in order to lose weight or expunge “ toxins ,” but ingesting extremely high quantities of the chemical is not advisable as it can result in life - threatening cases of hyperkalemia , which is the abnormally high concentration of potassium in the blood . <PARA> recently , an additional claim made of the chemical has gone viral online : that it can serve as a rapid reliever of migraines or other headaches , as exemplified by a well - shared facebook post from 12 september 2018 : <PARA> this assertion is perplexing , as ( historically speaking ) the claims made of cream of tartar have not typically included efficacy against headaches ( and some cookbooks geared toward people prone to headaches even warn that the ingredient could itself be a cause of migraines ). therefore , it is difficult to pinpoint the origin of the concept of cream of tartar as a headache remedy , or the purported science underlying it . the most explicit online formulation of the notion comes from a 2015 post on the website “ hello lovely living ,” which posits cream of tartar as a cure , or “ antidote ”, for the largely unsubstantiated medical malady known as “ msg poisoning ”: <PARA> the concept of msg poisoning is not generally supported by scientific inquiry , the u . s . food and drug administration ( fda ) does allow that unrealistically high doses could potentially trigger mild headaches and other symptoms . “ although many people identify themselves as sensitive to msg ,” the fda wrote in a statement , “ in studies with such individuals given msg or a placebo , scientists have not been able to consistently trigger reactions .” <PARA> the “ source ” that hello lovely living ( along with several other websites making the same claim ) referenced was the conspiracy - and supplement - peddling website natural news , whose founder is an occasional guest host for alex jones ’ s infowars broadcasts . in a natural news post written by an “ herbalist and a classical homeopath ”, cream of tartar was listed as a potential treatment for msg poisoning because it serves to reduce the alkalinity in one ’ s body , a notion aggressively at odds with any medical science . <PARA> the concept of “ alkalizing ” one ’ s body for health purposes is one of the most common tropes in the pseudoscientific natural health world , and it relies on the false notion that one can affect their blood or cellular ph through diet . <PARA> unless you were ingesting a substance such as straight methanol , which would damage your kidneys and prevent them from regulating your body ’ s blood ph , nothing you consume is going to affect the ph of anything but your urine . blood and intracellular ph exist within an extremely narrow and precise range meticulously and constantly maintained by various bodily respiratory and excretory functions . as stated in an october 2013 paper in the british journal of nutrition , this is true unless one has specific pathologies that prevent the body from sustaining those functions : <PARA> with these facts in place , it is clear that the claim of headache relief efficacy as conveyed on viral websites relies on the debatable existence of msg poisoning as a cause of migraines , as well as the demonstrably impossible notion that one can change blood or body ph through diet . in our view , that makes this specific proposed mechanism for its efficacy untenable and unequivocally false . we also note that such a claim provides no remedy for alleviating migraines caused by anything other than the dubious malady of “ msg poisoning .” if the anecdotal reports of cream of tartar ’ s efficacy against headaches are real , it apparently works via a different mechanism than the ones proposed on the websites suggesting it to be a remedy .

mixture	in march 2016 , several warnings circulated on facebook stating that methamphetamine supplies , and the ingredients used to create meth for recreational drug use , could be contaminated with the virus for the deadly disease ebola . while the most popular version of this facebook message claimed that the ebola contamination affected meth users in hot springs , arkansas , other iterationsmentioned various locations that included cities in the states of california , oklahoma , texas , washington and kentucky : <PARA> regardless of the locations mentioned in these warnings , they all featured nearly verbatim language and a generic “ breaking news alert ” graphic — the hallmark of fake news hoaxes . while police departments may appreciate drug users ’ voluntarily turning their meth in due to fears of ebola contamination , these messages are an obvious jape . <PARA> the exact origins of the joke warnings are unclear , but we did find at least one police department facebook page that reproduced one of them . on 23 march 2016 , the grayson police department posted on facebook that their warning had been “ tongue in cheek ” and that the ruse resulted in no arrests :

false	origins : as <PARA> fashionable as it <PARA> has become lately to ascribe all sorts of racist origins to ordinary words ( as if we could eradicate unsavory aspects of our history by simply eliminating a good chunk of our <PARA> vocabulary ), the slang use of “ buck ” to mean “ dollar ” has nothing to do with slaves or slavery . <PARA> the use of “ buck ” to mean “ money ” came about , as one might expect , from the days when a deerskin was a common medium of exchange . the term appears as early as 1748 in the journal of conrad weiser , who wrote , while traveling through indian territory ( in what is now ohio ) in 1748 , “ he has been robbed of the value of 300 bucks .” a hundred years later , with the deerskin no longer a significant unit of trade , use of the word “ buck ” had shifted to a more general reference to the dollar .

true	an american sign - making company prompted legal questions about using the presidential seal for commercial gain when it acknowledged in march 2018 that it was manufacturing golf tee markers bearing the official seal for use at trump - owned properties . <PARA> propublica first reported the story in early march for their trump , inc . podcast in which reporters investigate trump ’ s various business ties and deals . a photograph of the markers appeared on eagle sign & design ’ s facebook page in late february : <PARA> an instagram photo ( since deleted ) shared on 4 march showed one of the markers in place at trump international golf course in west palm beach , florida , a short drive from trump ’ s mar - a - lago resort : <PARA> and an image making the rounds on twitter after propublica ’ s article was published allegedly shows an example of merchandise sold in the trump tower gift shop sporting a reproduction of the presidential seal : <PARA> these tees and tchotchkes came under scrutiny because a federal statute prohibits certain uses of the presidential seal : <PARA> propublica cited legal experts who suggested that the trump organization ’ s commercial appropriation of the seal for marketing or branding purposes falls outside what would be considered acceptable use under the law : <PARA> in the wake of the propublica story , a spokesperson for the trump organization told associated press that the tees were a gift from golf club members : <PARA> but reporters from propublica and wnyc said they had examined the order form , which listed the purchaser as trump international . reportedly , eagle sign & design has done other work for trump international in the past . <PARA> despite the trump organization ’ s claim that the replicas were temporary and had been removed , the nonprofit watchdog group citizens for ethics and responsibility in washington ( crew ) issued a statement saying they had nevertheless violated the law : <PARA> previous presidents , including barack obama , george w . bush , and ronald reagan , had items such as golf balls and sets of china made that featured the presidential seal , but they were for personal use or to give out as gifts , not commercial marketing . <PARA> still , legal experts weren ’ t unanimous in the opinion that the trump organization ’ s use of the seal was against the law . yale law professor stephen l . carter wrote that although the commercial appropriation of the symbol can be criticized as “ tacky ,” it doesn ’ t rise to the level of a crime : <PARA> “ the federal statute is constitutional only so long as we read it to ban uses of the seal that are either deceptive or misleading , and nothing else ,” carter observed , noting that any number of items bearing the seal can be purchased ( and legally so ) on amazon . com . “ what the trump organization is doing , or what amazon is doing , or what a publisher touting a book is doing , involves uses that are neither deceptive nor misleading .” <PARA> the extent to which expert opinions differ on this is probably best reflected in the fact that trump international announced the removal of the markers within days of their legality being questioned .
false	the washington redskins have proved to be a time - tested election predictor . in the previous 15 <PARA> elections , if the washington redskins have lost their last home game prior to the election , the incumbent party has lost the white house . when they have won , the incumbent has stayed in power . <PARA> this election year , that deciding game takes place on sunday , october 31 ... vs . green bay . <PARA> go pack !!! <PARA> origins : our desire to understand and assert some control over the world around us is often manifested by our attempts to find predictive signs that enable us to prognosticate events — even when there is no seeming connection between predictor and event . sometimes one natural phenomenon supposedly forecasts another , as in the belief that a <PARA> groundhog ‘ s seeing his shadow on february 2 portends another six weeks of winter . in other instances the linkage is between affairs of mankind , as in the superstition that the winner of football ’ s super bowl augurs that year ’ s stock market performance ( or vice - versa ). <PARA> one item of this ilk which gained currency in 2004 maintained that the results of the last game played at home by the nfl ’ s redskins ( a football team based in the national capital , washington , d . c .) before a u . s . presidential election foretold the winner of that contest . if the redskins won their last home game before the election , the party that occupied the white house continued to hold it ; if the redskins lost that last home game , the challenger from the out - of - office party unseated the incumbent party . and up until that 2004 election , the redskins indicator had a rather remarkable record : since 1936 , the earliest <PARA> presidential election year in which the current redskins franchise played under that team name , the team ’ s results had currently predicted the outcome of 17 straight presidential contests . <PARA> reality finally trumped coincidence in 2004 , however : despite the green bay packers ’ 28 - 14 defeat of the redskins at the latter ’ s home field on 31 october , presaging a victory for democratic challenger john kerry in upcoming the presidential election , two days later incumbent president george w . bush was re - elected , breaking the redskins ’ predictive pattern . the redskins indicator failed again in 2012 as washington suffered a 21 - 13 home loss at the hands of the carolina panthers on 4 november 2012 , just two days before that year ’ s election , but republican nominee mitt romney failed to unseat incumbent president barack obama . <PARA> while we don ’ t presume there is anything more behind the phenomenon than random correlation , the redskins indicator can still boast an accuracy rate of 90 % with 18 correct matches out of the last 20 elections : <PARA> that is as far back as the streak goes . in 1932 the washington redskins were neither the redskins nor a washington team : they were the boston braves , and they played in braves field , which they shared with the national league baseball team of the same name . on 6 november 1932 they won at home against the staten island stapletons , 19 - 6 , a result that should have foretold a presidential victory for the incumbent republican party . neither the redskins ’ team name nor their predictive powers were yet evident , however , as president herbert hoover lost to his democratic challenger , governor franklin delano roosevelt of new york , on 8 november 1932 . <PARA> sightings : this redskins home game election predictor was mentioned in an episode of the amc television drama mad men (“ the wheel ,” original air date 18 october 2007 ):

false	the september 2018 announcement of former nfl quarterback colin kaepernick ’ s endorsement deal with nike , inc . was a boon to junk news websites who capitalize on controversy by fabricating clickbait content to promote on social media platforms . <PARA> some of the most notorious of these sites , members of the america ’ s last line of defense network of junk news sites ( llod ), published articles within days of the announcement saying , for example , that nike scotched the deal after kaepernick launched into an “ anti - white rant ” in public ( false ), that nike lost an $ 80 million u . s . government contract because of the deal ( false ), and that former nba star michael jordan had resigned from nike ’ s board of directors in protest of the kaepernick deal ( also false ). <PARA> milking the theme further , llod reported on 9 september that kaepernick was arrested for trespassing after running onto the field during the national anthem “ as a publicity stunt ” at an nfl game in san francisco : <PARA> this item was followed by an “ update ” saying nike had fired kaepernick because of the stunt : <PARA> none of this was true . kaepernick wasn ’ t present at the 9 september game between the 49ers and minnesota vikings ( nor did that game occur in san francisco ). in fact , the closest kaepernick got to an nfl game that weekend was tweeting a message of solidarity with two miami dolphins players who took a knee during the anthem before a game against the tennessee titans : <PARA> unless he was tweeting from a jail cell , that in itself proves that kaepernick wasn ’ t arrested . and if he wasn ’ t arrested , nike had no cause to cancel the endorsement deal . <PARA> in point of fact , despite all the controversy surrounding kaepernick because of the “ take a knee ” protests he started in 2016 , nike has shown no signs of reneging on the endorsement deal , which has been good for the company . their online sales were up 31 percent over the previous year according to one estimate , and bloomberg reported that nike ’ s stock price had recovered from a temporary dip in the immediate aftermath of the announcement of the deal . <PARA> america ’ s last line of defense is a political trolling misinformation network that bill themselves as purveyors of “ satirical ” fiction aimed at mocking conservative political viewpoints .
false	flying commercially requires that we entrust our continued existence to others — namely , the engineers who built the plane , the ground crew that maintains it , and the flight crew that takes it into the skies . that sense of not being in charge of our fate , of instead having to helplessly place it in the hands of others , magnifies our more ordinary flying - related anxieties that have to do with the speed and heights attained via that mode of travel . <PARA> when those anxieties are teamed with the typical mistrust of big business harbored by the average consumer ( who sees it as impersonal and profit - driven to the point of irresponsibility ), all manner of wild beliefs can result . in the case of the ‘ crash ’ or ‘ brace ’ position the air industry recommends in the event of an impending mishap , those beliefs focus upon the presumed reason for turning oneself into a pretzel even as eternity beckons . surely , says logic , leaning forward and covering my head with my hands isn ’ t going to keep me alive if this thing falls from the sky , so there must be some other reason the airlines want me to do this . <PARA> that line of reasoning has resulted in two fanciful explanations . first , that due to the relative sizes of wrongful death versus injury awards , airlines would rather have us pushing up daisies than disabled and so work to ensure our demise when one of their planes is going down . better to snap our necks on impact and so be done with us than risk some of us surviving the crash and successfully suing for millions . in a more charitable form of the rumor , the airlines ’ motivation for getting us to crouch in a death - dealing pose is their desire to spare us needless suffering : since we ’ re all doomed anyway , better a quick exit than a slow one . alternatively , their interest is said to lie in having a neat accident scene . post - crash , says this version of the belief , the airlines ’ priority is not our welfare but rather accurate record - keeping , and our having been in the ‘ brace ’ position at impact guarantees them an easier job of matching up body parts with the passenger list of a downed aircraft . <PARA> mistrust and farfetched rumors aside , adopting the ‘ brace ’ or ‘ crash ’ position when impact is imminent does indeed work to preserve lives in an air disaster . as australia ’ s civil aviation safety authority ( casa ) points out , “ over 70 % of airline accidents are survivable . 71 % of people who die in survivable crashes , do so after the aircraft comes to a complete stop . in many cases its because they are unprepared for the crash .” <PARA> according to the federal aviation administration , there are two primary reasons for bracing for impact , neither of which has to do with quickly dispatching those who were about to die anyway or better preserving what will be left of them post - crash so as to speed identification of bodies . one purpose is to reduce flailing , and the other is to decrease secondary impact . flailing can be cut back by having the seat occupant in some manner flex , bend , or lean forward over his legs . secondary impact can be lessened by positioning the body ( particularly the head ) against the surface it would strike during impact . reduction of either or both of these results in fewer and less severe injuries . <PARA> a particularly memorable 1989 air disaster in which 47 of those aboard died and an additional 74 were injured prompted recommendation of changes to the then prescribed ‘ brace ’ position . analysis of the injuries sustained in the 8 january 1989 crash of british midland flight 92 onto the embankment of the m1 motorway in england ( which has come to be known as the kegworth crash ) showed that many of them had been caused by passengers ’ legs flailing against seat backs and luggage restraint bars and that certain small changes to the position adopted by passengers just prior to a crash would reduce the incidence of such traumas . <PARA> the modified “ brace for crash ” position requires passengers to keep their feet further back than their knees as they bend the upper portion of their bodies forward , and to wear their seat belts as tight and as low on their torsos as they can . if seatbacks in front are not reachable , passengers bend from the waist as far as possible , bringing their chests down onto their thighs , their arms around or behind their legs and tucked in against their bodies . if seatbacks are within reach , passengers rest their heads against them , place their hands one over the other on top of their heads ( but without intertwining their fingers ), and tuck their forearms in against each side of their faces . <PARA> reporting on the east midlands boeing crash , a medical journal noted : <PARA> that same report stated that “ bracing maximizes the chance of uninjured survival .” <PARA> intriguingly , in 2009 we encountered another airline disaster rumor related to the brace position one :
false	we started receiving the above - displayed photograph ( of a woman and a man leading a horse and a large dog through a park - like area ), without any accompanying explanation , in march 2007 . a few weeks later , someone added text identifying the dog as “ hercules , the world ’ s biggest dog .” <PARA> this information is accurate ( in the sense that an english mastiff named hercules owned by a massachusetts man was once recognized as the world ’ s heaviest dog ), but it doesn ’ t have any connection to the dog shown in the image displayed above , which clearly does not match a newspaper photograph of the real hercules ( and his owner ): <PARA> ( we note that the term “ biggest dog ” is somewhat ambiguous and is used here to mean “ heaviest dog ” rather than “ tallest dog .” guinness currently assigns the latter title to zeus , a great dane who measured 44 in . and passed away in 2014 .) <PARA> an english mastiff named kell , described as “ weighing 21 stone ( 294 lbs .), taller than a shetland pony , and more than six feet long ,” was previously described as the “ world ’ s heaviest dog ,” but it ’ s unclear whether she was still alive at the time the “ hercules ” photograph began circulating . ( different newspaper articles from 2001 referred to her as both living and dead , and we could find nothing but brief , indefinite mentions of her after early 2002 . if she were still alive , why she ceded the “ world ’ s heaviest dog ” title to hercules would be puzzling , because news accounts generally listed her as being slightly heavier than hercules .) <PARA> also , the dog pictured above looks to be a neapolitan mastiff rather than an english mastiff . if so , the canine would appear to be either a digital manipulation or a freakishly large example of its breed , because adult neapolitan mastiffs typically reach a height of 24 - 31 inches at the shoulder . ( contrast , for example , the above image with other photographs demonstrating the size of neapolitan mastiffs relative to people . adult neapolitan mastiffs typically reach a height of 24 - 31 inches at the shoulder .) <PARA> another image shows the same scene from the rear :
unproven	the black lawn jockey is typically thought of as a piece of racist memorabilia , but a viral facebook post in january 2016 sought to reverse that image by claiming that these miniature statues were actually used to aid slaves traveling on the underground railroad and were therefore the least racist items that could be displayed in front of a home : <PARA> this notion isn ’ t a new theory . charles blockson , the curator of the afro - american collection at temple university in philadelphia , believes that the lawn jockey is frequently misunderstood and is actually a positive and supportive figure for african - americans : <PARA> the origin of the lawn jockey figure is often attached to the legend of jocko graves . according to the river road african american museum , jocko graves was the 12 - year - old son of a free black man who wanted to help revolutionary war commander - in - chief george washington cross the delaware river to attack hessian forces in trenton , new jersey , in december 1776 . graves was too young to join washington on the crossing , so he reportedly volunteered to watch the general ’ s horses instead ; unfortunately , young graves froze to death in the effort . moved by the boy ’ s sacrifice , washington supposedly commissioned a statue in graves ’ honor which became the prototype for the modern lawn jockey : <PARA> this theory , however , is likely not rooted in fact . in 1987 , ellen mccallister clark , a mount vernon librarian , wrote that historians there had found no record or account of a person named jocko graves : <PARA> the jim crow museum also pointed out some problematic issues with the idea that lawn jockeys were used to help slaves make their way to freedom through the underground railroad : <PARA> david pilgrim , curator of the jim crow museum , acknowledged that no consensus explanation existed for the lawn jockey , and that the common legends about their origins are not currently supported by much evidence . nonetheless , he doubted that those displaying black lawn jockeys were aware of the legends concerning “ jocko graves ” or the underground railroad :

false	if you ’ re looking for security tips or best practices for preventing your information ( and money ) from being stolen at an atm , you can turn to organizations such as the american bankers association , law enforcement agencies , or the bank that issued your card . on the other hand , you ’ re probably better off avoiding advice from unsourced social media posts . <PARA> in november 2018 , many facebook and twitter users encountered a message claiming that pressing the cancel button twice before swiping their cards at atm machines would prevent their pins from being stolen : <PARA> this message did not originate with law enforcement , a financial institution , a cybersecurity firm , or any other authoritative source ( although some versions referenced a vague “ banker friend “). nor did this bit of advice specify what form of atm fraud it would putatively deter . although it ’ s possible that some particular atm theft scheme exists which might be thwarted by a user ’ s pressing the machine ’ s clear button twice ahead of a transaction , this advice will not work as a general safety mechanism . <PARA> the most common methods for capturing account information and pins via compromised atms are : <PARA> 1 ) the installation of a false front on an atm . <PARA> 2 ) the installation of a card “ skimmer ” ( i . e ., a device attached to a card reader slot which copies information ). <PARA> 3 ) the installation of a “ lebanese loop ” ( i . e ., a small plastic device with a barb that holds a card back in the machine ). <PARA> 4 ) the installation of an overlay on top of the numeric atm pad to capture pins . <PARA> 5 ) the installation of hidden cameras to record user keystrokes ( including the entry of pins ). <PARA> none of these schemes is likely to be thwarted by pressing the clear button before a transaction , as none of them relies upon “ front - loading ” the encrypted pin pad with input . <PARA> we perused the security advice offered by a variety of institutions and found no organization recommending the “ double cancel ” input method . <PARA> instead , the most common pin safety tips are the following : <PARA> when we reached out to the american bankers association to verify whether they had heard of this advice , or if they themselves had ever recommended atm customers to press “ cancel twice ” in order to prevent their pins from being stolen , they told us that “ this was not something that we have heard of ” and offered some additional atm safety recommendations : <PARA> david tente , the executive director of the atm industry association , told us that this claim was “ completely false ”: <PARA> hitting the “ cancel ” button twice before using an atm may not have any downside , but users shouldn ’ t expect this procedure to do much of anything to keep their information safe from thieves and scammers .

false	origins : in june 2013 the discovery channel launched a promotional campaign for the august 4 premiere of “ shark week ,” a popular week - long annual event in which the cable channel airs seven days of shark - related programming to educate , entertain , and terrify viewers with features on the sharp - toothed sea denizens . <PARA> the first spot in that promotional campaign was one which featured a live news report about snuffy the seal , who had washed up on shore injured and dehydrated , and after two weeks of medical care and rehabilitation was being re - released into the ocean with a good deal of pomp and ceremony — only to be chomped by a leaping shark as he was being lowered into the water : <PARA> the video then shows the horrified reactions and chaos among the onlookers at the calamity befalling snuffy ’ s “ triumphant return to the sea ,” cutting back from the on - scene reporter to the anchor in the studio , who starts to exclaim “ holy sh ...” before being interrupted by a “ shark week ” drop screen displaying the tag line “ it ’ s a bad week to be a seal ... for the rest of us it ’ s pretty awesome .” <PARA> although there seems to be some confusion about the nature of this video clip , the “ shark week ” commercial is just that , a commercial . it <PARA> isn ’ t footage taken from a real event , but rather a dramatization staged as a fake news report and intended to be funny or horrific , depending upon one ’ s point of view . ( note how the video is carefully staged so as not to be too gruesome : viewers don ’ t actually see the shark chomping snuffy the hapless seal at the apex of its leap ; instead , an onlooker strategically comes into the frame just at that point to block the view of the seal , then moves away as the shark hits the water .) <PARA> the “ shark week ” commercial has met with mixed reactions ranging from amusement to shock at the seemingly real event depicted to outrage that the discovery channel would portray harm to animals ( even in fictionalized form ) in order to promote its programming .
false	ubiquitous cigarette advertisements of the mid - 20th century often touted to consumers that smoking particular brands of cigarettes actually provided health benefits — or at least caused less damage than rival brands . cigarettes were frequently endorsed by doctors and dentists , and they were promoted with an array of medical - sounding claims ranging from “ less irritating to the nose and throat ” to “ improves digestion ” to “ helps maintain slender figures .” <PARA> the nadir of such dubious advertising would seemingly be an ad for winston brand cigarettes that employed the slogan “ taste isn ’ t the only reason i smoke ” and featured a pregnant woman disdaining the notion that smoking while pregnant could result in low birth weight , proclaiming that “ an easy labor ” and “ a slim baby ” was a “ win - win ” scenario : <PARA> this “ when you ’ re smoking for two ...” graphic was just a fabrication and not a genuine vintage print advertisement , however . it was the winner in a “ bad ads ” photoshop competition hosted by the worth1000 website ( now designcrowd ), in which participants were challenged to “ create a failed ad campaign — a parody of an ad that wasn ’ t quite right in one way or another .” <PARA> as for real cigarette ads , the following is a true example of one that perhaps can ’ t be beat for irony in light of modern medical knowledge :

true	a passing detail in garrett m . graff ’ s chilling book raven rock : the story of the u . s . government ’ s secret plan to save itself — while the rest of us die ( simon & schuster , 2017 ) caught the eye of a vigilant snopes reader , who wrote in to ask : <PARA> the subject is briefly broached on page xxii of the book ’ s introduction , in which graff recounts the history of u . s . efforts to prepare in advance for national catastrophes such as nuclear war : <PARA> there should indeed be at least a few baby boomers who remember such signs , which according to contemporaneous press reports were erected along designated roadways as early as 1951 as part of a nationwide civil defense preparedness initiative launched by the truman administration ( making them older than eisenhower ’ s interstate highway system , which wasn ’ t authorized until 1956 ). the effort was driven by two events : the soviet union had conducted its first atom bomb test in 1949 , and , north korea , with the backing of both the u . s . s . r . and china , had attacked south korea the following year , raising the specter of a nuclear confrontation . <PARA> beginning with the publication of a civil defense manual ( nicknamed the “ blue book ” for the color of its cover ) aimed at all levels of government in september 1950 and culminating later that year in the creation of the federal civil defense administration ( fcda , a precursor to today ’ s fema ), the truman administration conceived an emergency management system that issued guidance from the top while delegating the nuts and bolts of implementation to state and local entities . <PARA> for example , a section of the blue book calling for the creation of emergency transportation networks to facilitate both military and civilian use of the roadways didn ’ t specify precisely how it was to be done : <PARA> local civil defense coordinators charged with developing these plans set about the task with varying degrees of urgency . new york city was among the first municipalities to undertake planning for emergency traffic control , with civil defense director arthur w . wallender announcing in february 1951 that the use of certain roadways would be restricted in the event of enemy attack , and unauthorized movement of civilian vehicles prohibited . on 9 february , the new york times published a photograph of workmen erecting a sign on the outskirts of the city that read “ in the event of an enemy attack on new york city this highway will be closed to all traffic except civil defense & military vehicles .” <PARA> one of these signs shows up briefly ( at the 3 : 19 minute mark ) in the short film “ our cities must fight ,” produced for the federal government in 1951 by archer productions ( the same outfit responsible for the nuclear survival training film now regarded as a quintessential example of cold war kitsch , duck and cover ): <PARA> massachusetts civil defense officials offered insights into the reasoning behind restricting civilian traffic : <PARA> they further explained that : <PARA> some state and local governments took years to produce tangible results . for example , maryland ’ s emergency transportation plan wasn ’ t rolled out until july 1953 and virginia ’ s “ closed in event of enemy attack ” signs didn ’ t go up until 1954 — by which time some emergency management experts were rethinking the wisdom of restricting civilian access to highways . among them was eisenhower ’ s fcda administrator val peterson , among whose top priorities was responding to the u . s . s . r .’ s development of a hydrogen bomb . <PARA> a 14 july 1954 editorial in the syracuse , new york newspaper the post - standard reflected the shift in strategic thinking that had occurred : <PARA> by 1955 , according to a gannett news service report , peterson was openly calling for the signs to be torn down , a proposal that didn ’ t sit well with some local civil defense directors : <PARA> stay up they did ( at least for a few more years ), but their extinction would be inevitable thanks to the reality of the h - bomb and the eisenhower administration ’ s stated preference for mass evacuation over “ duck and cover .” <PARA> by 1958 , newspaper columnists like pulitzer - winning marquis childs were ridiculing the signs as vestiges of a dysfunctional civil defense system : <PARA> in 1961 , virginia sen . a . willis robertson ( at that time the newly elected chairman of the joint senate - house defense production committee ) characterized the signs as a waste of taxpayer money : <PARA> we were unable to ascertain when the last of the “ highway closed in event of enemy attack ” signs finally came down , though we ’ re fairly sure none survived beyond the 1960s , after which point the only published mentions of them we found were couched in the past tense . a february 1977 article in the hamilton , ohio journal - news reminded readers that they had once existed , at the same time noting that they seemed to have “ faded from the highway landscape .”
false	a message purportedly posted to facebook in december 2015 that accurately predicted numerous events which came to pass in following six months ( a mass shooting as well as the deaths of prince , muhammad ali , kimbo slice and a gorilla ) was widely circulated on facebook in june 2016 : <PARA> although this message appeared on facebook with a date of 26 december 2015 , the user who posted it , pablo reyes , didn ’ t actually write or post the message on that date . reyes edited an unrelated message from that date to make it appear as if he had predicted the future . the december 2015 message he edited originally read : <PARA> the evidence is in reye ’ s edit history . facebook allows users to edit their posts , but a post ’ s edit history can be checked by clicking on the menu in the upper right - hand corner of a post . checking the edit history for reye ’ s purported prognostication clearly shows that his “ prediction ” was made on 12 june 2016 , after the events he described had already taken had place :

unproven	ask anyone who has experienced a urinary blockage due to kidney stones and they will tell you there is nothing fun or remotely pleasant about the experience . caused when salt and mineral residues form small “ stones ” inside the kidneys that move and become stuck in the ureter ( the passageway via which urine passes from the kidneys to the bladder ), a kidney stone blockage often results in severe pain , bleeding , nausea , and vomiting . <PARA> sometimes , especially when the stones are small , they eventually pass through the ureter and are excreted without medical intervention . larger stones usually require treatment , which may involve one or more of the following : medication to relax the walls of the ureter ; extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy ( eswl ) to break up the stones into smaller pieces so they can pass in the urine ; ureteroscopy , a minimally invasive surgery in which a small tube is inserted into the urinary tract to break up the stones and remove them ; or a surgical procedure to excise the stones if they are very large . <PARA> or , according to urologist and professor emeritus in the department of osteopathic surgical specialties at michigan state university dr . david wartinger , do , you could consider the lower - cost alternative of taking a ride on the big thunder mountain roller coaster at walt disney world in orlando , florida and letting the force of gravity do the work . <PARA> wartinger made a media splash in september 2016 by publishing a study in the peer - reviewed journal of the american osteopathic association stating that experiments he performed using a lifelike silicone model of the human urinary tract confirmed that “ roller coaster facilitation of calyceal renal calculi passage ” ( i . e ., taking a roller coaster ride to facilitate the passage of kidney stones ) may be a feasible alternative to standard medical treatment in some cases . <PARA> predictably , the news also made the social media rounds in the simplified form of an image macro : <PARA> wartinger explained how the research came to pass in an interview with the michigan state university publication msu today : <PARA> the anecdotal reports wartinger said he heard from patients resembled ones noted by a taiwanese urologist in a february 2009 article in taiwan today news : <PARA> one of the more interesting findings wartinger reported was that out of the three disney world roller coasters he and his co - researcher tried , only one of the rides achieved the desired result : <PARA> in interviews , wartinger went further than simply reporting the results of his study , to the point of actually proposing a roller coaster ride as an alternative non - medical remedy for kidney stones : <PARA> we hasten to point out that dr . wartinger did not recommend foregoing diagnosis or treatment by a medical professional in favor of taking a roller coaster ride . note , too , that the research was conducted not using actual human subjects , but rather a urinary tract simulator made of silicone ( though the kidney stones used were real ). despite the doctor ’ s enthusiasm , therefore , in the absence of any follow - up research confirming his results , the study cannot be considered conclusive ; it does not suffice to prove that a roller coaster ride is an effective means of dislodging kidney stones . <PARA> all we have , to date , is preliminary evidence suggesting that a ride on disney world ’ s big thunder mountain roller coaster may help some patients spontaneously pass kidney stones ( and only “ very small stones ” at that , according to a urologist familiar with the study consulted by the new york times in 2016 ). <PARA> wartinger indicated as much himself in comments quoted in slate shortly after the study was published . “ this is the validation model for getting the attention to do the human trial ,” he said . no human trials have yet taken place . <PARA> we reached out to wartinger for further comment but had not heard back by publication time .

mixture	the prince of darkness garnered a wicked share of social media buzz in early 2018 , with mentions ranging from reports that chelsea clinton tweeted a friendly new year ’ s shout - out to satan worshipers to the revelation that a “ luciferian ” house of worship had opened its doors in colombia . <PARA> examples of the latter were typically couched in apocalyptic tones and illustrated with lurid images and videos purportedly documenting the church ’ s existence and popularity : <PARA> for starters , the video , which was shot in january 2017 , is entirely unrelated to the images and has nothing to do with a luciferian church , or devil worship in general . on the contrary , it shows hundreds of revelers in riosucio , caldas , a small town in northwestern colombia , participating in the biennial celebration of carnaval del diablo ( carnival of the devil ), described by the web site devils of the americas as a catholic festival : <PARA> by contrast , the images , which date from 2016 and were shot in a different part of the country , depict a “ church ” utterly devoid of parishioners . it was built by a self - styled luciferian high priest and brujo ( sorcerer ) who does business under the assumed name víctor damián rozo ( his real name , according to a profile in the colombian news magazine semana , is héctor londoño villegas ). rozo claims to have followers all over the world . <PARA> he also claims to have built the church ( officially dubbed the luciferian temple , seeds of light ), so worshipers of lucifer would have a place to congregate . in reality , there ’ s little evidence that the building , erected on rozo ’ s own property , serves any other purpose than providing a backdrop for his self - promotional videos . judging from his twitter activity ( under the handle <USER> rozo ’ s primary enterprise is selling so - called “ pacts with the devil ,” the benefits of which include financial enrichment : <PARA> there ’ s a catch , of course . in exchange for his services as a luciferian deal - maker rozo demands a percentage of his clients ’ future incomes . it ’ s hard to determine how successful he has been at this scheme . though he portrays himself as a globetrotting millionaire , the regional newspaper crónica del quindío points out that promotional photos of rozo visiting exotic locales were created by digitally inserting his likeness into existing images . <PARA> in short , although it does exist , colombia ’ s controversial church of lucifer appears to be less a religious ( or anti - religious ) institution than the home base for a bizarre confidence scheme run by its owner , víctor damián rozo . a reporter for vice colombia came to a similar conclusion after peeking behind the curtains of rozo ’ s operation in 2017 . among the deceptions he was caught engaging in was paying local residents a few pesos each to pose as devotees of lucifer :

true	as part of the usual media probing of virtually everything a presidential candidate has ever publicly said or done , in september 2016 multiple news sources reported that libertarian candidate gary johnson had once proclaimed that efforts to combat global warming were futile because the sun would eventually engulf and destroy the earth : <PARA> these reports originated with comments johnson made back on 11 august 2011 during an appearance at a national press club luncheon . when johnson , a former two - term governor of new mexico , was asked by moderator mark hamrick about how he viewed the issue of climate change and what the government ’ s role in mitigating it should be , he responded as follows : <PARA> there ’ s no question that johnson said this , but what he meant when he said it is debatable . although he did suggest that money currently being dedicated to address global warming was being spent ineffectively , he didn ’ t literally say that we should do nothing about global warming because the sun will someday expand and destroy the earth regardless . <PARA> so what did johnson mean ? his remarks clearly indicate that he believes global warming is anthropogenic ( i . e ., caused by man ) and that he is aware the destruction of the earth by its sun is billions of years off , so clearly he wasn ’ t speaking from total scientific ignorance . <PARA> remarks johnson made earlier in the luncheon reinforced that he didn ’ t actually say we should ignore global warming because it ’ s not not a serious issue and / or because non - anthropogenic warming will kill us all eventually regardless , but rather that some current proposals would involve the expenditure of huge amounts of money to achieve disproportionately small results , and those monies would therefore be better directed elsewhere ( i . e ., towards different solutions to global warming or in other ways ): <PARA> but still , why did he mention the ultimate destruction of the earth by the sun billions of years from now ? what was his point ? perhaps his statement was , as some critics content , a flippant , ridiculous , or ignorant justification for not spending much money on global warming and assigning the issue a low priority because it ’ s an unsolvable problem in the long term . or perhaps johnson was trying to make a point by satirizing those who would defend spending trillions of dollars now on approaches that may do little to ameliorate the problem ( rather than waiting for better or most cost - effective solutions ), under the guise that they ’ re taking a “ long - term view ” — that is , demonstrating the folly of stretching a “ long - term view ” to an absurd extreme . <PARA> which was it ? we can ’ t say for sure , but given that johnson asserted the very same thing during the course of an interview about environmental issues several months later , we ’ d have to come down on the side of the former : <PARA> for what it ’ s worth , the official johnson - weld campaign site reiterates the candidates ’ position that global warming is (“ probably ”) a real and man - made issue , but that government - imposed regulations on the private sector are not an effective means of addressing it :
false	after a devastating pedestrian bridge collapse at florida international university on 15 march 2018 , the national transportation safety board opened an investigation in order to determine exactly what went wrong and who was ultimately responsible for the disaster . <PARA> some corners of the internet couldn ’ t wait for the results of this report , however , and claimed that the true culprit was painfully obvious : women . <PARA> an article published in the days following the bridge collapse reported that the munilla construction management , one of the companies that worked on the fiu - seawater bridge , was a “ female led construction company .” another article claimed that the bridge was constructed by an “ all - women engineering team ,” while a video based off these two articles took this claim one step further and stated that this bridge was constructed by an “ all - female company .” <PARA> these articles both contained a collage of female construction workers and multiple paragraphs explaining why women just aren ’ t meant to do construction : <PARA> the collages featured in these articles show female mcm employees , but not necessarily women who worked on the florida bridge . most of these photographs were pulled from the company ’ s social media posts celebrating women ’ s diversity and not from a post about the project in florida . <PARA> miami - dade county commissioner jose pepe diaz did post several images from the construction site on the morning the bridge was put into place . those photographs showed various politicians and construction company heads , almost all of which were male : <PARA> although the headline for this article blared that “ a female - led construction company built the florida bridge that collapsed ,” the text was void of evidence to prove such a claim . in fact , the body of article outright contradicted its title ( emphasis ours ): <PARA> here ’ s a photograph of mcm ’ s board of directors : <PARA> mcm ’ s board of directors clearly aren ’ t all - female . but what about the construction crew ? the web sites squawker and sandra rose both claim that a woman named leonor flores was the project manager for the fiu bridge : <PARA> this claim , however , appears to be based on a misreading of an article published by the university ’ s official web site on 14 march 2018 . the web site quoted flores , who was a florida international university graduate and who works for mcm , about how she hopes her daughter pursues mathematics in school . the site mentions the new fiu bridge ( the article was published before the collapse ), but it never said that flores was working on this particular project : <PARA> fiu added a statement at the top of their article to clarify that flores did not work on the bridge project “ in any capacity .” <PARA> the only other piece of “ evidence ” provided by these web sites that mcm employed an “ all - female ” team for this project came from a tweet that the company sent on international women ’ s day : <PARA> this single sentence gets multiple things wrong ; flores was not affiliated with the bridge project , the tweet was not sent in the “ hours before the deadly collapse ” and it did not celebrate an “ all - women design team .” <PARA> munilla construction management is not an “ all - female ” company and they did not use an “ all - female ” engineering team to construct the ill - fated fiu - sweetwater bridge . this claim is based on social media posts celebrating international women ’ s day and a misreading of a news article . in other words , there is no basis for this claim . <PARA> the misguided argument posed by these web sites would perhaps have been better served if they had focused on figg bridge designs , another company that worked on the florida project and whose chief executive officer actually happens to be a woman , although the company does not exclusively hire women . linda figg , daughter of company founder eugene figg , was not mentioned in either article . regardless , the company ’ s lead engineer on the project , denney pate , was a man . <PARA> the miami herald reported that a plethora of issues could have caused the fiu - sweetwater universitycity bridge to collapse . although it will likely be some time before the national transportation safety board finishes its investigation , we would be willing to bet that the biological sex of the engineers is not listed as a cause of the tragedy on the final report .

false	the blogger behind sensational stories about a purported “ ground zero mosque ” project that went viral in 2010 is trying to bring the story back for another round of controversy . and her actions have in turn prompted social media posts expressing outrage that a muslim house of worship could be built on the site of the 9 / 11 terrorist attacks in lower manhattan . <PARA> a summary of the issue is this : no mosque is being built at ground zero . the ground zero narrative , criticized by some observers as a manufactured controversy , was initially pushed by pamela geller back in 2010 . that controversy centered on a proposed muslim community center to be constructed at 51 park place in lower manhattan , about three blocks from where the world trade center ’ s twin towers stood before they were struck by two jetliners and collapsed during the sept . 11 , 2001 , terror attacks , killing thousands of people . <PARA> geller runs an eponymous blog where she almost exclusively writes about what she perceives as the misdeeds of muslims . she also co - heads the organization stop islamization of america , which has , as the anti - defamation league reports , “ introduced a growing number of americans to its conspiratorial anti - muslim agenda .” <PARA> on dec . 16 , 2019 , geller published a blog post to the american thinker website in which she reported that “ the news [ of the mosque ] was buried under two dense paragraphs and five large photos in an article in new york yimby about a different project : ‘ construction has also yet to begin on 51 park place , which is slated to become a 71 - foot - tall , 16 , 000 - square - foot islamic cultural center .’ the infamous ground zero mosque project , a long buried effort to build a triumphal mosque at the site of the worst jihad terror attack in american history , is back .” <PARA> geller was referring to a dec . 1 , 2019 , article in the new york real estate development publication new york yimby (“ yes in my backyard ”) about the city ’ s skyline . while the information about the development at 51 park place was somewhat buried in the article , that was likely because it ’ s not new . since at least 2014 news outlets have been reporting that the development plans for 43 - to - 51 park place , a high - rise condominium complex , will incorporate a muslim cultural center and prayer space . <PARA> to be clear , no mosque is being built at 51 park place , and the terms “ mosque ” and “ prayer space ” are not interchangeable , said omar suleiman , professor of islamic studies at southern methodist university and founder of the yaqeen institute for islamic research in texas . <PARA> such prayer spaces are known as “ musalla ,” a word that literally translates to “ prayer space ” in arabic . they are routinely found in predominantly muslim countries in public places such as airports , shopping malls , and hospitals , according to suleiman . one such prayer space inhabited the 17th floor of the world trade center ’ s south tower , which was hit by the second jetliner on 9 / 11 . <PARA> we sent geller questions about her story asking her why she called the development the “ ground zero mosque ” despite its distance from the world trade center site . geller asserted that even though the development is several blocks away from where the twin towers stood , the project is under construction on the site of a building that was demolished due to damage from the 9 / 11 attacks : <PARA> “ ground zero was an area , a zone . the building that was torn down to build this was severely damaged in the 9 / 11 attacks . landing gear from one of the planes that brought down the towers crashed through the building ’ s roof . human remains were found near the building ,” geller wrote . she said she doesn ’ t think a muslim house of worship or cultural center should be built “ in an area that was damaged in the 9 / 11 attacks .” <PARA> a burlington coat factory outlet once stood at 45 - 47 park place , and as the new york times reported , the roof of that building was indeed struck by the landing gear of one of the two jetliners that was crashed into the world trade center . wreckage from that plane was found at the site in 2013 . <PARA> but suleiman noted that muslims were among the casualties on 9 / 11 , and the premise of the “ ground zero mosque ” story is problematic : it presumes muslims don ’ t have the right to worship on a site where other muslims were killed and where their prayer space was destroyed in a terror attack . <PARA> “ even if [ the new development were ] a mosque , it ’ s just pure bigotry to suggest that muslims are the only ones who can ’ t have a place of prayer there , when muslims had a prayer space within the world trade center , and muslims had a significant casualty count as well [ on 9 / 11 ],” suleiman said . “ it ’ s not just muslims we mourn , it ’ s the fact [ that ] this hit all americans equally . it ’ s a tragedy for all americans , including muslims .” <PARA> suleiman declared that these types of stories are particularly hurtful to him because among the muslim victims who died on 9 / 11 was tariq amanullah , someone whom suleiman knew personally . <PARA> “ to squarely put muslims in the ‘ villain ’ category is to intentionally omit history and context , and rob us of our share of being on the side of those who were victimized in the attack ,” suleiman said . <PARA> we also asked geller why she chose to report that the “ ground zero mosque ” is “ back ,” even though the information she repeated about it is not new . she responded that she characterized the issue as such “ because there has been little to no mention of it in years , until the mention i wrote about in my article .” <PARA> that wasn ’ t the case , however . news outlets have been reporting for years about the progress of work at the site . the developer and founder of soho properties , sharif el - gamal , drastically scaled back his original vision of a 13 - story islamic community center and mosque called park51 , electing instead to build a luxury condominium tower now known as 45 park place . in 2014 , the new york times reported of those plans that : <PARA> the times reported again in may 2017 that 45 park place was scheduled to “ open in 2019 with 50 apartments at 45 park place and a much smaller , three - story islamic museum and public plaza , designed by jean nouvel , but no mosque , at 49 - 51 park place ,” where listings for $ 1 million - plus condos are now available . <PARA> new york curbed , a real estate and urban design website , has regularly reported on the site ’ s progress , as have a number of other websites . <PARA> suleiman told us that “ ground zero mosque ” sensationalism is probably resurfacing because it ’ s election season once again , referring to the upcoming 2020 u . s . presidential election . <PARA> “ this is typical election - season islamophobic hysteria ,” suleiman maintained “ it spikes not just in the u . s ., but everywhere . this is what happened in 2010 — the ‘ ground zero mosque ’ story was everywhere , and as soon as the election was over , it completely disappeared .” <PARA> suleiman said the latest recurrence is part of a pattern he calls the islamophobia industry , a network of personalities and websites that “ takes one lie and spins that out to create 100 articles and links , so even if you clarify the one lie , 100 articles pollute google searches .” the goal , he averred , is to create a miasma of suspicion about the muslim community , which isolates it and makes it more vulnerable to attacks . <PARA> “ the machinery they have to churn out these lies is so overwhelming that we just duck and hope people are smart enough to see through it ,” he said .
false	one of the many common household items that provided hours of entertainment during my childhoold after my siblings and i co - opted it as a low - tech “ toy ” was shaving cream — or , more specifically , aerosol cans of shaving cream . it was amazing to us kids how much foamy lather we could produce ( and how much of a mess we could make ) with just a little squirt or two of the stuff , and of course we fantasized about what quantity of foam would be produced by a whole can of the stuff — enough to fill the bathroom , maybe ? we never did quite answer that question definitively , as our abortive experimental attempts along these lines ( performed in a straightforward manner , by holding down the button and trying to empty the can through the nozzle ) resulted not in a foam - filled bathroom , but in a few young behinds being paddled red . <PARA> this childhood fantasy lives on , however , in the form of a belief that freezing a few cans of shaving cream ( either quickly by immersing them in a bath of liquid nitrogen , or more slowly by placing them in a conventional freezer ) and then carefully cutting them open will produce compact , easily transportable lumps of shaving cream material — lumps that , when allowed to thaw , will expand into a foamy cascade of tremendous volume . this concept allows the imagining of a set - up for the perfect prank : freeze a couple of cans of shaving cream , hide the resulting frozen blobs in your victim ’ s car , and make your getaway . some time afterwards ( from hours to days later , depending on the temperature ), while you ’ re far away , the blobs will thaw out and expand into a messy , automobile - filling mass of shaving lather : <PARA> unfortunately , the reality doesn ’ t quite live up to the fantasy , for a few basic reasons : <PARA> as graphic illustrations of these points , we call attention to the work of the folks at cockeyed . com , whose “ how much is inside ” exploits have included emptying an entire can of shaving cream and finding that the results were not as voluminous as expected ( their truer representation of how much comes out of a can be viewed here ), as well as performing the above - referenced experiment of freezing an 11 - oz . can of shaving cream , extracting its contents , and allowing the frozen block of cream to thaw . <PARA> in the latter case , although the thawed block increased in volume by a fairly large proportion ( about 850 %), it still only produced a rather disappointing 12 cups of foam overall — enough to make a fine mess ( if spread about ), but nearly not enough to fill the interior of a typical automobile . <PARA> if you really want to fill up a car with shaving cream , you ’ d best be prepared to invest in at least a few dozen cans of the stuff .
false	in september 2016 , social media users began sharing a video clip that was circulated with the claim that it depicted a nypd officer named frederick soldaat raping a teenage girl who was being held in police custody . <PARA> it is true that at the same time this video was circulating , news reports indicated that a police officer by the name of frederick soldaat had been charged with raping a 15 - year - old girl who had been taken to a police station temporarily to “ cool down ” following an altercation with her parents . however , those events took place in cape town , south africa , and not new york city : <PARA> it ’ s also unclear whether the circulating video captures the incident for which soldaat was charged , or whether it has some other unrelated , possibly non - criminal , origin ( such as a fetish video ).
true	origins : so often the stories about various politicians have nothing to them , but that is not the case here . although not a great deal of information is available , what little we ’ ve been able to discover fits the account given above . <PARA> on 22 december 2003 , president and mrs . bush did visit the shiloh baptist church in alexandria , virginia , for the purpose of recognizing its “ victim to victory angel tree ministry ,” a program which provides christmas gifts to more than 500 , 000 children of inmates each year . the associated press covered their visit , and angel tree itself issued a press statement about the visit from the first family , saying that “ the president and first lady joined the young guests of honor in singing carols , and reading a christmas story . they also helped hand out gifts to approximately 50 children of prisoners at the holiday event .” breakpoint also issued an account of the presidential visit , which includes mr . bush ’ s remarks to those assembled . <PARA> we can ’ t tell from what little information is available how long president and mrs . bush spent with the families of inmates , which might well be the crux of things . although associated press did mention this visit ( but only in passing as part of a far larger article about <PARA> george w . bush attending a menorah lighting ceremony that same week ), most news outlets didn ’ t pick up and run the story . the e - mailed account was right about this story not getting circulated — we ’ re not finding that news of it made its way into many newspapers . as to why the press would choose to pass over the story , keep in mind that presidents and their wives reading to groups of children or visiting the needy and infirm during the holiday season isn ’ t news in and of itself , because they all do it . it is therefore not surprising that the press would choose to expend their resources on what they deemed to be more exciting news stories than the standard festive season gladhanding . yet if colson ’ s account is accurate (“ they stayed long after the cameras were gone to greet every child , to have their picture taken with them , their mothers , and their grandmothers , to talk with them , and to ask questions ”), this wasn ’ t the standard ‘ smile for the cameras then run like heck ’ that has come to be expected from politicians ; it was something more . ( although the press could hardly be expected to report the ‘ something more ’ part since , as described in the account quoted above , they were “ ushered out ” after ten minutes and therefore weren ’ t around to witness it .) <PARA> a cynical way of looking at this christmas visit would be to attribute the president ’ s extra involvement to a desire to draw attention to a pet project — according to the associated press article , “ white house press secretary scott mcclellan said the event was aimed at highlighting bush ’ s initiative for recruiting and training mentors for more than 1 million disadvantaged youth , including 100 , 000 children with parents in prison .” a less cynical view would be to see it as an expression of real support and concern , an act of true charity that came from the heart .
mixture	on 27 july 2018 , an image of a sign reading “ pedophiles are people too ” and “ love is love ” over a rainbow background reminiscent of the lgbtq pride flag started making its way around social media : <PARA> facebook posts were often accompanied by text indicating the sign had been stapled to a telephone pole near a school in oregon : <PARA> portland television station katu confirmed that this sign was briefly posted near a school in the city of west linn , and that it was removed shortly after it was noticed by area residents . <PARA> while it ’ s still unclear who put up this particular sign , it is eerily similar to previous troll campaigns aimed at connecting the lgbtq community with pedophiles . in december 2017 , for instance , users on the internet forum 4chan concocted a false rumor that a “ p ” ( for “ pedosexual ”) was being added to the well known lgbtq initialism . 4chan users were encouraged to spread a photoshopped flyer bearing taglines such as “ love is ageless ,” a more on - the - nose version of the tagline seen on the oregon poster , “ love is love .” <PARA> a similar ruse was circulated on tumblr in june 2018 . that time an image supposedly showing a pride flag for maps ( minor attracted persons ) was shared along with baseless rumors about pedophiles ’ supposedly “ rebranding ” themselves in an effort to gain acceptance into the lgbtq community . <PARA> these campaigns , as well as the “ pedophiles are people too ” poster found in oregon , all push the unfounded notion that the lgbtq community has been party to a concerted effort to legitimize and normalize pedophilia . our previous investigations into these troll campaigns , however , has found that no legitimate lgbtq organizations have created , endorsed , or promoted any such idea . <PARA> cameron whitten , the executive director of the lgbtq community and non - profit q center organization in oregon , said of the mysterious poster that “ it ’ s just very clear that this message was meant to stigmatize and stereotype lgbtq people . at a time when we are facing homophobia , transphobia , it is not helpful for these kinds of harmful messages to be disseminated out .” <PARA> it should also be noted that while these fabricated campaigns have repeatedly attempted to link homosexuality with pedophilia , no such connection has actually been found :

unproven	stories about a stranger slipping into the back seat of a solo woman ’ s car , presumably with ill intentions , have been circulating in various forms both on and off the internet for many years : <PARA> despite the legend ’ s many incarnations and long history , there ’ s little or no record of its ever playing out in real life . it ’ s merely a cautionary tale warning us to be vigilant of our surroundings — there just aren ’ t that many bad guys lurking in backseats to get worried about . <PARA> though there have been rapes wherein the attacker hid in the back seat of an automobile , they are rather rare occurrences ( one example of which took place in the chicago area in march 2013 ). as for carjackings , in the overwhelming majority of them the assailant opens the door and gets into the car while the driver is behind the wheel ; there ’ s little of this “ lurking in the backseat ” bit . <PARA> the legend , unlike many , might originally have been prompted by a real news story : <PARA> even as a horror legend , this one is sexist to the core . as mentioned earlier , the prey is always female and both the evil fiend and the rescuer are male — there are no exceptions to this typecasting ( even though men are far more often the victims of killing by strangers than women are ). both male figures are seen as powerful : the fiend for his evilness and mad intent , the rescuer for his coolness in knowing what to do and his ease in dispatching the fiend : <PARA> the woman , by contrast , is portrayed as completely and irredeemably ineffective . in none of the tellings does she catch on to the source of her peril ; she always needs a man to set the record straight . ( the task of rescuing her from a dangerous situation also falls to a guy ; the woman is never involved in either containing the bad guy until the police arrive or in tussling with him if he tries to escape .) her inability to take care of herself is further driven home by her resolutely acting on the assumption that the man either chasing after her or trying to lure her into the gas station means her harm . unaided , she can ’ t tell friend from foe . <PARA> in those recountings where anyone ’ s ethnicity is mentioned , the man hiding in the car or the rescuer is invariably black . it ’ s easy to see those versions as a racist reaction to anxiety about being attacked by a member of a feared group : the lurking black man represents the perceived menace of his race , waiting for the proper moment when a back is turned to strike ; the rescuer ’ s attempt to warn the victim is ignored because his color marks him as more likely to be an attacker than a protector . <PARA> update : in late 1999 through early 2002 , versions circulating on the internet which involved prospective gang members looking to kidnap a woman for rape reappeared with surprising frequency . these morphing e - mails contained specific city names ( such as chicago or boston ) and names of local chains of gas stations / convenience stores ( such as “ quik trip ,” “ quick trip ,” “ quick stop ,” “ kwik trip ,” “ kwikfill ,” and “ citgo ”). later versions incorporated the ankle slasher motif from another horror legend and posited that the gang initation required prospective members to bring in dismembered body parts from female victims . <PARA> sightings : this legend shows up in the 1983 film nightmares , the 1984 film mr . wrong and the 1998 film urban legend . you ’ ll also spot the “ gas station ” version worked into the plot of an episode of tv ’ s homicide (“ thrill of the kill ”; originally aired 10 november 1995 ) and millennium (“ the pest house ,” original air date 27 february 1998 ). it was also made into a short film titled suspicious in 1995 .
mixture	on aug . 16 , 2019 , huffington post white house correspondent s . v . dáte tweeted that u . s . president donald trump had , at that point in time , spent “ 278 . 5 years of annual presidential salary in taxpayer money to play golf .” this statistic served as a headline to a viral politicus usa article posted the next day . <PARA> assessing the validity of this statistic requires knowledge of two numbers : the president ’ s annual salary and the amount of money trump has cost taxpayers via trips to golf clubs . the first number is easy : it ’ s $ 400 , 000 , as stipulated by congress . the second number is a bit more challenging to derive with precision . the number would necessarily include costs like transportation , security , and other logistical support , but how these items are calculated involves estimates or assumptions . <PARA> huffpost ’ s methodology was what they described as a “ conservative approach ” based on a government accountability office ( gao ) report of trump ’ s first four outings to mar - a - lago as president . one example of the kind of choices people estimating these costs have to make , they noted , concerns how much of the per - hour air force one cost to add to the golf outing calculation : <PARA> the 278 . 5 years of presidential salary would equate to $ 111 , 400 , 000 in total costs up to august 2019 , when dáte tweeted the statistic . this number , to give a sense of the range of estimates , was a bit higher than a figure promoted within the body of the politicus usa article , which cited the trump golf count website as calculating , at the time of their reporting , “ 207 golf trips ... at a cost to taxpayers of $ 108 million and counting .” trump golf count is run by self - described data junkie sophie germain and dedicated to tracking the president ’ s golf time . <PARA> at the time of our reporting here , october 2019 , that website reports that trump has spent $ 109 , 505 , 631 of taxpayer money on visits to golf properties broken down in this way : <PARA> divided by $ 400 , 000 , this total represents 273 . 8 annual presidential salaries — still below the headline claim of 278 . 5 years . these differences are negligible if you take into account how precise the above numbers actually are , however . as washington post fact - checker glenn kessler put it , such figures “ are a great example of false precision . we do not know exactly how many days trump has golfed , and we do not know how much has been paid by taxpayers for his golf outings .” that being said , kessler noted that germain ’ s estimates were “ in the ballpark ” of figures released by the government accountability office . still , he argues that “ one cannot fairly attribute all of these costs to golf , given the round - the - clock security required for a president .” <PARA> the bottom line is that multiple analyses have calculated figures that are in rough agreement with either germain ’ s or dáte ’ s claims that the cost is presently in the $ 109 million area , but numbers as precise as those stated in tweets mislead a reader into thinking a level of accuracy not reflective of reality has been achieved . the numbers vary , additionally , based on how one approaches the problem : do you include all the maintenance costs for air force one ? do you include security costs that would be present regardless of golf outings ? there is no one right answer , and as such there is no single number that can be verified as the number . <PARA> for these reasons , we rank the claim that “ trump spent “ 278 . 5 years ” of presidential salary on taxpayer - funded golf outings as a “ mixture .”
false	origins : according to this internet - circulated piece , to a man , marines decided they didn ’ t respect president clinton the minute he took office , and so for eight years all of them declined to observe proper protocol in his presence . moreover , no officer ever objected to this behavior , and not one member of the presidential entourage ever noticed or reported it . <PARA> the best way to answer this one would be to ask a marine . so we did : <PARA> if the question is “ did the marines who greeted the president willfully show disrespect by failing to execute a <PARA> “ facing ” movement after the salute ?” the answer is no . <PARA> proper protocol is for the marine to snap a salute to the president . the president may or may not return the salute at his discretion . if the president returns the salute , the marine immediately “ cuts ” or “ posts ” by bringing his arm sharply down to his side from the salute and remaining at a position of attention . if the president does not return the salute , the marine will wait until the president passes him , then he will cut and remain at a position of attention . this is the protocol when greeting a senior officer , including the president . <PARA> with the new presidency comes a changing of the presidential detail . the new command of the presidential detail may have chosen to add a facing movement to the protocol . this is at the complete discretion of the command . a marine does not have the luxury of choosing whether or not he follows proper protocol . he is given an order and he follows it to the letter . if the order does not include a facing movement , the facing movement will not occur . if the order includes a facing movent , the facing movement occurs . it is that simple . whether or not this movement becomes a standard part of protocol remains to be seen . <PARA> marines do not act as individuals , we act as a team . marines follow procedure and protocol . the marines you saw followed their orders . that is a marine . <PARA> “ facing ” movement after the salute ?” the answer is no . <PARA> proper protocol is for the marine to snap a salute to the president . the president may or may not return the salute at his discretion . if the president returns the salute , the marine immediately “ cuts ” or “ posts ” by bringing his arm sharply down to his side from the salute and remaining at a position of attention . if the president does not return the salute , the marine will wait until the president passes him , then he will cut and remain at a position of attention . this is the protocol when greeting a senior officer , including the president . <PARA> with the new presidency comes a changing of the presidential detail . the new command of the presidential detail may have chosen to add a facing movement to the protocol . this is at the complete discretion of the command . a marine does not have the luxury of choosing whether or not he follows proper protocol . he is given an order and he follows it to the letter . if the order does not include a facing movement , the facing movement will not occur . if the order includes a facing movent , the facing movement occurs . it is that simple . whether or not this movement becomes a standard part of protocol remains to be seen . <PARA> marines do not act as individuals , we act as a team . marines follow procedure and protocol . the marines you saw followed their orders . that is a marine . <PARA> this piece was also refuted in the st . louis post -

false	on 1 may 1971 , some 35 , 000 protesters camped out in west potomac park near the washington monument park in washington , d . c ., in preparation for a demonstration against the vietnam war . but the nixon administration canceled the protester ’ s permit , and over the next few days u . s . park police , washington metropolitan police , the d . c . national guard , and federal troops clashed with , and dispersed , many of the protesters . the civil disobedience activities that took place in d . c . that week have since become known as the “ 1971 may day protests .” <PARA> on 27 april 2018 , the “ history lovers club ” twitter account tweeted a photograph touted as “ one of the most beаutiful photos ever taken ,” an image supposedly showing a young couple passionately kissing during the may day protests , heedless of the violence occurring all around them : <PARA> however , this photograph dates from several decades after the 1971 may day protests and has nothing to do with that event . it ’ s actually an image created for a 2012 advertising campaign for ray - ban brand sunglasses , called “ the kiss ” and featuring the slogan “ never hide ”:
true	in early 2019 , an oklahoma lawmaker ’ s two - year - old comments about abortion re - emerged online and prompted skeptical inquiries from our readers . <PARA> on 15 february , the gaily grind web site posted an article with the headline “ gop lawmaker who called pregnant women ‘ hosts ’ pushing bill requiring men to approve all abortions ,” which reported that : <PARA> the gaily grind ’ s 2019 article created the impression that it was describing current events , but in reality humphrey had made his remarks two years earlier , in february 2017 , and they had generated a wave of outrage at the time . <PARA> humphrey did indeed say that he viewed a woman as a “ host ” for a fetus , although he stipulated that this view was limited to the context of pregnancy and abortion , stating that his more general view of female bodily autonomy was “ your body is your body .” <PARA> on 6 february 2017 , state representative justice humphrey , a republican who represents the 19th district in southeastern oklahoma , introduced house bill 1441 , which would have prohibited any abortion that took place without the written informed consent of the fetus ’ father , except in cases of rape or incest , or the father was deceased , or the woman ’ s life was in danger . <PARA> on 14 february 2017 , the state legislature ’ s public health committee voted in favor of the bill , but it never came before the general assembly and was never passed into law . <PARA> in the landmark 1992 case planned parenthood of southeastern pennsylvania vs . casey case , the u . s . supreme court ruled as unconstitutional a part of a pennsylvania state law requiring that a married woman provide her husband with advance notification that she intended to undergo an abortion . as a result , any law requiring a woman to obtain the consent of her sexual partner for an abortion would almost certainly have been overturned in court on the basis that it imposed an “ undue burden ” on a woman ’ s right of access to abortion , as set out in the 1973 u . s . supreme court decision in roe vs . wade . <PARA> in an interview with the intercept web site , published on 13 february 2017 , humphrey outlined the rationale behind his proposed legislation : <PARA> so humphrey did indeed say that once a woman has become pregnant , in his view she is a “ host ” for the fetus , and that her obligation to the fetus stems from that dynamic . however , he did also indicate that outside the context of pregnancy , his view of a woman ’ s bodily autonomy was “ hey , your body is your body and be responsible with it .” <PARA> this nuance was not fully acknowledged in some of the initial reporting on humphrey ’ s remarks , such as the february 2017 article on the web site of new york magazine ’ s “ the cut ,” whose headline read : “ oklahoma anti - abortion lawmaker says women are merely ‘ hosts ’,” or an opinion column on the web site bustle , which read : <PARA> it ’ s true that humphrey did say he viewed a woman as a “ host ” for a fetus once she has become pregnant , but he did not reduce the entire status of women in society to that of a host , even stipulating that beyond the context of pregnancy , “ your body is your body .” it is a matter of subjective opinion whether or not one accepts his distinction as being sincere or meaningful , but the fact remains that humphrey did express such a viewpoint .
true	all manner of sudden fatality are horrendous no matter where or when or how they occur , but we seem to assign decapitations to a special category populated by modes of death we find particularly disturbing . this form of expiration is especially gruesome because the mind is cut off from the body , ending a life , and it all takes place in a flash . a person who moments before was a living , thinking being is now just a headless trunk , spurting blood like a ghoulish prop in a bad horror film . though all forms of demise lead to the same place , this one is sickly fascinating thanks to its elevated gore quotient and the speed with which it drives home the finality of death . <PARA> we ’ d like to think beheadings happen only in campfire tales and low - budget thrillers , but they take place in real life too , as was the case in the death of dr . hitoshi nikaidoh . on 16 august 2003 , this 35 - year - old surgical resident was decapitated in a freakish elevator accident at christus st . joseph hospital in houston , texas . <PARA> the accident itself is hard to imagine : the ill - fated physician was trapped between the doors of the cable - propelled elevator , then decapitated as the carriage ascended . <PARA> according to the harris county medical examiner ’ s office , nikaidoh died from multiple blunt force injuries to the head and body . his corpse was retrieved from the bottom of the elevator shaft along with two pagers , a cell phone , and an electronic organizer police believed belonged to him . the upper portion of his head , which was severed just above the lower jaw , was found in the car of the elevator . his colleague , physician ’ s assistant karin steinau , who was in the car at the time , witnessed the whole thing . <PARA> ms . steinau told police the elevator had been out of service for a few days prior to the tragedy , but at the time of the accident the “ out of service ” sign had been removed . she had rung for the elevator ( with the intent of going to the sixth floor ) and had already stepped into it and pushed the button for her floor when nikaidoh tried to get into the car as the door was closing . as soon as she saw he was trapped by the doors , steinau tried to hit the emergency stop button but was unable to do so before the rising elevator had partially decapitated dr . nikaidoh . the elevator continued upwards , finally stopping between the fourth and fifth floors . steinau was trapped in the car along with nikaidoh ’ s cranial remains until she was rescued by firefighters . she was treated in the hospital ’ s emergency room for shock . <PARA> the cause of the deadly accident was a mystery . elevator doors should not shut when there is something between them , thanks to sensors mounted in the doors . also , a set of contacts in the door should keep the elevator from moving if the doors are not closed . yet both these things reportedly happened . a state investigative committee later reported that faulty wiring was to blame : <PARA> although elevator fatalities are not common , they do occur from time to time , and they are not always of the “ victim steps into an open elevator shaft ” ilk . on 21 july 2003 , 76 - year - old l . a . brown was killed at the kenner regional medical center in kenner , louisiana , when the gurney on which he was being transported to surgery in became trapped against the roof of an elevator when the car suddenly dropped several feet just as the gurney was being pulled out of it . on 7 may 1999 , 56 - year - old mary margaret nowosielski died in similar fashion at the st . joseph mercy hospital in michigan when the car her gurney was being rolled into suddenly went up , dragging her to the fourth floor and back down to the first floor between the car and the shaft wall . <PARA> even the elevator decapitation incident related here is not unique . on 6 january 1995 , a runaway elevator in a bronx office building decapitated 55 - year - old james chenault as he tried to help fellow passengers out of a malfunctioning car . the car had stopped slightly above the second floor and the doors opened . while chenault was holding the doors open with his back and helping a woman whose foot had become trapped , the car lurched suddenly upward , beheading him . the victim ’ s body fell to the bottom of the shaft , but the head remained in the car along with the remaining passengers as it shot up to the ninth floor .

mart spokesman bob mcadam said the company was considering offering such benefits but made no mention of when that might come about . <PARA> most of the claims made in the afa ’ s “ action alert ” stand up to scrutiny . the retailer did commit to giving $ 25 , 000 annually to the nglcc , and it agreed to sponsor two of that organization ’ s conferences . as to the nglcc being “ a leading promoter of homosexual marriage ,” a number of its press releases do show the group as being vocal in its opposition to the marriage protection act . however , the assertion that “ wal -

false	“ just when we thought the george zimmerman / trayvon martin case was over after zimmerman ’ s acquittal , the obama administration has taken the steps needed to file federal charges , thus sidestepping the well established double jeopardy , against zimmerman . unidentified sources within the administration have confirmed that obama , and justice eric holder at the department of justice , have filed charges against zimmerman for ‘ violating trayvon martin ’ s civil rights .'” <PARA> origins : in the wake of the “ not guilty ” verdict in the florida trial of george zimmerman for the february 2012 shooting death of trayvon martin , various groups have been calling for the department of justice to pursue federal civil rights charges against zimmerman : <PARA> angry civil rights groups [ are ] pressing for new criminal charges following george zimmerman ’ s acquittal on second -

degree murder charges in the case . the doj released a statement on the verdict , saying that although they might consider “ whether federal prosecution is appropriate ,” no determination or plans had yet been made to that effect : <PARA> experienced federal prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction , and whether federal prosecution is appropriate in accordance with the department ’ s policy governing successive federal prosecution following a state trial . <PARA> legal experts have also opined that civil rights charges in such a case are a rare occurrence and would be very difficult to prove : <PARA> to successfully prosecute zimmerman , the department of justice would have to show that zimmerman “ caused the death of trayvon martin solely motivated by / because of his race or color ,” [ former federal prosecutor david weinstein said ], adding : “ this element was absent from the state trial and quite frankly doesn ’ t exist .” <PARA> cnn legal analyst paul callan agreed that federal prosecutors are “ in sort of a tough spot .” the hate crimes statue is generally applied to cases involving police officers or other government agents , callan said , adding that using it in a case involving a lone private citizen is “ very , very rare and i think in this case , it ’ s going to be very hard to prove .” <PARA> a federal hate crimes violation in a killing carries a maximum penalty of life in prison . even if the federal charges were identical to the state charges , it would not be double jeopardy for zimmerman because the federal government is a separate and sovereign entity . <PARA> cnn legal analyst paul callan agreed that federal prosecutors are “ in sort of a tough spot .” the hate crimes statue is generally applied to cases involving police officers or other government agents , callan said , adding that using it in a case involving a lone private citizen is “ very , very rare and i think in this case , it ’ s going to be very hard to prove .” <PARA> a federal hate crimes violation in a killing carries a maximum penalty of life in prison . even if the federal charges were identical to the state charges , it would not be double jeopardy for zimmerman because the federal government is a separate and sovereign entity . <PARA> president obama ’ s public statement on zimmerman verdict simply called for “ calm reflection ” and noted that “ a jury has spoken ”; it did not call for or suggest further prosecution of george zimmerman : <PARA> i know this case has elicited strong passions . and in the wake of the verdict , i know those passions may be running even higher . but we are a nation of laws , and a jury has spoken . i now ask every american to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son . <PARA> white house press secretary jay carney also stated president obama would not be involved in the justice department ’ s review of possible civil rights charges against george zimmerman : <PARA> “ cases are brought on the merits ,” carney said . “ the merits are evaluated by the professionals at the department of justice .” <PARA> “ that ’ s not something the president involves himself in ,” he continued , adding that it would be “ inappropriate ” for the president to weigh in on a doj review . <PARA> “ that ’ s not something the president involves himself in ,” he continued , adding that it would be “ inappropriate ” for the president to weigh in on a doj review . <PARA> searches of federal court cases turned up no pending charges against george zimmerman .
mixture	on 15 march 2019 , as much of the internet reeled over the news that nearly 50 people had been killed during mass shootings at two mosques in new zealand , numerous social media users encountered an article reporting that a muslim student had set fire to a christian school in an effort to “ protest ” u . s . president donald trump : <PARA> while this article was shared on various facebook pages , twitter accounts , and reddit threads in the days before the new zealand massacre , those killings drew additional attention and comments to these posts . <PARA> the above - displayed article refers to a genuine incident from january 2018 . however , this article , which was originally published by “ newspunch ,” an outlet notorious for misleading reporting , gets a number of facts wrong . <PARA> for one , these fires were not set in “ protest ” of trump . a contemporary report from the star tribune reported that 19 - year - old tnuza jamal hassan set several fires at her former school “ in retaliation for u . s . military intervention in iraq and afghanistan .” <PARA> the report continued : “ tnuza j . hassan , of minneapolis , allegedly told police that “ she wanted the school to burn to the ground and that her intent was to hurt people ,” according to the complaint charging her with one count of felony first - degree arson filed in ramsey county district court . according to the charge , hassan said similar attacks happened on “ muslim land ” and no one cared if muslims were hurt . she told police and fire investigators , “ you guys are lucky that i don ’ t know how to build a bomb because i would have done that .” <PARA> neither the words “ protest ” nor “ trump ” appeared in any of the contemporary articles from credible news outlets that we examined . <PARA> newspunch also used a misleading ( and completely unrelated ) image of a fire to exaggerate the blaze ’ s impact . the photograph featured above does not show st . catherine ’ s university . this image actually shows an abandoned church that burned down in 2006 in quebec . we have not been able to locate photographs from the actual fires set by hassan , but cbs reported that the “ fires were small and quickly contained ,” that “ nobody was injured ,” and that the “ damage was limited to furnishings .” <PARA> in addition to newspunch ’ s misleading reporting , many people on social media made incorrect assumptions about this story after encountering it in march 2019 . for instance , several readers were upset that hassan only faced arson charges , rather than terrorism charges . in the months since hassan ’ s arrest in january 2018 , however , she was indicted on terrorism charges :
false	on 30 january 2016 , facebook user paul thomas published the above - reproduced photograph along with text reporting that four muslim men had demanded that a “ rural retail craft centre on a lancashire country estate ” provide them with a prayer room and provoked a near - riot that was averted only when their brusque demand was satisfied : <PARA> thomas likely wasn ’ t the author of the account or a first - hand witness to the event described , but his posting of it was one of the first of many iterations of this account ( all of which circulated with the same copied and pasted text , suggesting all the posters were shop owners recently bombarded by angry and devout muslim prayer room - seekers ). the earliest appearance of the report we were able to locate appeared on 30 january 2016 , but it lacked several specifics with respect to location , time , author , and verification of the image attached to the account described in the text . <PARA> a reader who asked about the claim after spotting it on facebook provided us with the location where the attached photograph was taken and information about the craft centre ’ s response : <PARA> the heskin farmers market & craft centre ’ s facebook page also fielded other inquiries from the public about the report and said the reports were “ incorrect ”: <PARA> when we contacted the heskin farmers market & craft centre via facebook ourselves , we initially received a brief reply from the page ’ s operator who asserted the claim was “ a complete false statement ” and pledged to us with provide additional information during business hours . <PARA> on 10 february 2015 , the business replied to our query via e - mail and directed us to a 1 february 2016 facebook post on their page addressing the rumor . in that post , heskin farmers market & craft center confirmed that the men in question had requested ( not demanded ) a space to pray , that the craft centre had accommodated their request out of a sense of goodwill ( while indicating that such accommodation was a one - time deal ), that no one involved was bothered , threatened , or otherwise harassed , and a few police incidentally arrived on the scene to help sort things out ( not to quell a near - riot ):
mixture	on 14 september 2016 , the college humor web site published a segment of popular trutv debunking show adam ruins everything about “ the conspiracy behind your glasses ,” describing how the luxottica conglomerate owns 80 percent of eyeglass brands , most optometry chains , and the second - largest vision care insurer in the united states : <PARA> without additional documentation it was difficult to authenticate the claim that luxottica controls “ 80 percent of glasses and sunglasses brands ,” as both cited forbes pieces were published by contributors and not the magazine itself . <PARA> variables such as the passage of time ( four years between the claim ’ s first uncited appearance in forbes and its reiteration in the september 2016 video ), ongoing increases in e - commerce , and the difficulty of establishing a baseline against which to compare luxottica ’ s market share versus those pf innumerable small competitors made verification problematic . <PARA> much of the interest in luxottica ’ s retail dominance came from a segment aired on the cbs 60 minutes news magazine program in 2012 , but that segment also did not provide a number for the proportion of eyeglass and sunglass brands that fall under luxottica ’ s umbrella ( compared to those of competitors such as walmart , costco , zenni optical , or warby parker ). <PARA> in may 2015 , business of fashion provided more recent figures for luxottica ’ s european sales performance , contrasted with those of the next - largest competitor , the safilo group : <PARA> rumblings of discontent about luxottica ’ s increasingly firm grip on the eyewear market were not new in 2016 . a 2013 yahoo ! finance article examined whether the brand ’ s stranglehold on optometry chains inhibited patients from obtaining complete prescriptions and taking their business elsewhere : <PARA> lynn brought interest into luxottica ’ s market dominance to the fore in his 2011 book cornered : the new monopoly capitalism and the economics of destruction : <PARA> in may 2011 , luxottica made headlines in california for controversial business practices criticized as a bid to expand control of the eyewear market : <PARA> a 2008 article in advocacy periodical consumers digest maintained a critical view of luxottica , describing several mergers and buyouts and a less - than - flattering assessment of the luxottica ’ s practices : <PARA> in 2015 , new york state senator chuck schumer proposed changes to the ftc ’ s eyeglass rule of 1992 , enacted to ensure that patients were not locked into purchasing overpriced glasses because of monopolies . in a 27 september 2015 press release , schumer ’ s office cited the “ 80 percent ” figure for luxoticca ’ s market share : <PARA> on 30 september 2015 , industry publication optometry times covered the same issue and suggested that senator schumer was “ misinformed ”: <PARA> luxottica provided a september 2015 statement to optometry times that reiterated the ( less than ) 20 percent market share figure cited by consumers digest : <PARA> luxottica themselves sent us the following statement : <PARA> regardless of the actual figure , much of adam ruins everything ‘ s assessment of luxottica ’ s market dominance was accurate , including the conglomerate ’ s ownership of several prominent optometry chains and the second - largest vision care insurer in the united states . <PARA> however , it is difficult to measure luxottica ’ s relative dominance against the innumerable independent optometry practices , large - scale retailers such as walmart and costco , and popular online retailers such zenni optical and warby parker . it is true that avoiding luxottica ’ s products can be difficult in mass retail environments , but patients with a complete eyeglass prescription are still able to obtain eyeglasses and sunglasses through other companies .
mixture	on 25 february 2017 , president donald trump tweeted to complain that the news media were not reporting his success in reducing the national debt during his first month in office : <PARA> as noted by news media from the los angeles times to the washington post , the tweet appeared closely after a “ fox & friends ” segment in which guest ( and former presidential candidate ) herman cain reported the same numbers . that story appeared to have its origins in a post on the conservative blog gateway pundit (“ amazing ! trump cuts us debt by $ 12 billion in his first month ”) which took credit for the trump tweet in an update to their story . <PARA> there are two claims implicit in the tweet . the first claim is simply the factual nature of the figures reported . the second is that the numbers represent an item worthy of coverage . <PARA> the numbers are factual in a literal sense , according to the online debt history search application offered by the us treasury department : <PARA> though the numbers regarding the debt at the end of trump ’ s and president obama ’ s first month are factual , their significance as a reportable bit of information or as an indicator of the impact or success of trump ’ s policies is questionable . speaking to cbs news , maya macguineas , director of the nonpartisan committee for a responsible budget , said : <PARA> indeed , in terms of newsworthiness ( or lack thereof ), sporadic reductions of the debt are not uncommon ( in red , below ) on a month - to - month basis , according to the “ monthly statement of the public debt of the united states ” reports released during the course of president obama ’ s second term in office : <PARA> in fact , the washington post ’ s wonkblog reports that , even on a day - to - day basis , fluctuations even greater than the one trump referenced are not unheard of : <PARA> secondly , there are few mechanisms by which any actions trump has taken as president would affect the national debt thus far , as he has not signed into law any financial measures related to federal borrowing . while there are arguments to be made that other factors related to trump ’ s presidency could affect the debt , the post has said it is unlikely , and also impossible to quantify : <PARA> keith hennessey , a former director of the u . s . national economic council appointed by george w . bush , wrote a “ hypothetical memo ” to congress analyzing the 45th president ’ s tweet . in this document , he stated that neither obama nor trump had any effect on the national debt in their first month in office : <PARA> hennessey added that it is equally unfair to compare the 2009 economic situation with the 2017 one : <PARA> more to the point , however , the fact that the day - to - day and month - to - month fluctuations of the national debt are so volatile , he argued , is why analysts don ’ t typically look at the data for these time periods , accordingo to hennessey : <PARA> it should also be noted that , as the fox and friends segment aired on one of the nation ’ s most popular national cable news networks , “ the media ” did indeed report on this story . the reason it didn ’ t pick up much steam is that the numbers were not newsworthy because they were taken out of context and are likely irrelevant to president trump ’ s actions in office .
false	the internet is full of fictional dangers . human - eating drop bears , blood - freezing snow snakes and , according to a video that went viral in november 2017 , random flaming rocket tires . <PARA> this fiery clip we feature in our video has been digitally manipulated . it was created by adding flames to footage that has been circulating since at least june 2015 . the original video showed a runaway truck tire , sans flames , barreling down between a person and a car , crashing into an off - camera object , then smashing back down on top of the hood of the car : <PARA> this video certainly doesn ’ t show a real flaming tire crashing dangerously close to two people . we cannot say for certain that the original footage is totally authentic , as we haven ’ t been able to uncover any information about the incident . <PARA> the earliest iteration of this video that we could find , a sped - up version posted to youtube by viral hog on 1 june 2015 , claimed that the woman in the car suffered a broken wrist . however , the post did not provide any sources for that information .
false	most fans of the winnie the pooh books , movies , or television series are likely aware that the titular character is often referred to as “ he ” or a “ him .” but in june 2018 , many readers were shocked to come across a childhood - shattering rumor that winnie the pooh had actually been a girl bear all along : <PARA> this rumor largely came from a 2015 book called finding winnie : the true story of the world ’ s most famous bear about the real - life inspiration for the character , a beloved ( female ) bear named winnipeg who lived at the london zoo . at the time , many outlets reported on the revelation made in this book with misleading titles such as “ new children ’ s book reveals winnie the pooh is a girl .” as the bbc explained : <PARA> there ’ s plenty of evidence that a . a . milne wrote the winnie the pooh character as a boy bear . for one thing , the character is referred to as “ he ” throughout milne ’ s stories . furthermore , the real stuffed animal with which the real christopher robin played ( who was also a . a . milne ’ s son ) was originally named “ edward ”: <PARA> a . a . milne even introduced the character as “ edward bear ” in the book winnie the pooh before noting that he was known to his friends as winnie - the - pooh (“ or pooh for short ”): <PARA> another passage explains how he received the name winnie . when christopher robin is asked why he gave the bear the name winnie if it was a boy , he retorts that that he named the bear “ winnie - ther - pooh ,” not winnie ( or even winnie - the - pooh ):
true	when the results began coming in from the 30 march 2005 powerball drawing , lottery officials suspected fraud was underway . although only one winner qualified for the $ 13 . 8 million jackpot , a record 110 players were claiming second prizes of either $ 100 , 000 or $ 500 , 000 ( depending on whether they ’ d paid an extra dollar for the power play option that multiplies a win ) for having matched the first five of the six numbers drawn . normally the lottery , which is held across 29 states , pays out only about four or five second - place prizes . <PARA> having 110 claimants of second - place money appeared highly suspect . yet it turned out no chicanery had been afoot : the unexpected result had been just the way the cookie crumbled . <PARA> the roughly one - in - three - million combination of 22 , 28 , 32 , 33 , and 39 had been selected by so many hopeful lotto players because it had been the set of “ lucky numbers ” given to them in their fortune cookies . ( the cookies missed on having all six winning numbers by a mere matter of recommending 40 rather than 42 as the red powerball number .) <PARA> the sagacious confections had been manufactured at wonton food inc . of long island city in queens , new york . that factory produces four million fortune cookies a day vended under a variety of brands , which is how the cookies came to influence lottery players in so many states . <PARA> stunned lottery officials heard time and again from the second - place winners that they ’ d gotten their numbers from cookies . additional confirmation of the claim came from the lottery tickets themselves : nearly all of them listed “ 40 ” as the powerball number , and 40 had been the final of the six numbers given on the fortune cookie slips . <PARA> while not everyone plays numbers that are suggested to them by external sources , a great many do . a march 2005 episode of television ’ s lost included a sequence of lottery numbers , and hundreds of viewers subsequently played that combination . it didn ’ t win , though . <PARA> while fortune hunting via fortune cookie might now seem a prime idea , it needs be kept in mind that the lone winning combination that grabbed the $ 13 . 8 million powerball jackpot on 31 march 2005 came not from an after - dinner amusement at a chinese restaurant , but rather from a computer : it had been a computer - generated quick pick .
false	in october 2015 a warning about garlic imported from china ( and how consumers might easily spot it ) was posted to facebook , and the blog of social media pseudoscience guru david “ avocado ” wolfe published a related article titled “ red alert : this is how you spot harmful bleach and chemical laden garlic from china ”: <PARA> both missives claimed ( as illustrated by the photographs shown above ) that all garlic grown in china lacked roots and a stem , and all american - grown garlic retained that material . according to the facebook post , the “ ag dept .” mandates the removal of roots in order to inhibit the spread of agricultural pathogens from china , while wolfe ’ s blog posited that the roots were removed for an entirely separate reason ( i . e ., shipping costs ): “ if it has roots and a stem , it is safe . china will cut these off before they ship them to save weight .” <PARA> the notion that garlic ’ s country of origin can be determined solely by the presence of lack of root material wasn ’ t new in october 2015 , as a july 2012 blog post cited a consumer affairs representative at garlic company christopher ranch as a source of the former claim : <PARA> a 2009 blog post from christopher ranch claimed chinese garlic “ typically ” lacked a root . however , the assertions conflicted visually with christopher ranch marketing materials ( in which rootless bulbs of garlic were displayed ): <PARA> furthermore ( as many facebook commenters pointed out ), garlic seen at farm stands and in local csa ( community supported agriculture ) boxes often lacks a root despite the plant ’ s origins . nothing prevents any garlic grower in the united states from removing the root from their garlic , and many do ( as evidenced by many photographs from random american farmers ’ markets ). <PARA> according to a 2009 usda report [ pdf ], about 50 percent of garlic sold in the u . s . is grown in china . however , the bulk of imported garlic ( irrespective of origin outside north and central america ) is subject to the same regulatory guidelines ( primarily concerning the exclusion of above - ground materials and allowing only for a dry bulb [ pdf ]. <PARA> wolfe ’ s article also warned readers that garlic from china was sprayed with “ highly toxic poisons ,” followed by a photograph of a chinese farmer ostensibly dousing garlic in poisonous pesticides : <PARA> however , that image was a stock photograph of pesticide spraying “ at the rice field in dawu village of hechi city .” <PARA> some american - grown garlic lacks root material for a number of reasons , and an absence of that feature isn ’ t proof positive garlic was specifically grown in china . garlic origin can ’ t be definitively via the presence of a root , and those who wish to consume only u . s .- grown garlic would do better to go by brand name ( or purchase garlic from a local farmer ’ s market or csa outlet ).
unproven	examples : <PARA> legend has it that during a biology class / lab . the students in one class ( our university ) wear asked to take swabs of one partner ’ s mouth and identify the types of cells ( i . e . skin cells , blood , bacteria etc ). one male / female team was having some trouble identifying a cell that they found in the girl ’ s mouth . after looking through all their notes , they gave up and called the lab assistant over . he looked in the microscope and anounced that it was a sperm cell . <PARA> the incident goes that this one gorgeous woman in the class ( blonde , sexy , the works ) found something curious and kept inviting people , including the prof ., to come have a look at it since she had no clue what it was . so everybody basically peeked at it and walked away chuckling and she kept getting even more excited — begging all and sundry to tell her what it was — till , of course , the professor told her it was a sperm cell !! <PARA> a teacher friend heard this story at lunch : <PARA> it seems that a science teacher was explaining the wonders of the microscopic world to his avid young students . while saying “ everything has microscopic germs , life , and thingies on it ,” he decided to demonstrate by having a student scrape her teeth with a toothpick , wipe it on a slide and put it up on the overhead . lo ! but what appears but our strong swimmer friend , the sperm . <PARA> variations : <PARA> origins : this <PARA> legend dates to the days when male and female students were housed in separate residence halls , contact between the two was carefully monitored by colleges , and premarital sex was frowned upon . the legend combines sexist elements — particularly the unsuitability of women for academic pursuits ( especially in such traditionally male fields as science ) — with an embarrassment tale in which a female student ’ s scandalous sexual activities are revealed . as colleges liberalized and switched to coed dormitories and sexual relations between college students became more prevalent , the setting of this legend shifted to high school biology classes , where the story could regain some of its shock value among younger subjects . <PARA> in some more recent versions of this legend the embarrassed student is a male , indicating its shift away from a salacious tale about the sexuality of female students to one ( perhaps with homophobic overtones ) in which homosexuals are accidentally “ outed .” this legend is very similar in structure and theme to another embarrassment legend , salt of the mirth .

true	a photograph showing a man standing on top of a large pile of bison skulls has been circulating around the internet for several years . the above - displayed version was shared to the “ transcend politics , embrace humanity ” facebook page on 31 january 2016 , along with a quote from american biologist victor scheffer : <PARA> the above - displayed photo and quote are both real . the image , which was archived in the burton historical collection at the detroit public library , was taken in 1892 in rougeville , michigan : <PARA> while the burton historical collection does not specifically state what the bison bones in the above - displayed photo were used for , it ’ s likely that they were ground down into fertilizer . the us fish & wildlife service says that bison bones were used in “ refining sugar , and in making fertilizer and fine bone china ”: <PARA> the quote accompanying the photo is also real , although it wasn ’ t originally attached to the photo of bison skulls ; it originally appeared in the 1983 book spires of form : glimpses of evolution by american biologist victor scheffer . <PARA> national geographic ’ s page on the american bison states that nearly 50 million bisons were killed by settlers in the 19th century :
false	just when we thought we ’ d had our fill of debate - related conspiracies , a new one came along , this one in the form of a video purportedly documenting that democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton and moderator lester holt had colluded to rig the first presidential debate through a system of secret hand signals : <PARA> when the alt - right web site true pundit shared the video , they did so along with the additional claim that clinton had never made similar gestures in previous debates , campaign appearances , or speeches : <PARA> the above - displayed video does not provide any evidence that hillary clinton and lester holt communicated via hand signals so that clinton could indicate to holt when she wanted him to call on her so she could get in a “ zinger .” the creator of the video simply strung together several unrelated events — clinton scratching her face , holt making a comment , clinton replying to trump — and then claimed that they were somehow connected to a furtive signaling plot without providing any proof . <PARA> but before we dig deeper into the video , let ’ s look at the accompanying claims about it from true pundit and infowars . <PARA> hillary clinton has been in the public eye for decades . she was the first lady of arkansas in 1983 , the first lady of the united states in 1993 , a u . s . senator in 2001 , a presidential candidate in 2008 , secretary of state in 2009 , and and a presidential candidate again in 2016 . it is simply ridiculous to claim that clinton never once touched her face during a speech , campaign rally , or debate : <PARA> it should be noted that hillary clinton was not the only one making these gestures during the first presidential debate : <PARA> it should also be noted that ( as shown in the image at the head of this page ) the two candidates were physically separated on the stage , and therefore in order to catch the supposed “ signals ” from hillary clinton , moderator lester holt — who didn ’ t have the advantage of the split - screen shot presented to television viewers — would had to have been rather obviously watching her even when she was not speaking . <PARA> if donald trump truly “ dominated the early part of the debate ” but then lost his advantage , the more logical explanation is that his opponent ’ s strategy to throw him off his game simply worked as expected : <PARA> this conspiracy theory also doesn ’ t account for the much more obvious approach that if hillary clinton really wanted to say something during the course of the debate when it wasn ’ t her turn to speak , she could simply have interrupted her opponent rather than invoking secret hand signals and waiting to be called upon by the moderator — as she did in fact do multiple times ... while donald trump also did so , but three times as often .
false	in the waning hours of 2017 , business insider published a terrifying headline for sweets lovers : “ chocolate is on track to go extinct in 40 years .” <PARA> that claim was repeated uncritically around the internet as the story gained viral strength , capping a year of difficult news . <PARA> contrary to its click - ready headline , however , the primary focus of article concerned a joint effort by scientists with the uc berkeley innovative genomics institute and the mars candy company to create a genetically modified form of cacao ( the plant used in chocolate production ) resistant to the future effects of climate change and habitat loss . <PARA> the motivation for such an effort , which remains largely theoretical , rests on sound ( but not new ) research highlighting the likely negative effects of climate change on the world ’ s major cocoa producing countries . as an introduction to their article , the first item on business insider ’ s three point summary stated “ cacao plants are slated to disappear by as early as 2050 thanks to warmer temperatures and dryer weather conditions .” <PARA> that sentence , which was the primary reason for the story ’ s viral success , was a wholly inaccurate representation of both the article it topped and the research concerning climate change and cocoa production it purported to rest on . the body of the actual story presented a slightly less apocalyptic description of the situation : <PARA> that information came from the 2014 intergovernmental panel on climate change ( ipcc ) impacts , adaptation , and vulnerability report , which concluded ( table 9 - 5 , pg . 627 ) that under a “ business as usual ” scenario of future carbon emissions , ghana and côte d ’ ivoire would experience a 2 . 1oc increase in temperature and no change in rainfall , resulting in a “ considerable reduction in [ suitable growing ] area ” for cocoa production in ghana and an “ almost total elimination [ of suitable growing area ] in ivory coast .” <PARA> biological extinction , as implied by the headline this information was packaged under , refers to the complete and total removal of a species from the planet — a far cry from a “ considerable reduction in area ” reported by the ipcc . <PARA> ingrid parker , a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at uc santa cruz , told us that while climate change may make it harder to grow cocoa in côte d ’ ivoire and ghana , other countries are capable of growing the crop as well : “ cacao [ cocoa ] is grown in other places , like australia , and it ’ s not even native to africa ( it comes from the new world ).” <PARA> while climate change presents a credible threat to future cocoa production and to the economies of the countries that grow it , that story was lost in an effort to lure worried chocolate lovers to click on a link . the question is not whether or not chocolate will be around in 2058 ( it will be around ), the question is how much will it cost future generations to buy it and whether genetic modification can play a role in its future production .
false	urban legendry comprises many different tales of swindlers who have managed to take in large amounts of money not through violence , intimidation or overt theft , but by impersonating figures authorized to collect funds from the public . by falsely posing as washroom attendants , sales clerks , toll collectors , bank guards , or the like , these criminals need not resort to the use of guns or threats to acquire their booty ; they simply take in cash innocently handed to them by unsuspecting patrons who believe they are engaging in ordinary , authorized transactions . by the time anyone realizes something ’ s amiss ( because , for example , a particular establishment starts hearing about its “ washroom attendant ” from customers even though it has never hired anyone for such a position ), the scammers are long gone . <PARA> one tale of larcenous ingenuity is a remarkable example of this genre in that it posits a crafty crook didn ’ t simply pull off a phony “ parking lot attendant ” ruse for a short while and then abscond with a few hundred pounds in ill - gotten gains , but that he kept up the deception for over twenty years and took in hundreds of thousands ( if not millions ) of pounds before “ retiring ” to live a life of luxury . according to legend , he was able to achieve such amazing longevity at his unauthorized profession because he plied his trade in a parking lot used by zoo visitors , and both the zoo and the local city council each thought the other was responsible for the operation of ( and thus the collection of funds from ) the carpark : <PARA> the locale now mentioned most frequently in circulating versions of this legend is bristol zoo gardens , a 12 - acre site in clifton . this united kingdom zoo is the fifth oldest in the world and a long - established major tourist attraction in bristol . bristol zoo visitors utilize one of three car parks : one on college road , one on clifton down , and an overflow lot on the downs during the high season . usage charges for these lots are : <PARA> in reference to the bristol zoo , at least , this tale is purely the stuff of fiction rather than fact . the bristol zoo says it has never experienced any confusion over parking attendants , and that it has several attendants and more than one car park , none open to coaches . moreover , in response to our inquiry about the tale , a bristol zoo representative told us : <PARA> this story originated with a feature on urban myths published in the bristol evening post back in 2007 to coincide with april fool ’ s day , not as a reporting of a real - life event . after an american writer spun the legend out into a full - length book in 2010 , this is bristol reported : <PARA> people have run parking scams in which they ’ ve directed motorists to leave their cars on lots they neither owned nor had the authority to grant temporary permission for their use , but none got away for it very long , let alone “ for 25 years ” as the e - mailed tale would have it . in december 2009 , a brooklyn man broke into a closed city - owned garage , opened it , and began charging people for parking . he was chased off the site the next day by police , who subsequently tracked him via the dna he left on a soda can and arrested him on charges of burglary and criminal impersonation . <PARA> similarly , in may 2008 a maintenance worker with the birmingham [ alabama ] parking authority collected fees from motorists attending a nearby charity event then directed them to leave their cars on a private lot . many of those vehicles were subsequently towed and their drivers charged $ 200 to retrieve their cars .

true	throughout the years the especially sharp - eyed have noticed the presence of cryptic name - and - number notations on burger wrappings and disposable cups used at in - n - out burger , a popular chain of hamburger eateries in california , nevada , arizona , texas , oregon , and utah . these tiny notations are placed in out - of - the - way spots ( the undersides of cups and near the seams of the paper pouches burgers are placed in ). no overt explanation is given for the presence of the odd phrases or their meaning : they just quietly sit there , awaiting decipherment by those moved to do so . <PARA> these mysterious markings are pointers to biblical passages . those easily disturbed by the presence of bible verses need not fear for their souls , however : the text of the passages themselves are not spelled out on the cups and wrappings ; only their notations appear there . <PARA> in - n - out burger was founded by harry and esther snyder in baldwin park , california , in 1948 . although this chain of west coast hamburger restaurants has since grown to more than 200 outlets , control still rests in the hands of the snyder family . according to the company ’ s web site : “ in - n - out remains privately owned and the snyder family has no plans to take the company public or franchise any units .” the snyders are a religious family , and their continuing to control their own company means they can put what they want on their product packaging . they ’ ve chosen to include pointers to particular bible verses that we presume hold special meaning for them . <PARA> the soda cup bears the notation john 3 : 16 : “ for god so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have everlasting life .” <PARA> the milkshake cup lists proverbs 3 : 5 : “ trust in the lord with all thine heart ; and lean not unto thine own understanding .” <PARA> the water cup ( no longer available to customers but we ’ re told is still used by employees ) bears john 14 : 6 : “ jesus saith unto him , i am the way , the truth , and the life : no man cometh unto the father , but by me .” <PARA> the hamburger and cheeseburger wrappers point to revelation 3 : 20 : “ behold , i stand at the door , and knock : if any man hear my voice , and open the door , i will come in to him , and will sup with him , and he with me .” <PARA> the wrap used for the “ double - double ” ( two burger patties and two slices of cheese ) lists nahum 1 : 7 : “ the lord is good , a strong hold in the day of trouble ; and he knoweth them that trust in him .” <PARA> the french fry holder lists proverbs 24 : 16 : “ for though a righteous man falls seven times , he rises again , but the wicked are brought down by calamity .” <PARA> we examined the packaging of other menu offerings from in - n - out ( coffee cups , milk containers ) but failed to uncover any further pointers to bible verses . the ones we ’ ve found expound upon a shared theme : belief in the lord . <PARA> as proselytizing goes , this is about as low - key as it gets . <PARA> not even the texts of the verses themselves are printed out ; those looking to absorb the messages ( and who don ’ t have this article handy ) have to do so with the assistance of their own bibles . yet even so , the presence of those simple notations has been interpreted by some as indicative of a lurking menace : we ’ ve had folks tell us they ’ ve heard in - n - out burger was “ owned by the religious right ” or “ the christian coalition ,” or a “ sect ,” or that bible - study classes were secretly held at each location . <PARA> likewise , the search for a good backstory to enliven whatever appears even slightly mysterious has given birth to a rumor that the presence of the bible verses is in some way connected to the 1993 death of son richard snyder ( 41 ) in a plane crash . though even in - n - out burger can ’ t provide a precise date of when the bible citations were first placed on its packaging , company records indicate they ’ ve been there at least since 1987 , which rules out the “ deceased son ” theory .

unproven	some family traditions are inexplicable ... as one bride supposedly found out when she finally thought to question why cutting off the ends of the roast before cooking the meat made for a better result : <PARA> setting up housekeeping is a daunting yet satisfying task as the bride strives to create a home for herself and her husband , not just a bare - walls place to live . ( grooms appear to be far less motivated in this regard — if it has a tv , sofa , and refrigerator , they figure it ’ s about as done as it gets .) in creating her nest , it ’ s assumed the bride will make mistakes early on as she finds out the hard way that what looked so easy when mom was doing it is a bit more difficult on one ’ s own . burnt dinners and tears go together , but eventually a satisfactory homelife is settled into as major purchases are made , redecoration is accomplished , and traditions established within this new family . throughout the upheaval , the bride is expected to look to her mother for a living example of how to pull it all together and to rely on her advice . <PARA> it ’ s upon this assumption this legend rests . many of the secrets of being a good cook are counterintuitive , and it ’ s easy to adopt an “ i don ’ t know how this works , i just know it does ” stance as yet another of mom ’ s recipes proves to turn out only when certain procedures are rigidly followed . the stage is set , so to speak , for the “ too big for the pan ” joke . <PARA> often told within the jewish religion , this tale is a parable for teaching the importance of understanding the whys of religious rituals . it is not enough , says this legend , to perform by rote — if observance is to have value , the reasons behind a tradition have to be appreciated as well as the ritual itself faithfully carried out . what better way to express this concept than by telling a tale of a bride and a trimmed roast ? <PARA> in 2001 , the following version of this classic appeared in the canadian edition of reader ’ s digest : <PARA> this account came to us from a reader in 2005 : <PARA> in 2003 a reader mailed us an especially enjoyable version of the tale : <PARA> just to prove it ’ s not only the ladies who fall into the trap of imitating without understanding , we leave you with this bit of humor from 1958 : <PARA> variations : <PARA> sightings : this legend surfaces in a 1994 episode of television ’ s the commish : tony scali asks one of his officers why he makes five copies of each document only to always throw away the fifth and is told “ that ’ s the way we ’ ve always done it .” in retaliation , the commish tells the “ ends cut off the roast ” story .

unproven	in july 2019 , u . s . president donald trump prompted an outraged response , primarily from those within the democratic party but also from some of his fellow republicans , when he targeted “ progressive democrat congresswomen ” of recent immigrant heritage , suggesting they should “ go back and help fix the totally broken and crime - infested places from which they came , then come back and show us how it is done .” <PARA> it was widely understood that trump ’ s tweets were a reference to a group of four members of congress — u . s . reps . alexandria ocasio - cortez ( new york ), ilhan omar ( minnesota ), rashida tlaib ( michigan ) and ayanna pressley ( massachussetts .) the fact that all four women are u . s . citizens and only one ( omar ) was born outside the country prompted widespread criticism of trump ’ s remarks as racist and xenophobic . <PARA> on july 15 , cnn presenter jake tapper suggested a measure of hypocrisy or short -

be naturalized citizen must first live in the u . s . as a permanent resident for five years , 2000 would be the earliest year in which omar ’ s father ( and omar herself ) could become citizens . since omar was born in october 1982 , she turned 18 in october 2000 . so , based on the sequence of events presented by omar , it appears she became a u . s . citizen at the age of 17 , some time between january and october 2000 — roughly six years before melania trump , by her own account , became a u . s . citizen . <PARA> although omar ’ s account makes sense , and we found no substantive dispute over it , we were unable to locate any official documentation that supports that version of events . we asked omar ’ s spokesperson and district director to provide any official documentation that would confirm the date of her naturalization , but we received no such evidence . <PARA> the congresswoman ’ s spokesperson reiterated that she became a u . s . citizen in 2000 , and pointed out that an individual cannot be elected to the u . s . house of representatives without demonstrating citizenship , but the spokesperson did not have omar ’ s “ personal government documents .” <PARA> until and unless evidence of that nature becomes available to us , definitively establishing that omar became a u . s . citizen in 2000 and trump in 2006 , the claim of this fact - check remains unproven , though likely to be true .

false	fact check is sam ’ s club offering free memberships to new ( and soon - to - be ) moms ? <PARA> outdated <PARA> origins : on 21 september 2015 , social media coupon groups and mommy blogs were awash in a tsunami of posts promising free memberships in sam ’ s club ( a chain of membership - only retail warehouse clubs owned and operated by walmart ) to new moms . the catch ? a whole bunch , as it turns out . <PARA> the scope of the free membership for new moms at sam ’ s club offer was persistently murky . no official announcement post appeared on either the retailer ’ s facebook or twitter pages ( although legions of angry messages did ). while responses on both social media sites acknowledged that the chain had extended an offer of some related description at some point , information about eligibility for the offer was nowhere to be found on their official social media pages ( and at least one circulated link led to an error page ). social media users who phoned sam ’ s club overwhelmingly reported waiting hours , getting busy signals , and being disconnected after long waits : <PARA> some users reported success through calling sam ’ s club ( but often only after being placed on hold for long periods ). others stated that the offer was never meant to be open to everyone : many mentioned a “ mailer ” sent to selected candidates that had purportedly been shared on social media ( causing the confusion and long caller wait times ): <PARA> a good deal of the confusion apparently stemmed from the fact that sam ’ s club initially had information about the program posted on their web site , but the company inexplicably removed the link well before the enrollment deadline : <PARA> reports also circulated claiming that people encouraged fellow users to request the sam ’ s club membership offer despite their not meeting its “ new mom ” criteria : <PARA> in a tweet sam ’ s club advised interested parties to call about the free membership offer , but provided no useful information to users who might not have hours to spare on the phone only to learn they aren ’ t eligible : <PARA> in short , it appeared sam ’ s club indeed initiated some type of promotion involving free memberships for new moms in august 2015 . whether that offer was extended to a small group or to all new moms remains unclear , as sam ’ s club has done little to address the confusion on facebook and twitter . no comprehensive direction has been issued by the company about the popular discount , and interested sam ’ s club customers have been advised to call a phone number ( at which they may or may not be subjected to holds lasting several hours ). <PARA> a number of readers have reported to us that , whatever the origins of the program ( and regardless of whether it was intended to be offered to the public at large ), it is available to pregnant women and mothers with children under the age of one , and they were successful in signing up for it . some of them suggested that contacting sam ’ s club about it via e - mail was an effective method for avoiding sitting on the telephone through interminable wait times . <PARA> first published : 22 september 2015

false	in september 2008 , democratic presidential nominee barack obama was interviewed by george stephanopoulos for abc ’ s this week news program . when the subject of the interview turned to senator obama ’ s assertion that republicans were attempting to scare voters by suggesting he is not christian , the following exchange occurred : <PARA> this interview was widely circulated online ( typically in excerpted form ) as purported evidence of obama ’ s supposedly “ admitting ” he was a muslim : <PARA> obama ’ s remark that “ you ’ re absolutely right that john mccain has not talked about my muslim faith ...” was a straightforward statement : he was not “ proclaiming ” his “ muslim faith ”; rather , he was acknowledging that republican nominee john mccain had not specifically promulgated the false rumor that he ( obama ) was a muslim . <PARA> unfortunately , at that point of the interview , george stephanopoulos — apparently not understanding the context of obama ’ s response — mistakenly attempted to correct him by interjecting the words “ your christian faith .” this non sequitur briefly threw obama off track , and he responded by repeating the words “ my christian faith ” and then returned to the point he was trying to make : <PARA> a very brief , out - of - context segment was then clipped from that exchange and sent winging around the internet as proof that senator obama had “ admitted his muslim faith ,” something even the right - leaning washington times acknowledged was false :

unproven	on 3 july 2018 , u . s . president donald trump repeated via twitter a story that had been offered by fox news one day earlier , holding that the administration of trump ’ s predecessor barack obama had granted u . s . citizenship to 2 , 500 iranians during nuclear deal negotiations in 2015 : <PARA> the obama administration negotiated the joint comprehensive plan of action ( jcpoa ), a deal struck with iran that lifted key sanctions against that country in exchange for iran ’ s allowing independent monitoring to ensure they were winding down their nuclear program . that plan was signed off on by all members of the united nations security council , but in may 2018 president trump abruptly backed the u . s . out of the agreement : <PARA> the claim echoed by trump in his tweet about “ 2 , 500 iranians ” was initially made by iranian politician hojjat al - islam mojtaba zolnour and was quoted by fars , a persian - language news outlet with questionable reliability which is often described as a quasi - mouthpiece for the iranian government . fox news repeated that quote in their version of the report : <PARA> it ’ s unclear where zolnour , who is a critic of iranian president hassan rouhani and is considered a conservative hardliner , came up with the 2 , 500 figure ( nor did the fox news story provide any additional information on that front ). the fox article also referenced the names of two relatives of iranian officials who now live in the united states ( ali fereydoun and fatemeh ardeshir larijanibut ) but also noted that “ there is no suggestion either of these people received citizenship in the wake of the iranian nuclear deal .” <PARA> according to department of homeland security data , 10 , 344 iranian - born persons became naturalized citizens of the u . s . in 2015 , while 13 , 114 others gained legal permanent residency . those numbers don ’ t deviate drastically from preceding years ’ figures or from those of 2016 , the most recent data available . <PARA> jeffrey prescott , a senior director on president obama ’ s national security council , responded to the claim with a tweet labeling president trump ’ s statement as “ absurd and false ”: <PARA> the comment made by zolnour likely reflects a political reality in iran , said alireza nader , a washington , d . c .- based specialist on the country . amidst popular uprisings against a regime that many citizens consider corrupt , a number of high - ranking iranian officials have sent their children or relatives to live in the united states . this situation has fostered resentment among iranians who question why a privileged class are free to travel and live in the u . s . while president trump ’ s travel ban has rendered doing so impossible for most ordinary citizens . <PARA> nader told us that “ i don ’ t know if there was a specific policy to let [ iranian officials ’ families ] settle [ in the u . s .]. but there is definitely a sense of anger in iran that the regime basically represses iranians and says ‘ death to america ,’ yet sends its children to study in the u . s . and live good lives while iranians are suffering .” <PARA> zolnour ’ s comment , nader added , was likely a “ clumsy ” dig at rouhani . as washington post journalist jason rezaian noted , both trump and zoulnor probably intended it as a slight against their domestic adversaries and not a genuine revelation of truth about an international agreement they consider disagreeable : <PARA> a cbs news report on this issue similarly concluded by stating that :

false	on 2 august 2017 , the blog american news posted a story reporting that a new jersey town had prohibited residents from criticizing muslims or islam , in keeping with sharia law ( a code of behavior conduct practiced by observant muslims ), citing a story posted by the conspiratorial blog world net daily ( wnd ). <PARA> both stories misleadingly feature 2009 photographs from a demonstration against a dutch politician in london , which is completely unrelated to the events in new jersey . the american news story reports : <PARA> the settlements came in may 2017 after the islamic society of basking ridge and the department of justice sued the township for violating the religious land use and institutionalized persons act of 2000 , a law that requires all religious persons and institutions to be treated equally when seeking building permits for places of worship . <PARA> both american news and wnd are referring to a portion of the settlement between isbr and the local government of bernards township in new jersey , which agreed to pay $ 3 . 25 million and allow isbr to build a mosque on property they already own after four years of public hearings . ( the justice department also settled separately with the town .) <PARA> the agreement outlines a single planning commission meeting in which isbr ’ s final site plan approval will be discussed and voted upon . per the settlement , the meeting discussion will be tightly limited to items on the agenda . the meeting will not adjourn until it is complete , and cannot be extended beyond one session , “ even if the hearing must continue beyond 12 : 00 midnight and into the next day .” at this hearing , witness testimony is also tightly curtailed , and one of the rules is : <PARA> in response to the limitation on discussion of islam or muslim people , thomas more law center — a conservative activist law firm — has filed a lawsuit on behalf of two residents who live near the proposed mosque site , christopher and loretta quick , claiming that the limitation on discussion of islam and muslims during the planning meeting is a violation of their “ right to engage in constitutionally protected speech at an upcoming public hearing .” it is on their lawsuit that these stories are based , but they are crafted to lead readers to believe that all city residents are prohibited from any criticism of islam or its followers . this is untrue . <PARA> we were unable to reach a bernards township city official for an explanation as to why the rule was put in place to begin with , but it is generally legally accepted that local governments can reasonably limit public comments at public meetings in the interest of efficiency — although this is periodically the subject of lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of such limitations . what a court will determine about the limitation in this instance is yet to be decided . <PARA> the settlements bring to a close years of hostility surrounding the project ’ s approval process . isbr officially sought government approval for the mosque in 2012 . in intervening years between 2012 and the commission denying their request in 2016 , they were subjected to anti - muslim sentiment both at and outside public meetings in which people accused them of everything from supporting terrorism to animal sacrifice , according to court documents . <PARA> members of the public have been instructed not to discuss islam or muslims during one public meeting prescribed by a legal settlement in which city officials have limited time to consider and approve a project that has a track record of being dragged out for years and also inspiring heated emotions . however there is no over - arching law in bernards township “ forbidding ” citizens from criticizing islam or its followers outside of that one extremely limited setting . <PARA> further , contrary to the claim made by both publications that sharia bans criticism of islam , omar suleiman , islamic studies professor at southern methodist university and president of the yaqeen institute for islamic research told us that if someone berates islam , verses 6 : 68 and 4 : 140 in the koran urge muslims to “ simply ignore it ” and walk away until the subject changes . suleiman also noted that muslims have historically debated their christian counterparts and members of other faiths about religion in public settings .
true	examples : [ collected via facebook , may 2013 ] <PARA> new police radar will catch you off guard <PARA> you know how when your late or on a trip trying to “ make time ” you become a little bit of a lead foot ? well now you not only have to watch for police cars . here is the all new guardrail embedded radar system ! less staff needed . which is good in one way , when you call for help more police will be available . bad , because now you have to watch for bulging guardrails as well ! <PARA> origins : although we can ’ t say for sure exactly where it ’ s located or whether it ’ s currently operational , the object embedded in a roadside guardrail is an example of an automated lidar ( light detection and ranging ) device used for traffic speed enforcement . lidar systems are similar to the radar systems currently employed for the detection of speeding motorists , but they use lasers rather than radio waves and therefore offer the advantages of working better in congested traffic conditions and are less detectable than radar ( although the latter has greater range ): <PARA> radar shoots out a short , high - intensity burst of high - frequency radio waves in a cone - shaped pattern . officers who have been through the painfully technical 40 - hour doppler radar training course know it will detect a variety of objects within that cone pattern , such as the closest target , the fastest moving target or the largest target . officers are trained to differentiate and properly match targets down range to the radar readings they receive . under most conditions , skilled users get good results with radar , and it is found to be most effective for open stretches of roadway . but for more congested areas , locking radar on a specific target is more difficult . <PARA> lidar utilizes laser technology , allowing for superior target acquisition in high - volume traffic areas . according to carl fors of texas - based speed measurement laboratories inc ., “ laser systems are the most accurate means of providing traffic and speed analysis compared to other systems . a laser can pinpoint one vehicle in a group while radar can ’ t . a laser beam is a mere 18 inches wide at 500 feet compared to a radar beam ’ s width of some 150 feet .” in congested traffic areas , an officer can very effectively use lidar to pick out a specific target , site it and read its speed without any concern for interference from other close - by targets . <PARA> this small beam width has another added benefit — it cannot be detected until after a speed measurement is already made . testing of the most advanced detectors has shown that when officers aim properly ( at the vehicle ’ s front license plate instead of the windshield where the detector usually sits ), the signal often goes undetected . <PARA> a company sales brochure for the lms - 06 traffic observer digital traffic surveillance unit illustrates and explains how the particular lidar system shown above works : <PARA> note that the “ hidden ” guardrail unit shown in these photographs simply measures the speed of passing cars . in this particular type of traffic enforcement system , a second and much more conspicuous unit is located slightly farther down the road from the speed measurement device to record and store images of offending vehicles : <PARA> some older blog posts indicate the photographs displayed above were taken along the a8 motorway in belgium in 2007 . a google maps street view captured a view of a similar roadside lidar unit in switzerland : <PARA> we note that lidar systems like the one shown above are not authorized for law enforcement use in all countries and jurisdictions , and that they can be employed for traffic monitoring purposes as well as speed limit enforcement . as far as we know , the system pictured above is not currently being used in the united states .
unproven	on 28 september 2015 , the web site mr . democratic published a article with the misleading headline of “ al sharpton ’ s $ 4 . 5 million tax debt ‘ forgiven ’ by obama administration ,” asserting that : <PARA> the claims made in that piece were based on a series of articles published in 2014 by the new york times and the new york post in 2014 which asserted that sharpton owed more than $ 4 . 5 million in back taxes . sharpton confirmed that he owed a tax debt , but he insisted that it was less than was widely reported and said that he had been paying down the debt : <PARA> it is true that sharpton faced tax liens from state and federal agencies in 2014 , but exactly how much he might have owed in back taxes , how much of that debt was personal ( as opposed to organizational ), and how much of it has since been paid off is exceedingly difficult to determine in light of federal and state privacy laws . regardless , the claim made by mr . democratic that these debts were “ forgiven ” by the obama administration is not based on any factual evidence , but the unfounded assumption that since al sharpton isn ’ t in prison , he must have friends in the white house who stepped in and wiped out his debt . <PARA> the much more likely reason that al sharpton is not in prison is that he has been cooperating with the irs to pay off the back taxes . the irs ’ primary interest is in collecting monies owed ( which can be difficult to accomplish when a debtor is in prison ); therefore , they generally target the most flagrantly and habitually criminal and uncooperative of tax evaders to the justice department for prosecution and instead seek to recover back taxes from other debtors through a combination of arranging of repayment plans and civil proceedings .

false	a viral story on shareably first published in may 2018 claims that a mixture of orange juice and cream of tartar “ will flush nicotine from your body and [ help you ] quit smoking faster .” though shareably ’ s article is currently driving the bulk of viral traffic on this subject , the claim has a history on the internet going back at least a decade . <PARA> before diving into the science , several reasons exist to be suspicious of the article from a media literacy standpoint . far from citing any peer - reviewed scientific paper , the article states that its primary source of information is an article from the company providr , a clickbait mill snopes exposed for fraudulent facebook practices in multiple 2018 investigations . the article itself , which in reality devotes only a few sentences to the headline claim , cites questionable websites like natural health and healing 4 you and organic facts to support its argument . finally , that claim relies on one of the most overused tropes in pseudoscientific literature : the notion of “ detoxifying your body ” through nutrition : <PARA> potassium tartrate ( and other potassium chemicals ) exists as potassium ions in the body , which are undeniably crucial for several important cellular processes , and a factor in multiple health conditions . despite its chemical importance , no scientific basis exists for any claim that it can affect the removal of nicotine from the body or ease the cessation of smoking . instead , shareably relies on vague , scientific sounding non sequiturs that do not actually provide support for the headline claim . <PARA> patrick mulholland , a professor at the medical university of south carolina and an expert in the biological processes underlying addiction , described the claim as “ ridiculous ,” telling us via email that “ there is currently no known mechanism by which increasing [ potassium ] in the diet will reduce smoking or relapse in individuals with nicotine dependence .” <PARA> the most obvious implication made with these vague internet claims is that smoking somehow lowers levels of potassium in the body — a medical condition known as hypokalemia . “ there is no evidence that smoking itself causes hypokalemia ” mulholland told us . in fact , he added , “ acute nicotine exposure can increase [ potassium ] levels ” in the bloodstream . in other words , smoking cigarettes , while undeniably bad for your health , does not create a potassium deficiency in the body that could be rectified by the addition of more potassium . ( as another problem , “ little is known ” about how potassium levels in the body are affected by diet in the first place .) <PARA> what about the claim that potassium helps “ flush ” nicotine out of the body by “ get [ ing ] your adrenal glands working in conjunction with the rest of your body ” such that “ your body naturally decides which toxins to eliminate through bowel movements , urine , and sweat ?” this is essentially gibberish . cream of tartar has “ a long history ” as a purging agent for one simple reason : it has a diuretic effect , which means it increases the amount of water expelled from the body in urine . <PARA> it is unclear , however , how that action would serve to increase the metabolism — i . e . breakdown — of nicotine . these chemicals are broken down into metabolites by the liver before being excreted as urine . further , from an addiction standpoint , the rapid removal of nicotine from the body — even if potassium tartrate could cause that effect — would counterproductively serve to increase the frequency of cravings , not reduce them . <PARA> the alleged role shareably suggests vitamin c plays in this process is even less precise . a closer look at these arguments reveals them to be especially flimsy . the first proffered argument does not actually provide support for the assertion that potassium helps you remove nicotine and / or quit smoking , it merely suggests adding the orange juice to replace all the lost vitamins from the purging . to be clear , this would be a solution to a problem that didn ’ t exist before the treatment , not a path toward quitting smoking . <PARA> another explanation they provide is simpler , but decidedly less - impressive sounding : “ drinking [ orange juice and cream of tartar ] will drastically alter the way things taste , including cigarettes ,” implying that the unpleasant taste would make people less likely to smoke . this explanation may hold the closest relevance to their claims of smoking cessation , but it is one that is unsupported by any actual scientific research . the national institute on drug abuse does not endorse that notion , and a review of the literature suggests that very few people , if any , have tested it . <PARA> as a final note , consuming too much cream of tartar can lead to adverse health effects on its own — there have been rare cases of “ life - threatening ” hyperkalemia ( too much potassium ) resulting from people using cream of tartar as a cleanse . <PARA> one of the driving features of pseudoscientific clickbait is that it floods a reader with bits and pieces of actual science that are then misrepresented or distorted . this article is no different . <PARA> for example , the piece asserts that “ low potassium is associated with just about every single health issue caused by smoking .” correlation is not causation . the association presented here is used to falsely suggest that because people with low potassium and people who smoke share similar medical maladies , supplementation with potassium would be the solution . the problem with this argument is that one of the most common symptoms that chronic smokers experience is also the defining feature of hypokalemia : hypertension . hypertension , in turn , is a major factor in most of the other complications — cardiac problems , etc . — at issue in smoking . that link does not mean smoking - connected hypertension is related to potassium levels in the bloodstream , nor has any research been published supporting that notion . <PARA> similarly , the article asserts that nicotine “ blocks your ability to adequately absorb [ vitamin c ] into the blood .” while it is true that smokers generally have lower levels of vitamin c in their body , this association is used to support the notion that vitamin c has an important role to play in smoking - related maladies without ever explaining what role vitamin c deficiency is alleged to play in either preventing the removal of nicotine from the body or prolonging someone ’ s efforts to quit smoking . <PARA> because no published support exists for the claim that cream of tartar can play any role in either the removal of nicotine from the body or as an aid to quit smoking , and because the scientific facts used to make that argument are incorrect , distorted , or irrelevant , we rank this claim “ false .”

wilshire trader joe ’ s to stock up on the wine selling at an astonishing $ 1 . 99 a bottle . “ i had to come and get a case ,” she said in a checkout line with half a dozen other shoppers who had somehow heard of the mysterious “ napa ” wine . <PARA> since it was introduced in february , charles shaw wine has gained a cult - like following in southern california , with wine drinkers backing their cars up to the loading dock of the los angeles - based discounter to lay in a supply of the trader joe ’ s exclusive . <PARA> “ it ’ s selling like crazy ,” said jon fredrikson , a wine consultant based in san mateo county . “ a great story for consumers .” <PARA> since it was introduced in february , charles shaw wine has gained a cult - like following in southern california , with wine drinkers backing their cars up to the loading dock of the los angeles - based discounter to lay in a supply of the trader joe ’ s exclusive . <PARA> “ it ’ s selling like crazy ,” said jon fredrikson , a wine consultant based in san mateo county . “ a great story for consumers .” <PARA> why was such a popular wine ( charles shaw was one of the top 20 brands in the u . s .) being sold so cheaply ? as usual , consumers collectively created several inventive urban legend - like explanations for this seemingly inexplicable phenomenon : <PARA> also as usual , the real explanation why many wine brands ( not just charles shaw ) could be had so cheaply at the time ( 2001 ) was a mundane one : the market was experiencing a wine glut . the wine boom of the 1990s led vineyards to increase production , but a downturn in the u . s . economy <PARA> and the effects of september 11 resulted in a greatly lessened demand ( particularly in the restaurant industry ), creating such an oversupply that many wines were selling for less than the cost of production . some vintners in northern california were even allowing their grapes to wither on the vine because the cost of picking them exceeded their market value . <PARA> the charles shaw label ( known in local slang as “ two - buck chuck ”) was the focus of those “ cheap wine ” rumors because it bore a prestigious napa label , even though it sold for less than $ 2 per bottle . the catch was that it ’ s made with cheaper grapes from california ’ s central valley rather than more desirable grapes from the napa valley , but because the label ’ s parent company does own a winery and bottling facility in napa , it is allowed to put “ napa ” on the charles shaw label ( which only indicates that the wine is “ bottled and cellared ” in napa ) even if the grapes used in the wine actually come from some other part of california : <PARA> [ w ] ine industry experts say that despite the classy napa label , there probably isn ’ t a hint of those pricey grapes in a bottle of charles shaw merlot , chardonnay or cabernet sauvignon . <PARA> even with the depressed market , grapes from napa sell for around $ 2 , 000 a ton , said brian sudano of beverage marketing corp . to make money on a $ 2 bottle , he added , a vintner would have to buy grapes for around $ 200 a ton — the price of less desirable central valley grapes . <PARA> this summer the market price for those grapes hit a low of $ 60 a ton . swimming in excess wine , [ bronco wine co . head ] franzia revived the charles shaw label , believing it would be more cost - effective to dump his wine on the consumer market than to pour it on the ground . taking advantage of the depressed wine grape market , he also bought up excess stock from other central valley vintners , according to several wine industry sources . <PARA> “ franzia was able to take advantage of distress sales by other vineyards , said [ wine consultant jon ] fredrikson . “ and he ’ s got the high - speed production lines to do it and still make money .” <PARA> even with the depressed market , grapes from napa sell for around $ 2 , 000 a ton , said brian sudano of beverage marketing corp . to make money on a $ 2 bottle , he added , a vintner would have to buy grapes for around $ 200 a ton — the price of less desirable central valley grapes . <PARA> this summer the market price for those grapes hit a low of $ 60 a ton . swimming in excess wine , [ bronco wine co . head ] franzia revived the charles shaw label , believing it would be more cost -

described vintner who once caustically asserted on quora , in a since deleted response to an inquiry about why trader joe ’ s wine ( and the charles shaw blend in particular ) was sold so cheaply , that those wines were inexpensive to buy because they were ... well , made cheaply : <PARA> the basic gist of it all is that two buck chuck is owned by bronco wines , which is owned by fred franzia , a trash - mouthed , unapologetic downright crude and shrewd business man who sees it as his mission to pretty much remove any shred of pretentiousness ( and dare i say integrity and quality along with it ) from the wine world . <PARA> he started by buying the then failing charles shaw label years ago along with massive amounts of bulk wine in the 90 ’ s for pennies on the dollar and a staggering 35 , 000 acres of land in the very cheap san joaquin valley which he then planted to vines . that gives his bronco wines the prestige of holding the most acreage of vines of any american winery , even surpassing mondavi and gallo . <PARA> a few things to keep in mind about his vineyards : one is that they are located in what is known as the central valley in the california wine world which is notoriously flat and quite hot producing massive yields of overripe grapes . the other thing is that fred franzia is no dummy — he planted those vineyards in such a way as the rows run north - south , giving the vines maximum sun exposure and he made the rows as long as he possibly could , minimizing the number of turns his tractors would need to make . and third , these aren ’ t hand - picked vineyards ... they are all machine harvested . and that means these large tractors with huge claws go down the rows of vineyards grabbing the grapes and depositing them in its huge receptacle . and it not only grabs ripe grapes , but unripe and down right rotten ones as well and throws them all together . add to that leaves , stems and any rodents , birds , or insects that may have made those vines their home — they all get thrown into the bin as well . and guess what ? you think there ’ s going to be any sorting when that truck arrives at the winery ( or should i say processing facility )? nope . everything , and i do mean everything ( including all those unripe grapes , rotten grapes , leaves , stems , birds , rodents , and insects ) gets tossed into the crusher and transferred to large tanks to ferment . so think about all the animal blood and parts that may have made their way into your wine next time you crack open that bottle of two buck chuck ! hardly even seems worth the $ 2 does it ? <PARA> if you were to taste that wine right after it was made , i guarantee you it would be undrinkable . they will then manipulate the finished wine in whatever way necessary , including adding sugar or unfermented grape juice if needed to make the wine palatable . and then the wine goes into bottling , packaging and shipping facilities , all of which fred franzia owns himself . they then get put on trucks ( also owned by fred franzia ) and shipped to trader joe ’ s . the only part of the process fred doesn ’ t own is trader joe ’ s itself and i ’ m sure if he got his way , he ’ d include that in his empire as well . <PARA> so the summary is this — to make $ 2 wine one must compromise all sense of integrity and quality , own tens of thousands of acres of vineyards in the worst possible wine region possible where land is incredibly cheap and yields are exceptionally high , use machines to execute every part of a homogenized system that substitutes manipulation for hand crafted quality , and own every step of the winemaking process including bottling , packaging and distribution , all while giving the finger to the entire wine industry and plowing down anyone who gets in your way . <PARA> he started by buying the then failing charles shaw label years ago along with massive amounts of bulk wine in the 90 ’ s for pennies on the dollar and a staggering 35 , 000 acres of land in the very cheap san joaquin valley which he then planted to vines . that gives his bronco wines the prestige of holding the most acreage of vines of any american winery , even surpassing mondavi and gallo . <PARA> a few things to keep in mind about his vineyards : one is that they are located in what is known as the central valley in the california wine world which is notoriously flat and quite hot producing massive yields of overripe grapes . the other thing is that fred franzia is no dummy — he planted those vineyards in such a way as the rows run north -

false	origins : the curtiss candy company was <PARA> founded in chicago in 1916 by otto schnering . schnering , who wanted a name more “ american - sounding ” than his own for the company ( german surnames not being much of an asset during world war i ), used his mother ’ s maiden name instead . <PARA> the curtiss candy company ’ s first product was a confection known as kandy kake , which featured a pastry center topped with nuts and coated with chocolate . this candy bar was only a moderate success until 1921 , when schnering reintroduced it as a log - shaped bar made of caramel and peanuts , covered with chocolate . schnering named his new confection the “ baby ruth ” bar , priced it at five cents ( half the cost of other bars ), and soon had one of the hottest - selling candy bars on the market . <PARA> three explanations have since been offered concerning the origins of the “ baby ruth ” candy bar ’ s name : <PARA> explanation # 1 is the “ official ” explanation that has been proffered by the curtiss candy company since the 1920s . <PARA> explanation # 2 is the “ obvious ” explanation ; the one assumed by people who have not been exposed to any theories about the candy ’ s origin . <PARA> explanation # 3 is an alternate explanation proffered by syndicated columnist l . m . boyd that can be readily dismissed . the williamson candy company , producer of the “ oh ! henry ” bar , was a direct competitor of curtiss ’ and would have been most unlikely to supply a product name and formula to a rival . furthermore , the curtiss candy company has never claimed this as an origin of its candy bar ’ s <PARA> name . <PARA> the claim that the “ baby ruth ” bar was named after ruth cleveland is found dubious by many because ruth cleveland died of diphtheria in 1904 , over seventeen years before the “ baby ruth ” bar was first produced . naming a candy bar after the long - dead daughter of a former president would certainly be a curious choice . moreover , the notion that a candy bar called “ baby ruth ” should appear on the market just when a baseball player named babe ruth had suddenly become the most famous person in america is perceived as a rather striking coincidence . <PARA> if the curtiss candy company did indeed appropriate babe ruth ’ s name without permission , it would have had a motive for developing a fabricated yet believable explanation in case a challenge arose over the candy bar ’ s name . curtiss did indeed have to fight off at least one challenge to its name , when a competitor ( with the full approval of babe ruth ) attempted to market a candy named the “ babe ruth home run bar .” curtiss , claiming that its candy bar was named for ruth cleveland , was successful in forcing the competing candy bar off the market because its rival ’ s name too closely resembled that of its own product . <PARA> the fact that curtiss successfully fought off a challenge to its candy bar ’ s name does not demonstrate that the company was untruthful , however . merely showing that it might have had a reason to lie is not evidence of any disingenuousness on its part ; we must prove that curtiss did in fact lie about the origins of the “ baby ruth ” name . although we may not be able to show that curtiss was less than honest when it was fighting off the challenge of the “ babe ruth home run bar ”, we can certainly demonstrate that it has been dishonest about the origin of the name “ baby ruth ” in the years since then . <PARA> first of all , the official curtiss position maintained for many years is that its “ candy bar made its initial appearance in 1921 , some years before babe ruth . . . became famous .” in 1919 , babe ruth was a standout pitcher for the red sox , but he was not well - known outside of boston and the baseball world . sold to the new york yankees prior to the 1920 season , ruth soon established himself as an outfield star and was nationally famous by the end of the year . by 1921 his name was featured more prominently on the front pages of afternoon newspapers than president harding ’ s . the claim that he was not famous until “ some years ” after 1921 is nothing but absurd . this misstatement could merely be a mistake on curtiss ’ part due to shoddy record - keeping or research , but the claim has been offered for so many years and is so easily verifiable that it is hard to explain as anything other than dissembling . <PARA> another claim made by the curtiss candy company is much harder to dismiss as mere bad record - keeping , though . part of the official statement about the “ baby ruth ” name offered by curtiss has been that ruth cleveland “ visited the curtiss candy company plant years ago when the company was getting started and this largely influenced the company ’ s founder to name the candy bar ‘ baby ruth .'” ruth cleveland died at age twelve in 1904 ; no amount of bad record - keeping can place her in the factory of a company that wouldn ’ t exist until more than a decade after her death .

false	outdated <PARA> origins : in june 2015 a debate over the display of the confederate flag at the south carolina state house followed a racially - motivated shooting at the emanuel african methodist episcopal church in downtown charleston , during which nine people were killed . in the tragedy ’ s immediate aftermath , many businesses and local jurisdictions removed or stopped selling confederate flags , as political and social issues regarding that symbol once again became heated and high - profile . <PARA> a number of rumors about additional actions involving the confederate flag began to circulate , among them a claim that a petition sought to remove the historic confederate memorial carving from stone mountain park , georgia . that rumor began to spread on facebook via a post that initially stated : <PARA> other posts linked to a huffington post article titled “ stone mountain petition stokes controversy ; georgia man wants confederate monument remade ,” which reported : <PARA> however , that article was dated 1 may 2013 , more than two years prior to the june 2015 debate over the confederate flag , and was therefore not a relevant or current aspect of the june 2015 confederate flag controversy . the facebook post linked above was accordingly appended with the following update : <PARA> in short , an effort was once undertaken — involving one individual ’ s starting an online petition — to replace the stone mountain carving . however , that movement began and ended in 2013 ( the petition was closed well short of reaching its stated goal of 10 , 000 supporters ) and was unrelated to the controversy over confederate flags that erupted in june 2015 . content from may 2013 ( when the petition to alter the stone mountain carving was live ) began to circulate in june 2015 , leading many readers to believe that confederate flag opponents had “ moved on ” to eradicating the bas relief sculpture ; but we found no evidence of new efforts targeting the georgia monument . <PARA> originally published : 25 june 2015
true	on 25 august 2017 , wnd reported that the san domenico independent catholic school in san anselmo , california had removed dozens of statues of catholic and christian figures , including christ , from the school ’ s campus : <PARA> the story extensively cites an earlier article published by a local newspaper , the marin independent journal , which quotes some parents and community members as being concerned about the removal of the statues , as well as school officials and board members defending it . <PARA> on 26 august 2017 , conservative site bizpac review followed up with its own report , writing : <PARA> it ’ s true that san domenico has been removing catholic statues from its campus , and that this has been part of an ongoing effort to be more inclusive and appeal to non - catholic prospective students . however , while reports do mention the fact that san domenico is an independent catholic school , they don ’ t clearly explain what this means for the school ’ s ethos and strategic planning , and why the decision to remove the statues is a good deal less surprising when san domenico ’ s status as an independent catholic school ( as opposed to a diocesan catholic school ) is taken into consideration . <PARA> a spokesperson for san domenico told us that the school had removed six out of sixteen statues from campus , leaving ten . wnd ’ s claim that the school had removed “ more than 160 statues ” is therefore false by a wide margin . school authorities also recently moved a statue of saint dominic — the school ’ s patron saint — to a more prominent place on campus and added a plaque to honor him . <PARA> the san domenico school was founded in 1850 as an independent catholic school by the dominican sisters of san rafael . in 1965 , it became an independent nonprofit organization . it is not a diocesan school , which means it has never been under the control of the catholic church hierarchy . <PARA> diocesan catholic schools are owned and run by local catholic archdioceses ( regional divisions of the church throughout the united states and the rest of the world ). they therefore form part of the church hierarchy which ultimately extends upwards to the vatican . <PARA> san domenico school ( like other independent catholic schools ) exists outside this realm , and therefore has independence in balancing its dominican catholic heritage and ethos with its emphasis on cultural and religious inclusivity and diversity . one manifestation of this difference is that students at diocesan schools are generally taught catholic dogma , while students at schools like san domenico are not ; instead , they receive instruction in “ religious studies ”. <PARA> in the lower school , this curriculum is known as “ religious studies and character development ”. students are taught to develop a “ moral framework for making ethical decisions which guide personal choices and interpersonal relationships .” in the middle school , this means pupils study the bible , quran , buddhism and do comparative research on major world religions . in the upper school , students are offered classes in global studies , philosophy , the history of christianity , and zen buddhism , among others . <PARA> the school is run by a board of trustees . in 2016 , just three of the board ’ s 26 members were from the dominican sisters of san rafael . a spokesperson for the school told us that approximately 80 percent of the school ’ s parents and students do not identify as catholic . <PARA> in june 2016 , the board of trustees approved a new strategic plan for the school . the second of its five main goals was : “ strengthen san domenico ’ s identity as an independent school and clearly articulate our inclusive spiritual foundation .” <PARA> there is historical context for this effort , according to the strategic plan ( page 8 ): <PARA> finally , it should be noted that the decision to remove some catholic statues from public visibility on san domenico ’ s campus does not appear to have come from any external pressure or the implacable forces of “ political correctness ”. it ’ s a step that school authorities themselves have chosen as part of san domenico ’ s evolution , and it is fully in keeping with the school ’ s stated philosophy of inclusivity and diversity .
false	an article about “ life in the 1500s ” was nothing more than an extended joke , someone ’ s idea of an amusing leg - pull which began its internet life in april 1999 . all of the historical and linguistic facts it purported to offer were simply made up and contrary to documented facts : <PARA> “ most people married young , like at the age of 11 or 12 .” <PARA> this is just plain wrong . even in the 1500s , nearly the only people who wed that early were the progeny of royalty , and those unions were formed for political reasons and thus were much more paper marriages than real ones . a “ bride ” of tender years might be called upon to travel to her new homeland , where she would take up residence with her husband ’ s family and live like their daughter <PARA> until such time as both kids were deemed old enough to advance the state of their union into full - blown matrimony . to put it more directly , though the teens might call each other “ husband ” and “ wife ,” they didn ’ t begin cohabiting and having sex until their mid - teens at the earliest , and only when both families agreed the kids were ready to take this step . <PARA> a perfect example of such a union was the 1499 marriage between catherine of aragon ( spain ) and arthur , eldest son of henry vii of england . they were married by proxy in their native lands when arthur was 14 and catherine was 15 . catherine did not arrive in england until 1501 , when the young royals were wed again , this time in person . although controversy exists as to whether they might have had sexual congress before arthur ’ s death in 1502 , if they had done so , they accomplished it by sneaking behind everybody ’ s back . both sets of parents were of the opinion the youngsters should not begin this aspect of marital life too early , and they worked to prevent such a change in affairs by housing the youngsters separately , as well as by charging catherine ’ s spanish duenna to maintain a watchful eye on the pair . it was said henry vii ’ s mother , margaret beaufort , was ruined by early childbirth ( she bore henry at age 13 and did not afterwards have other children though she was married four times ), and henry was not about to risk the succession of his line on another one - child mom . equally as important was the thought common to that time that early sexual excesses could fatally weaken the health of young men . a teen prince who bedded too often , it was feared , was digging himself into an early grave . <PARA> some other “ delayed consummation ” marriages of that general era were : <PARA> as stated earlier , though early marriages were common among the royals of that era , they were far from the norm among ordinary citizens . granted , there might have been a few such early unions , but the practice was not as portrayed in this e - mail , which states that “ most people married young , like at the age of 11 or 12 .” <PARA> according to stephanie coontz , who wrote in the 2005 bestseller marriage : a history , “ in england between 1500 and 1700 the median age of first marriage for women was twenty - six .” <PARA> “ everyone just wrapped up in their blanket and slept on the floor . they had no indoor heating so all the extra bodies kept them warm .” <PARA> this statement would hold true in 11th and 12th century england , when it was common practice for every member of the great households to bed down on the reed - strewn floor of the main hall . ( some of the more fortunate had flock mattresses to cushion them .) northern europe was at that time experiencing warmer - than - usual temperatures , which made such sleeping arrangements livable . the pendulum soon swung the other way , with the coming of a “ little ice age ” at the beginning of the 13th century . <PARA> this startling turn of climatic events ( which was to last for the next 200 years ) spelled the end to that style of communal living and brought about major shifts in building styles to better protect people from the horrendous cold . the advent of the chimney made it possible to warm smaller spaces , which led to the concept of sleeping singly or in pairs in bedrooms . all this is to say that by the 1500s one would have been hard pressed to find any homes that were not heated , or where the inhabitants shivered piled up together in a communal dogpile . <PARA> “ most people got married in june . why ? they took their yearly bath in may , so they were till smelling pretty good by june , although they were starting to smell , so the brides would carry a bouquet of flowers to hide their b . o .” <PARA> although the modern practice of full - immersion bathing was a long way off in the 1500s ( among other reasons because filling a vessel large enough to hold a person with heated water was rather impractical given the effort required to collect fresh water and fuel for heating it ), people did still “ bathe ” in the sense of attempting to clean themselves as best they could with the resources at hand . <PARA> although today ’ s brides carry flowers simply because it is now the custom to do so , at one time bridal bouquets were symbols of sexuality and fertility . covering up anyone ’ s bad smell played no part in why this custom came into being . <PARA> “ like i said , they took their yearly bath in may , but it was just a big tub that they would fill with hot water . the man of the house would get the privilege of the nice clean water . then all the other sons and men , then the women and finally the children . last of all the babies . by then the water was pretty thick . thus , the saying , “ don ’ t throw the baby out with the bath water ,” it was so dirty you could actually lose someone in it .” <PARA> although the admonition against throwing the baby out with the bathwater dates back to the 16th century , its roots are germanic , not english . its first written occurrence was in thomas murner ’ s 1512 versified satirical book narrenbeschwörung , and its meaning is purely metaphorical . ( in simpler terms , no literal babies or bathwater , just a memorable mental image meant to drive home a bit of advice against overreaction .) <PARA> “ i ’ ll describe their houses a little . you ’ ve heard of thatch roofs , well that ’ s all they were . thick straw , piled high , with no wood underneath . they were the only place for the little animals to get warm . so all the pets ; dogs , cats and other small animals , mice , rats , bugs , all lived in the roof . when it rained it became slippery so sometimes the animals would slip and fall off the roof . thus the saying , ‘ it ’ s raining cats and dogs .'” <PARA> mice , rats , and bugs definitely take up residence in thatch roofs — to them it ’ s a highrise hay mow . cats and dogs , however , don ’ t go up there . <PARA> the saying it ’ s raining cats and dogs was first noted in the 17th century , not the 16th . a number of theories as to its origin exist : <PARA> “ since there was nothing to stop things from falling into the house they would just try to clean up a lot . but this posed a real problem in the bedroom where bugs and other droppings from animals could really mess up your nice clean bed , so they found if they would make beds with big posts and hang a sheet over the top it would prevent that problem . that ’ s where those beautiful big 4 poster beds with canopies came from .” <PARA> canopied four - poster beds were the province of the well - to - do , not the ordinary folk . possibly their origin had to do with a desire to display wealth conspicuously by showing off rich tapestries and fabrics . beautifully thick wall hangings were likewise a way of dressing up a room while at the same time putting on the dog a bit . ( the hangings also served to keep the warmth of a room in .) such fripperies were not the norm in lesser households where available funds would more likely be directed to keeping people fed and clothed than to decorative flourishes . <PARA> “ when you came into the house you would notice most times that the floor was dirt . only the wealthy had something other than dirt , that ’ s where the saying ‘ dirt poor ’ came from .” <PARA> “ dirt poor ” is an american expression , not a british one . claims that the saying grew out of british class distinctions as measured by style of flooring are therefore specious . as mentioned briefly above in the “ everybody slept on the floor ” discussion , floors of that era were rarely bare dirt anyway : fresh reeds were laid on them every day and thrown out every night , with another fresh set brought in for sleeping on . in the summer months , aromatic herbs might be added to this vegetative underfooting . <PARA> “ the wealthy would have slate floors . that was fine but in the winter they would get slippery when they got wet . so they started to spread thresh on the floor to help keep their footing . as the winter wore on they would just keep adding it and adding it until when you opened the door it would all start slipping outside . so they put a piece of wood at the entry way , a ‘ thresh hold .’” <PARA> as stated above , the reeds used on floors were typically changed daily . besides , who ever heard of calling reeds , rushes , or sheaves of grass “ threshes ”? one threshes plants to separate stalk from seed , but no part of the plant is called the “ thresh .” <PARA> the “ thresh ” part of threshold apparently comes from a prehistoric source that denoted “ making noise ” and is related to the old church slavonik tresku , meaning “ crash .” by the time it reached germanic ( thresk -), it was probably being used for “ stamp the feet noisily ” ( something that ’ s a good idea to do in a doorway if you ’ re wearing muddy boots ). <PARA> “ in the kitchen they would cook over the fire , they had a fireplace in the kitchen / parlor , that was seldom used and sometimes in the master bedroom . they had a big kettle that always hung over the fire and every day they would light the fire and start adding things to the pot . <PARA> mostly they ate vegetables , they didn ’ t get much meat . they would eat the stew for dinner then leave the leftovers in the pot to get cold overnight and then start over the next day . sometimes the stew would have food in it that had been in there for a month ! thus the rhyme : ‘ peas porridge hot , peas porridge cold , peas porridge in the pot nine days old .’” <PARA> this entry might claim a bit of legitimacy , as even some cooking practices of today call for tossing whatever ’ s on hand into the stewpot , with new ingredients added each day to whatever is left over . french bouillabaisse , for instance , is sometimes made this way , as are any number of “ peasants ’ stews .” <PARA> “ sometimes they could get a hold on some pork . they really felt special when that happened and when company came over they even had a rack in the parlor where they would bring out some bacon and hang it to show it off . that was a sign of wealth and that a man ‘ could really bring home the bacon .’” <PARA> some linguists believe the saying “ bring home the bacon ” long predates the 16th century , stemming from the 12th century and referring to a time when a slab of bacon was awarded to the happiest married couple ( a practice referred to by chaucer in the wife of bath ’ s tale and prologue ). a man who “ brought home the bacon ” therefore wasn ’ t showing how good a provider he was but rather demonstrating the success of his marriage . other linguists believe the “ bacon ” might refer to the pig used in the greased pig chase common to many local fairs : the winner ’ s prize was the pig itself , thus the skilled pig catcher got to “ bring home the bacon .” <PARA> “ they would cut off a little to share with guests and they would all sit around and “ chew the fat .”” <PARA> usage of the term “ chewing the fat ” hasn ’ t been documented prior to the latter part of the 19th century , so it certainly wasn ’ t a phrase that originated during the 1500s . theories have linked it to sailors attempting to chomp on the tough rind found in salt pork sea rations , native americans chewing animal hides during their spare time , and farmers in britain chewing on smoked pork , but there is no solid linguistic evidence proving any of these theories . as richard lederer put it , “ what seems clear is that chewing the fat , like shooting the breeze , provides little sustenance for the amount of mastication involved .” <PARA> “ if you had money your plates were made out of pewter . sometimes some of their food had a high acid content and some of the lead would leach out into the food . they really noticed it happened with tomatoes . so they stopped eating tomatoes , for 400 years .” <PARA> tomatoes are not native to europe and thus were not spread to that continent until after the spanish colonization of the americas . although tomatoes were first cultivated in britain in the late 16th century , it wasn ’ t until about the mid - 18th century that they became common fare in that region . the slowness of their adoption as a staple food was not due to discovery that tomatoes were acidic and that lead from pewter plates therefore leached into them , however . many people believed tomatoes to be dangerous to eat because they resembled other plants known to be poisonous , such as henbane , mandrake , and deadly nightshade , so for a long time the tomato was considered primarily an ornamental plant ; eating its fruit was considered to be distasteful and potentially harmful . <PARA> “ most people didn ’ t have pewter plates though , they all had trenchers , that was a piece of wood with the middle scooped out like a bowl .” <PARA> “ trencher ” is a medieval word that comes from the french trancher , “ to slice ,” which shouldn ’ t seem all the remarkable when viewed in the light of the earliest ones being made from sliced bread and used at banquets to receive morsels taken from a central dish and for soaking up any dripping sauces . food that needed to be pierced or cut was not placed on a bread trencher . trenchers started to receive pewter or wooden underplaques ( also called trenchers ) in the 14th century . though these underplaques were sometimes used as plates to eat from , by custom the more common use called upon them to support a bread platform for food until sometime in the 16th century . <PARA> “ they never washed their boards and a lot of times worms would get into the wood .” <PARA> by the mid - 16th century , what had been the wooden underplaque was coming to be viewed as dinner plate in its own right . wooden trenchers that could hold both solid and liquid foods came into vogue , with some having separate hollows to house diners ’ salt . wooden trenchers were typically washed after every use , though . <PARA> “ after eating off the trencher with worms they would get ‘ trench mouth .‘” <PARA> “ trench mouth ” wasn ’ t a term until 1918 , according to the oxford english dictionary , and the “ trench ” part of the term referred to the trenches of world war i . trench mouth is a bacterial infection of the mouth called “ acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis .” soldiers sharing water bottles ( as they did while cooped up for months at a time under enemy fire in the trenches of world war i ) passed the disease to each other in record numbers , hence the simpler name this disease came to be known by . worms never played any part in this . <PARA> “ if you were going traveling and wanted to stay at an inn they usually provided the bed but not the board .” <PARA> no matter how you parse “ board ” in the previous sentence , inns were in the business of providing it . travelers paid extra for their meals , but food was to be had at any place that deemed itself worthy of the name “ inn .” ( those that wanted only a room could get just that too .) <PARA> the “ board ” in “ bed and board ” ( or “ room and board ”) refers to the board table or sideboard where food was laid out , not an eating utensil . common usage came to shift this meaning away from the furniture itself and to encompass the food served from it . <PARA> “ the bread was divided according to status . the workers would get the burnt bottom of the loaf , the family would get the middle and guests would get the top , or the ‘ upper crust .’” <PARA> although an admonition to “ kutt the upper crust [ of a loaf of bread ] for your soverayne ” can be found in a 1460 work , the term ‘ upper crust ’ didn ’ t come to be used figuratively to refer to persons of the higher classes until the 19th century . many have speculated that the phrase “ upper crust ” originated with a custom of slicing the choice top portion off a loaf and presenting it to the highest - ranking guests at the table , but there is no documentary evidence supporting this as the phrase ’ s actual origin . <PARA> “ they also had lead cups and when they would drink their ale or whiskey . the combination would sometimes knock them out for a couple of days . they would be walking along the road and here would be someone knocked out and they thought they were dead . so they would pick them up and take them home and get them ready to bury . they realized if they were too slow about it , the person would wake up . also , maybe not all of the people they were burying were dead . so they would lay them out on the kitchen table for a couple of days , the family would gather around and eat and drink and wait and see if they would wake up . that ’ s where the custom of holding a ‘ wake ’ came from .” <PARA> waking the dead is an ancient custom that extends around the world and has existed in europe for at least the past thousand years . the term refers to the practice of watching over the corpse during the period between death and burial . partly , this had to do with making sure someone was always around in case the corpse woke up ( see our buried alive page for numerous stories about premature interments ), but the watchers were also there to make sure household animals and assorted vermin were kept off the deceased . <PARA> some so feared the possibility of live burial that they left instructions for special tests to be performed on their bodies to make sure they were actually dead . surgical incisions , the application of boiling hot liquids , touching red - hot irons to their flesh , stabbing them through the heart , or even decapitation were all specified at different times as a way of making sure these people didn ’ t wake up six feet under . <PARA> “ since england is so old and small they started running out of places to bury people . so they started digging up some coffins and would take their bones to a house and re - use the grave .” <PARA> burying the dead in previously - used graves happened with some frequency throughout europe , both before , during , and after the 1500s . it didn ’ t have to do with any particular country being too small to hold all the dead bodies , though : it had to do with the shortage of space in established cemeteries . the family of the deceased would habitually look to inter the loved one in the graveyard attached to their parish and , like any other piece of land , graveyards were finite ; they could be used to house only so many before they filled up and older tenants had to be moved out . <PARA> sometimes remains were dug up , and sometimes what was left was pushed aside , with the newcomer loaded in on top of whoever was already there . most folks accepted this practice , provided the old bones remained near the church . when bones were disinterred , they were taken to a charnel house , in a process termed second burial . <PARA> english common law states a grave is held only temporarily ( not owned ) and its use terminated “ with the dissolution of the body .” grave inhabitants are granted “ the right of appropriation of the soil to the body interred therein until its remains shall have so mingled with the earth as to have destroyed its identity .” in other words , once you ’ re bones , you ’ ve lost your rights . <PARA> modern cemeteries in many countries routinely rent graves for two to thirty years . at the end of that period , the bones are disinterred and reburied in accordance with that country ’ s cemetery laws . vancouver , british columbia , successfully uses a 30 - year - renewable lease for its graves . in london , england , the wealthy have for many years obtained 99 - year leases on their graves in prestigious cemeteries . ( graves for purchase , though , are scarce .) <PARA> “ they started opening these coffins and found some had scratch marks on the inside . one out of 25 coffins were that way ...” <PARA> scratch marks have been found on the inside of some coffins and tombs , as detailed in our buried alive article . such marks , however , were a relatively rare find , certainly nothing on a level even remotely approaching the “ one out of 25 ” figure presented here . <PARA> “... and they realized they had still been burying people alive . so they thought they would tie a string on their wrist and lead it through the coffin and up through the ground and tie it to a bell . someone would have to sit out in the graveyard all night to listen for the bell .” <PARA> premature burial signaling devices only came into fashion in the 19th century ; they weren ’ t around in the 16th . some of these 19th century coffins blew whistles and raised flags if their inhabitants awoke from their dirt naps . ( once again , our buried alive page provides information about a number of these devices , including ones available in modern times .) <PARA> “ that is how the saying ‘ graveyard shift ’ was made .” <PARA> the earliest documented uses of the phrase “ graveyard shift ” dates from the late 1800s , not the 1500s , and simply references work shifts that took place in the middle of the night and early morning hours , a time of day when work environments could be dark , quiet , and a bit spooky . the similar phrase graveyard watch originated at about the same time and refers to a shipboard watch covering the hours between midnight to 4 am . it ’ s unlikely that sailors aboard ship were in any position to be overseeing the graves of the newly - interred . <PARA> “ if the bell would ring they would know that someone was ‘ saved by the bell ’ or he was a ‘ dead ringer .'” <PARA> “ saved by the bell ” is a late 19th century term from the world of boxing , where a beleaguered fighter being counted out would have his fate delayed by the ringing of the bell to signify the end of the round . need we mention that although fisticuffs were around in the 1500s , the practice of ringing a bell to end a round wasn ’ t ? <PARA> likewise , “ dead ringer ” has nothing to do with the prematurely buried signaling their predicament to those still above ground : the term means an exact double , not someone buried alive . <PARA> “ dead ringer ” was first used in the late 19th century , with “ ringer ” referring to someone ’ s physical double and “ dead ” meaning “ absolute ” ( as in “ dead heat ” and “ dead right ”). a “ ringer ” was a better horse swapped into a race in place of a nag . these horses would have to resemble each other well enough to fool the naked eye , hence the term came to mean an exact double . <PARA> to sum up , though it ’ s entertaining to toy with mental images of cats and dogs falling through thatch roofs and shudder deliciously over the thought of our forebearers dining off wooden platters that had worms waving out of them , that ’ s about as far as one should take this craziness . no matter how many inboxes this popular e - mail has landed in , it never once enlightened anyone . indeed , it probably left more than a few looking like utter fools when they tried to pass this “ knowledge ” along to friends better versed in phrase origins . <PARA> as always , the bottom line is to take such missives with a grain of salt . <PARA> a later version of this piece was prefaced with a putative explanation of origins of the term “ piss poor ,” which we have covered in a separate article .
false	origins : such are the times that it ’ s actually refreshing to see a new horror legend that doesn ’ t involve needles , aids , drugs , gangs or abducted women — just an old - fashioned random serial killer who doesn ’ t need a murder weapon other than his own two <PARA> feet . <PARA> what this legend does share with most others of its ilk is the setting . describing the random , senseless deaths of victims who are killed while at the site of a pleasurable activity ( fishing hole , amusement park , movie theater , dance club , golf club ) is a staple of horror legends . in this case the death is neither an unintentional one caused by an accident or a non - human agent ( such as the recent legend about snakes in ball pits ) or one with a deliberate purpose beyond mere senseless killing ( such as a the gang initation ritual found in the resurgent legend about headlight flashing ). here we have a stranger who kills or maims young women in movie theaters for no apparent reason other than the thrill of it all . <PARA> we know this urban legend - like message must be serious , because it has the hallmarks of the usual important internet warning of a dire and imminent threat to you and your loved ones : a initial statement assuring us that the information presented is true , a description of some horrible crime being perpetrated against innocent victims , and a cautionary closing paragraph typed in capital letters and ending with multiple exclamation points !!! what ’ s not included , of course , are the usual verifiable details : dates , names of cities , names of victims , names of police contacts , etc . <PARA> since the message claims three different occurrences of girls ’ being attacked in movie theaters by someone with the same modus operandi ( but no mention of this being a gang initiation rite ), we can probably assume the crimes are the work of a single man . if so , why he is still on the loose ? at the very least , why don ’ t we have a description of him ? in all three cases only one of a pair of girls was killed or injured ; the other surely saw the monster pull off his crime and described it to someone , or else we wouldn ’ t know the details : that the murderer pretended to be asleep , sat two seats from the aisle , “ woke up ” when the sound check played , “ accidentally ” spilled his drink , and finally deliberately tripped one of the girls to send her hurtling off the balcony . the criminal couldn ’ t have escaped too quickly for anyone to see him , as he would have had to climb over or around at least some theater seats ( and possibly other patrons ) to effect his escape . the theater lights may have been turned down for the beginning of the program , but movie theaters aren ’ t so dark that you couldn ’ t at least observe the height , clothing , and general features of another person standing right in front of you ( and it apparently wasn ’ t too dark to notice that the man deliberately tripped his victims ). so why do we not have the smallest bit of descriptive information about this heinous madman ? <PARA> scarelore warnings like this one , even if they do describe apocryphal events , usually at least offer some valid warnings : keep your eyes on your children at all times , be careful of giving rides to strangers , don ’ t make safety judgments based solely on a person ’ s appearance , etc . but “ be careful in movie theater balconies lest someone push you over the edge ”? if this is a lesson we need reinforced , we ’ re in bigger trouble than i thought .
unproven	a heartwarming story set in an east tennessee hospital in 2016 received international coverage , but without confirmation of key details : <PARA> eric schmitt - matzen ’ s account of an encounter with a 5 - year - old boy was first printed by the knoxville news - sentinel on 12 december 2016 , before it was picked up by usa today . schmitt - matzen himself did interviews with both local and international outlets . <PARA> according to the story by columnist sam venable , schmitt - matzen , a mechanical engineer who moonlights as a part - time santa claus , was contacted by a friend working as a nurse at a local hospital and asked to visit the boy . schmitt - matzen arrived moments before the boy ’ s death , having just enough time to hold him in his final moments . <PARA> venable told us that schmitt - matzen has refused to identify the family , the hospital , or the nurse involved in the story in follow - up interviews . however , schmitt - matzen did backtrack from his initial claim that he reached the facility in 15 minutes , saying instead that it was in east tennessee . <PARA> according to venable , the news - sentinel was still investigating schmitt - matzen ’ s claim , proclaiming : “ certainly , if we are in error on this , we want to be the very first to come out and say — if there is an error — it ’ s on us .” <PARA> we contacted several hospitals in knoxville for comment . both the east tennessee children ’ s hospital and the university of tennessee medical center confirmed that a visit like the one schmitt - matzen described did not occur at their respective facilities . tennova healthcare , which manages several hospitals in the area , told the washington post that it did not take place at any affiliated facility . <PARA> it is unclear whether a scenario like the one schmitt - matzen described constitutes privacy violations for the patient and his family under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 . we contacted both the tennessee department of health and the federal department of health and human services seeking comment . <PARA> on 14 december 2016 , the news - sentinel released a separate story , attributed to venable and editor jack mcelroy , saying they could not verify the story : <PARA> another knoxville news outlet , wbir - tv , posted a story a day later saying that it “ verified several critical details of this story ” while agreeing not to publish them . <PARA> the station ’ s story cited interviews with schmitt - matzen ’ s wife , sharon schmitt - matzen , as well as a friend identified as daniel cunningham . it also cited — but did not quote — text messages sent from eric schmitt - matzen ’ s phone to cunningham and another friend on the night of the alleged visit , which wbir said took place in october 2016 . it does not , however , state whether the station confirmed this account with any healthcare facility . reporter becca habegger told us : <PARA> since schmitt - matzen has reiterated his account of the visit , we cannot say with absolute certainty that it didn ’ t happen — nor do we want to have to say it . he did not respond to a request for comment from us but did tell the post : <PARA> however , it ’ s also impossible to say that it did , because of an apparent lack of vetting of his claims by the multiple media outlets that ran with the story without following up on venable ’ s initial reporting or finding a second source for the claim . <PARA> in this way , this particular santa tale served an instructive purpose : it showed how an unvetted story can spread regardless of how true it might be , with each news outlet repeating it making it seem that much closer to the truth until it is , at last , uncritically reported as fact .
true	on 6 november 2016 , a catholic priest posted a live facebook video in which he placed ( what was said to be ) an aborted fetus upon an altar , urging fellow catholics to vote against democrats and legal abortion . <PARA> a spokeswoman for the catholic clergy activist group , priests for life , confirmed that the fetus was real and was given to the organization by a pathologist under a strict agreement on confidentiality , although she was able to tell us that it was aborted in the second trimester of pregnancy . the group has dubbed the fetus “ baby choice .” <PARA> in the video , fr . pavone has the fetus on an altar , which the spokeswoman said is located in a room that is sometimes used for mass at the organization ’ s headquarters in staten island , new york . the priests for life group originally performed a funeral service for the body , which is preserved in formalin and normally kept in a memorial chapel . on the sunday before the contentious 8 november 2016 presidential election , fr . pavone put it on wider display and urged the religious to vote against legal abortion by ousting democratic lawmakers : <PARA> fr . pavone is no stranger to controversy . in 2014 , new york cardinal timothy dolan cut ties with priests for life , saying the group was stonewalling on financial reforms . on 7 november 2016 , ed mechmann , director of public policy for the archdiocese of new york , slammed fr . pavone and called the video desecration : <PARA> the full video can be viewed below ( graphic image warning ):
true	in early 2020 , we received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of a 10 - month - old article which purported to highlight the left - wing ideology of joseph buttigieg , a prominent academic and the late father of democratic presidential primary contender pete buttigieg . <PARA> the article , published in april 2019 by the right - leaning washington examiner , was later shared on social media at a time when the mayor of south bend , indiana , appeared to perform well in the disputed iowa caucuses , and joined u . s . sen . bernie sanders in leading the polls ahead of the new hampshire primary on feb . 11 . <PARA> the washington examiner piece bore the headline , “ pete buttigieg ’ s father was a marxist professor who lauded the communist manifesto .” the article read : <PARA> in analyzing the political beliefs of academic writers , one must often be careful not to conflate a researcher ’ s focus and dedication to a particular area of study , or to the writings and work of a particular subject , with unambiguous endorsement and support for those writings . ( for example , think of historians who dedicate their careers to studying and writing about the actions of brutal dictators , or criminologists who pore over the lives and appalling offenses of serial killers .) <PARA> likewise , it is common for academics ⁠— especially in the fields of philosophy , literary criticism , and political theory ⁠— to advance or speak highly of a certain argument or piece of writing based on the thoroughness or logical coherence of its arguments , or the novelty of its insights , rather than based purely on whether they “ agree ” with it in a straightforward sense . <PARA> it ’ s also worth noting that pete buttigieg himself has clearly and consistently affirmed his support for capitalism ( although he has emphasized that “ it has to be democratic capitalism ”), so it ’ s not clear what relevance his late father ’ s political ideology has to any discussion around the mayor ’ s presidential campaign . <PARA> with all that in mind , we carefully examined several of joseph buttigieg ’ s published writings , including those cited by the washington examiner . based on those writings and pronouncements , it ’ s clear that he did indeed consistently articulate a broadly marxist worldview , used terminology associated with marxism and with the writings of the marxist italian theorist antonio gramsci , and also professed a fondness for — but also a critical view of — “ the communist manifesto ,” the massively influential text published by karl marx and friedrich engels in 1848 . <PARA> joseph buttigieg moved to the united states from his native malta in the 1970s , ultimately settling in south bend , indiana , where he was the william r . kenan jr . professor of english at the university of notre dame from 1980 until his retirement in 2017 . he died in january 2019 at the age of 71 . he researched the works of the irish novelist james joyce and most prominently , the life and work of antonio gramsci , the early 20th century marxist theorist and co - founder of the italian communist party . <PARA> the elder buttigieg made a significant contribution to the study of gramsci ’ s works with his three - volume english translation of gramsci ’ s “ prison notebooks ” (“ quaderni del carcere ”), and he served for a time as secretary of the international gramsci society . <PARA> gramsci ’ s principal contribution to marxist thought was in his development of the concept of “ cultural hegemony ,” according to which a ruling class exerts and perpetuates the existing power dynamic in a capitalist society by molding social norms , values , and mores in such a way that the oppressed class ( referred to in marxism as the “ proletariat ” and in gramsci ’ s work as the “ subaltern ” class ) adopts those values as if they were fixed and inevitable . in this way , according to the theory , capitalist power structures can perpetuate themselves in a non - violent , orderly manner by manufacturing and manipulating the unspoken and unwitting consent of those who are oppressed by those structures . <PARA> in writing about gramsci , marxism , and concepts related to cultural hegemony , joseph buttigieg often engaged in comparative analysis and close reading of various texts , describing and contrasting the arguments of various contributors , assessing their weaknesses and strengths , and so on . this is typical of academic writing in the field of critical theory and philosophy . however , at times his own personal viewpoint became clear . <PARA> for example , in a 1999 paper on the subject of globalization , colonialism , and the english language , buttigieg described the work of frantz fanon , a post - colonialist political philosopher from the caribbean island of martinique . in his essay , buttigieg first outlined fanon ’ s arguments , quoting heavily from his writings , but then wrote that fanon ’ s arguments “ revealed ” how “ the colonized individual participates in his or her own subordination from the moment in which he or she aspires to acquire the language of the colonizer [...].” <PARA> the use of the word “ reveal ” is crucial , because it signals that joseph buttigieg , in the ensuing passage , is switching modes from merely describing what fanon had written , to offering his own personal viewpoint , which is that fanon ’ s arguments illustrate a certain reality , rather than merely constituting a particular viewpoint . in doing so , the elder buttigieg clearly demonstrates that he himself thinks the teaching of the english language in british colonies is an instance of gramscian cultural hegemony , and articulates his own broader marxist worldview . the passage reads as follows : <PARA> “ fanon ’ s exposition , constructed around a series of vignettes , reveals how the colonized individual participates in his or her own subordination from the moment in which he or she aspires to acquire the language of the colonizer and thus gain access to and appropriate the culture — the worldview — of the colonizer . the efforts of the colonized to gain fluency in the language of the colonial master only reinforce the stranglehold of the colonizer .” <PARA> buttigieg also articulated his own personal viewpoint in a 1995 paper , also published in boundary 2 , a journal of postmodern theory . there , he wrote that gramsci “ could ... perceive ” how “ a dominant class becomes securely entrenched [...].” buttigieg did not write that gramsci “ thought ” or “ claimed ” or “ argued ” that the dominant class in a society perpetuated its power in a particular way . he wrote that gramsci was able to perceive the way in which that happened — meaning that , according to buttigieg ’ s own viewpoint , gramsci had recognized a particular reality , rather than simply making a claim . <PARA> even more clearly than the first example , the ensuing passage demonstrates that joseph buttigieg did not merely study or write about gramsci ’ s strand of marxism — he himself subscribed to it : <PARA> the two citations provided by the washington examiner were also authentic . in 2000 , joseph buttigieg joined with two other authors in publishing a paper which evaluated some of human rights watch ’ s proposals from a marxist perspective , centered around “ the communist manifesto .” one of the premises of that analysis was that human rights advocacy was often reductively legalistic , and failed to properly take into account the local , regional , and global socioeconomic forces that facilitated and perpetuated the kinds of human rights abuses highlighted by groups such as human rights watch — a classic marxist stance . <PARA> in one section of the paper , the authors critically assessed some of the specific recommendations made by human rights watch , drawing a distinction between “ utopian ” proposals and “ fantastic ” solutions to social ills and rights violations , as follows : <PARA> “ although we agree with marx and engels that one should reject fantastic solutions , we believe that it is important to distinguish between a utopian imaginary that is conducive to social change and mere fantasies that are counterproductive . the very creation and promotion of an imaginary that transcends existing practices is essential to movements striving to generate social change . even the discursive production of a utopian future can affect public conceptions and expand the horizon of imagined possibilities . in fact , the marxist project to which we subscribe is based on this kind of utopianism . while most of human rights watch ’ s proposals are also utopian in this constructive sense , at times it offers fantastic recommendations .” [ emphasis is added ]. <PARA> as an example of a counterproductive “ fantastic ” solution , the authors point to human rights watch ’ s proposal that child workers in india be encouraged to form unions . according to the authors , including joseph buttigieg , that proposal fell into the category of a destructive fantasy , rather than a constructive , utopian goal , because it “ lacks contextual sensitivity ” and “ does not take into account the powerlessness and utter vulnerability of these children ,” as well as the violence and retribution to which even adult workers were subjected in response to efforts at organized protest . <PARA> the passage highlights two main points of interest . firstly , it provides yet another demonstration that the elder buttigieg not only wrote about and studied a particular version of the “ marxist project ,” but that he subscribed to it , quite explicitly , as highlighted in the line quoted by the washington examiner . <PARA> secondly , it alludes to the fact that while joseph buttigieg clearly articulated a reverence for “ the communist manifesto ” ( explicitly using it as the cornerstone of the paper ’ s examination of human rights watch ’ s proposals ), he also took a critical approach to it . this was shown at the outset of the paper , where the authors wrote : <PARA> “ while we have chosen to use the manifesto as the point of reference — and as a way of commemorating its recent 150th anniversary — we would like to indicate at the outset that we do not subscribe to a form of marxism that privileges the economic base over the superstructure , nor do we concur with the manifesto ’ s reductionist elements .” <PARA> buttigieg and the other authors were alluding there to a strand in marxist thought which somewhat de - emphasizes the importance of what marx presented as the “ base ” — purely economic forces and power dynamics in society , such as the means of industrial production , relations between employer and employee , and so on — and somewhat emphasizes the importance of what marx presented as the “ superstructure ” — politics , civil society , institutions , and culture . <PARA> this is in keeping with gramsci ’ s shift beyond “ economic determinism ” and his emphasis on the role of culture in perpetuating power dynamics ( cultural hegemony ), and also illustrates his anti - dogmatic vision of marxism , referred to as “ open marxism ” — two key tenets that buttigieg shared . on the subject of gramsci ’ s “ open marxism ,” buttigieg wrote in 1992 : <PARA> “ the antidogmatism of antonio gramsci — so salient a feature of his behavior as a political leader , of his theories , and of his overall approach to intellectual inquiry — is one of the principal reasons why his work continues to attract sympathetic consideration from readers of all political stripes even at a time when marxist thought has been given up for dead .” <PARA> so while it ’ s true , as the washington examiner pointed out , that joseph buttigieg took part in a 1998 event commemorating the 150th anniversary of “ the communist manifesto ,” and clearly regarded that text with a degree of reverence , he also viewed it critically and , like gramsci , explicitly rejected what he presented as its overly - narrow emphasis on the role of purely economic forces in class struggle . <PARA> in the same report on that 1998 event , the elder buttigieg described how live readings from “ the communist manifesto ” were juxtaposed with tony kushner ’ s live reading of his play “ slavs !” which includes a satire of gorbachev - era dogmatic marxists . buttigieg wrote : <PARA> “ after a musical interlude , seven people read different portions of the manifesto . listening to it read , one could not help but be struck by the poignancy of its prose . yet , kushner et al . had implicitly warned even us faithful to guard against conferring upon it the status of scripture , a repository of doctrinal verities .” [ emphasis is added ].
mixture	in april 2006 , the experience of a 14 - year - old who had eaten pancakes made from a mix that had gone moldy was described in the popular newspaper column dear abby . the account has since been circulated widely on the internet as scores of concerned homemakers ponder the safety of the pancake and other baking mixes lurking in their larders : <PARA> there is truth in this tale , yet its inherent warning is overblown . in a nutshell , staledated pancake and other baking mixes pose no danger to you unless : <PARA> how old the mix is has no bearing on its safety — a mix that is well within its freshness date yet has come to contain mold spores could prove fatal to someone with a mold allergy , while one that is a year or two beyond its “ best use by ” date but did not contain mold spores would be perfectly safe . <PARA> while we cannot vet the incident described by “ sue in wyantskill ” involving her 14 - year - old son , the underlying claim is demonstrably true — it is possible for someone who chows down on pancakes made from a mix that has sat around too long to suffer a potentially fatal anaphylactic reaction to the molds that have grown therein . we know this to be so because it has happened before , and the resultant death was documented . <PARA> in 2001 , two pathologists practicing in charleston , south carolina , reported on an unnamed 19 - year - old who died in such a manner . while home on vacation from college , the victim , a young man with a history of allergies ( including mold ), polished off two pancakes made from a packaged mix that had sat open in a kitchen cabinet for about two years — even though his two friends stopped eating their portions , complaining that the griddlecakes tasted like rubbing alcohol . very quickly thereafter , while watching television , the ill - fated collegian experienced shortness of breath that was not relieved by his inhaler . he asked his friends to take him to a clinic not far from the home , and he was reported to have turned a bit blue from lack of oxygen ( i . e ., became cyanotic ) during the ride . while he did manage to walk into the clinic on his own , once inside he suddenly collapsed in cardiopulmonary arrest . he failed to respond to resuscitative efforts and was pronounced dead . <PARA> the cause of his death was determined to be anaphylaxis due to an allergic reaction to molds . <PARA> anaphylaxis is a rapidly developing immunologic reaction that occurs when those who have allergies come in contact with the substances they are allergic to . when it kills , it does so by triggering fatal respiratory or cardiac arrest . <PARA> the pancake mix that delivered a toxic payload was analyzed and found to contain four rather nasty molds : penicillium , fusarium , mucor , and aspergillus . the decedent had not been allergic to eggs ( which are a component of pancakes ), so there was no doubt as to which allergy had killed him . it had been mold , and nothing but . <PARA> there was a death , and it had been due to ancient pancake mix . or , rather , to an allergic reaction to the mold that had grown in the stale pancake mix . <PARA> it needs be kept in mind there is nothing inherently toxic about pancake mix that has passed its freshness date ; the product ’ s aging does not transform it into a poison , nor does the growth of mold within opened boxes of flapjack powder turn it into something that will fell all who ingest it . only those who have allergies to mold are at risk , and even then , for the pancake mix to pose a hazard it has to contain mold spores , not just be over the hill . <PARA> in october 2008 the pancake mix warning was expanded to include cake , biscuit , and brownie mixes . <PARA> unlike what the e - mailed caution would have folks believe , there is nothing magical about yeast which causes it to “ over time develop spores .” <PARA> for mold to gain access to a food product , the foodstuff has to be exposed to its spores . pancake mix cocooned in an unbleached wax paper , plastic , or a foil pouch within its outer packaging wouldn ’ t have this contact and should still be safe no matter how old it gets . however , mix sold unpouched in cardboard boxes or paper sacks would likely be at risk even if the box or sack hadn ’ t previously been opened , because such packaging would not necessarily keep dampness out , and mold thrives in damp environments . <PARA> what does all this mean ? if you don ’ t have a mold allergy , you needn ’ t fear your pancake mix ; if you do have such a sensitivity , you shouldn ’ t keep your flapjack makings around for a few years after opening the box or pouch it came in . it ’ s not worth dying over 50 ¢ worth of pancake mix , so when in doubt , throw it out .
false	examples : [ collected via e - mail , 2006 ] <PARA> origins : in november 2006 , these accounts describing a foiled child abduction at a store in tupelo , mississippi , began arriving in our e - mail . akin to other internet - circulated tales about attempted childnappings at large stores ( such as the venerable canard about kids being pulled in store washrooms to be drugged and have their hair dyed by those attempting to make off with them , or the 2006 hoax about a failed child grab at a blockbuster in north texas ), this one also proved to be a fiction . <PARA> according <PARA> to lee county sheriff jim johnson and tupelo police chief harold chaffin , the story about a mexican woman who initially admired a shopper ’ s baby , then grabbed it from the stroller and ran off with it was pure invention . there hadn ’ t been any such incident — no brave mom who seized the would - be abductor by her long hair and held her until police arrived , no baby - stealing illegal immigrant now behind bars awaiting trial , no ring of kidnappers frequenting tupelo - area stores in search of product for a mexican black market in american infants . <PARA> the mall at barnes crossing , a venue where the alleged foiled abduction was said to have taken place , did succeed in tracing the e - mails to their source . mall manager jeff snyder indicated no legal action was contemplated against the rumor ’ s originator , but he noted that this could well be the last time the mall would be inclined to be so lenient regarding damage done to its reputation . <PARA> the false story spread from inbox to inbox because it invoked not just the specter of the child - abducting stranger ( a frightening enough figure all on its own ) but melded into it a bogeyman of the moment , the illegal immigrant from south of the border . while illegal immigration into the u . s . from mexico has long been a problem , prior to 2006 it was less of a concern to those not living in border states . in 2006 , however , the illegal immigration issue was pushed to the center of the political arena , with some of that pushing taking the form of unsubstantiated rumors positioning all those who come into the u . s . on the sly as violent criminals . the fictive mexican woman of this tale is presented as a kidnapper of small children , and not even one propelled by misguided maternal desire into taking youngsters so she could become their mother , but one motivated purely by avarice , in it for the cash that selling the purloined tots would bring . she is wholly and irredeemably evil and therefore held up as an example of the sort of person a “ look the other way ” attitude towards illegal immigration has allowed into the country . her theft is not merely that of social services , it is of defenseless children ; the cost of having her here is not merely a small increase in taxes paid by the typical family , but the risk that the next tot she or her compatriots snatch will be yours . <PARA> barbara “ bogeyman the barricades ” mikkelson

false	what ’ s true : dorothy bland penned an editorial for the dallas morning news following an interaction with two police officers in her corinth , texas neighborhood . during that interaction , bland was asked for identification by the officers ; she later opined in her editorial that the police stop constituted “ racial profiling ” and officers had engaged with her because of her race . <PARA> what ’ s false : bland lied about the interaction in a manner later contradicted by police dash cam video footage . <PARA> origins : on 28 october 2015 the dallas morning news published an op - ed piece credited to dorothy bland , dean of the frank w . and sue mayborn school of journalism at the university of north texas , in which she claimed she had been stopped and questioned by police for “ walking while black ”: <PARA> in the editorial , bland wrote that “[ f ] lashing lights and sirens from a police vehicle interrupted a routine saturday morning walk in my golf - course community in corinth ,” continuing her account of the traffic stop by stating : <PARA> although bland described the incident as “ racial profiling ,” the content of the editorial she wrote fell into two categories . one was subjective : whether or not one believed bland was stopped based on her race hinged solely on individual interpretation . the other was incident - specific : bland claimed she was asked for photo identification shortly after she encountered the two officers in the video . whether bland “ fabricated ” any portion of her description of the interaction was largely answered by dash cam video of the stop later released by police in corinth , texas , and appended to her article : <PARA> the clip depicted officers following bland for roughly 30 seconds in a patrol car , though there were no audible sirens in the footage . the police cruiser came to a stop , and bland ( several yards away ) turned and walked to meet the approaching officers . ( how she was specifically summoned was unclear as she was facing away from the vehicle at the time ). at around the 50 - second mark of the dash cam video , the officers began speaking to bland and informed her that she had been observed obstructing traffic , whereupon bland thanked the officers for their concern . at the 1 : 27 mark , the officer on the left asked if bland “[ had her ] id on [ her ] real quick ”; bland immediately bristled at the request before pointing the officers to adjacent neighbors who might vouch for her . <PARA> one officer then produced a pad and pen or pencil and requested bland ’ s name and date of birth for “ the call ,” reiterating that the stop was out of concern for her safety . at that juncture , bland consented but insisted on taking a photograph of the two officers with her phone ( additionally taking a photograph of the cruiser ’ s tags ). still detained , bland made conversation with one officer while the other radioed in her name , date of birth , and description (“ black female ”). finally , the two officers and bland parted cordially , shaking hands . <PARA> in a statement appended to bland ’ s editorial , corinth police chief debra walthall maintained that the request for identification was routine in stops relating to obstruction of traffic . ( a 4 november 2015 editorial published by the dallas morning news clarified bland ’ s editorial and walthall ’ s response were published simultaneously , and the headline was edited a few hours later .) no separate video of bland obstructing traffic was released by the department , nor was she visibly obstructing traffic during the period recorded by dash cam footage . walthall didn ’ t explain why bland ’ s name , date of birth , or description was radioed in by the officer : <PARA> a subsequent editorial published in the dallas morning news ( not written by bland ) described the video as a “ rorschach ” test , positing that the content was perceived in a variety of ways depending upon the viewer : <PARA> controversy over bland ’ s article spread on social media , including calls for her to be fired from her position at the university of north texas . she later stated that the op - ed column reflected her opinion and experience : <PARA> dorothy bland described the interaction as an instance of “ racial profiling ” in a controversial dallas morning news editorial on 28 october 2015 . whether or not bland was indeed profiled remains a subjective , opinion - based assessment . bland clearly believed the encounter was at least in part motivated by her race and the relative affluence of the neighborhood in which she was stopped . <PARA> factually , bland was stopped during an early - morning walk by corinth police ( as described in her column ). her description of “ sirens ” was questionable , as none were heard during the dash cam clip . by the same token , no evidence presented by the corinth police department definitively indicated bland was obstructing traffic at the time of the stop ( or shortly beforehand ). <PARA> as bland stated , police did abruptly request identification during an otherwise benign interaction . her narrative didn ’ t include the portion where that information was conveyed to dispatch as she waited ( a detail later revealed by the video ), neither did she speculate about what would have happened had her name or description warranted further questioning . no portion of bland ’ s editorial demanded or even insinuated the police ought to have been disciplined over the interaction , nor was any aspect of it ( aside from “ sirens ”) something that could reasonably be construed as a fabrication . <PARA> originally published : 3 november 2015
false	origins : many <PARA> negative superstitions attach to flowers that are brought by wellwishers to cheer up the sickly . the blossoming out of season of a tree or plant is widely regarded as an ill omen , possibly even a portent of death , so offerings that come from such a plant are to be eschewed . another floral death omen asserts bringing white <PARA> blooms in a home will speed the demise of one living there . especially to be avoided are white flowers that have drooping heads ( for obvious reasons : the <PARA> sagging head of the flower presages the lolling head of the one about to be fatally overcome ) and those that are heavily scented ( because the souls of the departed were at one time believed to be resident in such blooms ). <PARA> in england there exists a strong aversion to having in hospitals bouquets in which red and white flowers have been mixed . such a combination , it is said , will bring on the death of someone on the ward where the flowers are taken , but not necessarily the demise of the recipient of the cursed nosegay . red flowers are usually considered lucky , their scarlet hue reminiscent of blood and thereby symbolizing life , so this is a departure from the expected — normally , scarlet or crimson blooms would be greeted with approval . however , the combination of red and white , it is said , signifies blood and bandages and is therefore to be shunned . we are told florists will balk at or even refuse to make up such bunches if they know they ’ re intended for hospital <PARA> patients and that some ward sisters will forbid such floral arrangements on their floors . “ my mother , then a nurse , was told off by the ward matron in the forties for putting a patient ’ s red and white flowers in the same vase ,” said one british woman to the daily mail . <PARA> flowers brought to a patient should never be laid upon the ailing person ’ s bed . also , it is said when the ill or injured person recovers enough to go home , he must <PARA> leave all his sickroom bouquets and potted plants behind lest he himself be back there shortly . <PARA> however , the greatest superstition attaching to flowers and sickrooms has to do with the floral offerings ’ purported ill effects upon the air in enclosed spaces . it is widely and erroneously believed flowers ( cut or growing in pots ) will suck up the oxygen in a sickroom , thereby depriving the invalid of needed sustenance . our earliest print sighting of this belief dates to 1923 , but the belief itself is clearly older . <PARA> flowers do not deplete sickrooms of their life - giving oxygen . quite the opposite , in fact : while plants do use oxygen at night , they give off ten times as much during the day , which means their presence enriches the air rather than impoverishes it . as for any residual misgivings about leaving a sick person overnight in a room with plants that are siphoning some of the oxygen from that space , consider this : in an hour , a pound of plant leaves uses about 0 . 1 liters of oxygen , whereas a 150 - pound person resting quietly uses more than 71 liters of the gas . <PARA> ergo , the nurse who enters the room a few times a night to check on the patient uses far more of that space ’ s oxygen than does a whole floral array . <PARA> barbara “ the night nurse takes our breath away ” mikkelson

unproven	origins : one of the ways paperhangers were supposedly able to pass bad checks easily once upon a time was by manipulating the american bankers association ( aba ) numbers encoded on nearly all checks with magnetic ink . although the american banking system relies heavily upon this information for the automated sorting and routing of checks , many bank personnel are unfamiliar with or pay little attention to these numbers . <PARA> the system has changed a little bit over the years , but nowadays checks typically bear a nine - digit aba routing number printed in the bottom left - hand corner ( indicated as # 5 in the above diagram ). in general , the first four digits are a federal reserve routing symbol , <PARA> identifying which of the twelve federal reserve districts the check was printed in ( and a city within that district ). the next four digits are an aba institution identifier which designates the bank on which the check is drawn , and the last number is a check digit . <PARA> check forgers manipulated the banking system by altering the aba routing numbers on the bad checks they passed so that the numbers identified different banks than the ones whose information was printed on the face of those checks . for example , a forger attempting to pass a bad check in boston might present a check whose printed information indicated it was drawn on a philadelphia bank , but whose <PARA> routing number had been altered to indicate that it came from a bank in the 12th federal reserve district ( which encompasses the western united states ). the boston bank would expect a check drawn on a philadelphia bank to clear within two or three days and assume that if it hadn ’ t been kicked back to them by the end of the third day , it was good . however , the altered routing number would cause the automated sorting machinery to send the check on to a san francisco clearing house for processing . once the check arrived in san francisco , a computer there would kick it out because the routing number didn ’ t match the other information encoded on the check , and the check would be mailed back to the philadelphia bank for processing . this whole process could take several days , but because the boston bank assumed the check was good after the third day , the forger could withdraw his funds and leave town long before they discovered his check was phony . <PARA> con man frank abagnale ( of catch me if you can fame ) claims in his memoirs that he “ was the first check swindler to use the routing numbers racket ” in the late 1960s . one of thomas whiteside ’ s 1977 new yorker articles included an example of what supposedly happened when a forger altered checks drawn on the chemical bank in new york so that their routing numbers identified them as coming from a los angeles bank : <PARA> although the check bore the name and address of the chemical bank in new york , the federal reserve data - processing system scanned only the magnetic - ink code on it , identified it as a bank of america check , and routed it to los angeles . the check remained in transit for perhaps two days . at the end of that time , it was run through the computer mechanism at the bank of america . the computer , instantly searching its memory for a bank of america account number matching that of the magnetic - ink strip on the check , rejected the check , which then went into a clerical pool for manual handling . since the printed logotype on the check clearly identified it as a check that belonged in the chemical bank in new york , the clerk handling the machine - rejected check sent it back to the chemical bank by mail , assuming that a simple routing error had been made . the check was then in transit for another two days . back at the chemical bank , the check was put into the computerized sorting system for final clearance . but instead of that , it went into motion again : the chemical bank computing system passed it on to the federal reserve system , which routed it out to the los angeles bank again , which routinely sent it back to new york , and so on . <PARA> the fraud was uncovered only when checks issued by the depositor became so frayed from mechanical handling in the computer system that they could no longer be read automatically ...

true	we received multiple inquiries from readers in october 2019 about the accuracy of various reports claiming that a colorado man who supported the rights of undocumented immigrants , and railed against u . s . president donald trump ’ s immigration policies , had himself been killed by an undocumented immigrant . <PARA> on aug . 9 , the website pluralist published an article with the headline “ man who slammed trump for ‘ racist ’ immigration policies killed by illegal immigrant .” the article reported that : <PARA> “ a man who criticized president donald trump ’ s immigration policies in the name of progressive christianity was killed last week by an undocumented immigrant who avoided deportation by hiding in a local ‘ sanctuary church .’ sean buchanan , a father of five from colorado springs , was driving his motorcycle on highway 83 when miguel ramirez valiente [ sic ] swerved into his lane and killed him . the immigrant was charged with reckless driving with a revoked license .” <PARA> similar versions of the story were subsequently published by several other websites . initial media reports named the accused immigrant as “ miguel ramirez valiente ,” but according to court records we obtained , his name is “ miguel ramirez - vallente .” <PARA> many of those posts appeared to suggest a certain irony at work in the story , and some online commenters reacted with glee and gratification to the circumstances surrounding buchanan ’ s death . others saw fit to post political arguments against immigration on a tribute page set up by the company that oversaw buchanan ’ s funeral service . <PARA> notwithstanding the commentary that has surrounded buchanan ’ s death , the reports in question did present an accurate account of some key facts but arguably rushed to judgement in describing one person involved in the fatal collision as having “ killed ” the other . <PARA> buchanan did , on at least few occasions , express strong criticism of trump and his policies , in particular the policy of separating undocumented immigrants from their children after they are caught and detained at the southern border of the united states . <PARA> the man who drove the other vehicle in the collision that killed buchanan , miguel ramirez - vallente , was indeed an undocumented immigrant from el salvador . according to colorado law enforcement , ramirez - vallente was responsible for the crash , but as of october 2019 , he had not been convicted on any charge , although he was charged with careless driving leading to buchanan ’ s death . as of october 2019 , it is premature to state definitively , as so many reports did , that he “ killed ” buchanan . <PARA> buchanan ’ s views on trump , immigration <PARA> buchanan ’ s facebook page does not show any publicly visible posts relating to politics or immigration , and his twitter account has been set to “ protected ,” meaning only approved followers may view what he had posted . however , archived links to some of his tweets show that he did , on at least a few occasions , express strong criticism of trump and his immigration policies , in particular . <PARA> in september 2018 , the actor and left - leaning activist george takei tweeted a criticism of the trump administration ’ s policy of detaining immigrant children in cramped conditions at border detention centers , separate from their parents and guardians . he wrote : <PARA> “ the question for us is not just ‘ how did this happen ?’ it is also ‘ have we learned ?’ america failed my family and community when it locked us inside camps for years . have we learned ? i ask because detention camps hold over ten thousand kids . today . america : have we learned ? <PARA> buchanan responded by writing : <PARA> “ i used to think that # racism and ignorance on this scale would just die off with older generations , but as [ george takei ] points out – it continues to be handed down . # notdone # resist # freethekids .” <PARA> based on the context , and the nature of the tweet to which he was responding , it is reasonable to conclude that buchanan was characterizing the trump administration ’ s border detention policy as being informed by racism and ignorance . <PARA> in july 2018 , buchanan tweeted out a recommendation of a 2016 new york magazine article that likened trump ’ s success in that year ’ s republican presidential primary to the rise of hitler in 1930s germany . although buchanan remarked only “ interesting read ,” the article was clearly unflattering towards trump , and buchanan ’ s recommendation of it provides further evidence ( albeit not definitive proof ) of his negative view of the president . <PARA> in november 2015 , buchanan encouraged his twitter followers to speak out against congressional efforts to limit immigration from syria , writing : “ urgent : congress voting on a bill that will close our borders to syrian # refugees tomorrow ! tell them no .” <PARA> that tweet did not mention trump , but it provides further proof that buchanan clearly held views on immigration that were radically opposed to those promoted by the president . <PARA> buchanan ’ s death <PARA> according to an account given to abc 7 by buchanan ’ s wife , kathy , the couple and their children were in the process of moving from their house in colorado springs to a new home in castle rock , and buchanan was set to start a new job in denver . <PARA> on aug . 2 , they arranged to drive to the new house together , but buchanan decided at the last minute to take his motorcycle , meet his wife at the house , drop off the motorcycle , and then drive back to colorado springs together in their car . the crash that killed him took place that morning along highway 83 . abc 7 reported that : <PARA> “[ colorado state patrol ] says miguel ramirez valiente [ sic ] went off the side of the road on hwy 83 , over - corrected into the opposite lane and hit sean buchanan . valiente [ sic ] pleaded guilty to dui in 2018 . he was charged with careless driving with a revoked license for the crash that took buchanan ’ s life .” <PARA> a spokesperson for the immigration and customs enforcement agency ( ice ) later told abc 7 that ramirez - vallente was an undocumented immigrant from el salvador who had been taken into ice custody . abc 7 reported that : <PARA> although the colorado state patrol has indicated ramirez - vallente was responsible for the collision that killed buchanan , and despite his history of dangerous driving , he has not yet been convicted of causing buchanan ’ s death . <PARA> prosecutors in douglas county , colorado , have charged him with “ driving under restraint ” ( for driving with a revoked license ) and “ careless driving resulting in death .” a pre - trial conference was scheduled to take place on oct . 29 , 2019 . <PARA> as such , we cannot yet definitively support the claim , made in many of the articles cited above , that buchanan was “ killed by ” ramirez - vallente . if that set of circumstances changes , we will update this fact check accordingly .

false	origins : the <PARA> “ haiku error message ” list is another example of a concept which began purely as a bit of creative fun , but has since been stripped of the context explaining its origins and is now proffered as a “ true ” piece of information . <PARA> this list has probably spread so widely not just as a humor piece but as a “ real ” article because the world of computers is still a deep , dark mystery to many ( lots of people use pcs regularly but have no idea how the machines work , and they therefore believe just about any computer - related information coming from a seemingly authoritative source ), and because the list so neatly plays into the western view of the japanese as a poetic and fatalistic people . <PARA> the haiku list was the work of many creative minds , but they were mostly american minds , and the entries were intended simply to bring about a few chuckles . the clever messages were prompted by a january 1998 contest in salon magazine , which challenged readers to come up with inventive error messages written as haiku poems : <PARA> the world of high - tech has been called soulless — a charge that is borne out by on - screen error messages like “ abort / retry / fail ?” and “ 404 — file not found .” below , a modest attempt at change — an error message in the form of a haiku poem : <PARA> something you entered <PARA> transcended parameters . <PARA> so much is unknown . <PARA> readers are invited to submit up to three error messages written as haiku poems . the haiku is a three - line poem in the 5 / 7 / 5 form ( first line 5 syllables , second line 7 , third line 5 ). <PARA> something you entered <PARA> transcended parameters . <PARA> so much is unknown . <PARA> readers are invited to submit up to three error messages written as haiku poems . the haiku is a three - line poem in the 5 / 7 / 5 form ( first line 5 syllables , second line 7 , third line 5 ). <PARA> salon ultimately received over 200 entries , from which they selected two winners and thirty other efforts worthy of honorable mention . the list now circulating is drawn largely from those entries as published by salon , although different versions drop some of the original items and include entries from other sources .
mixture	recipe for a salacious , titillating rumor : <PARA> this was the fare cooked up on the joan rivers show on 4 may 1990 , when angela bowie took advantage of the recent expiration of a ten - year gag order ( imposed as a condition of the divorce agreement that ended her 1970 - 80 marriage to rock star david bowie ) to spill some dirt on her famous ex - husband . <PARA> in a nutshell , what happened was rivers promised her audience that her guest was “ ready to dish — and i mean down and dirty dishing — about her ex .” angela bowie reportedly got cold feet and maintained that she didn ’ t like “ kissing and telling ,” whereupon she was “ led off camera and subjected to some scornful denunciation of her cowardice from rivers and another guest , shock - humor radio personality howard stern .” <PARA> after rethinking her position , angela returned to the set and discussed her stormy marriage to rock ’ s “ thin white duke ,” claiming : “ i caught him in bed with men several times . in fact the best time i caught him in bed was with mick jagger ” ( when she walked into her bedroom after returning from a trip ). when howard stern prodded her by asking if the two men had their clothes off , she answered , “ they certainly did .” <PARA> although the former mrs . bowie did not say when the incident occurred or offer any further details ( other than to note that her reaction to the sight of her husband in bed with another man was to go and make breakfast ), the implications of her tattle were clear . david bowie had long since openly acknowledged his bisexuality , and although mick jagger had not made any such revelation ( and had certainly bedded a bevy of women ), rumor had it that the rolling stone wasn ’ t averse to taking a turn with another man once in a while — and perhaps had with a bandmate or two . <PARA> two men of variable sexual persuasion in bed together , both naked ? — that could only mean one thing . buddies returning from a night of carousing might drop into the same bed to sleep it off . they might even strip down to their underclothing . but to lie in bed together naked ? ho ho , they obviously must have had something more than sleep on their minds . <PARA> but was any of this true ? mick jagger was quick to dismiss the whole thing as “ complete rubbish ,” and a public letter from david bowie ’ s lawyer stated that any “ implication that there was ever a gay affair between mick jagger and david bowie is an absolute fabrication .” sure enough , within a week angela bowie was backtracking , claiming that although what she had revealed was literally true , it didn ’ t necessarily mean what people assumed it meant . on a may 11 geraldo appearance she clarified : “ i certainly didn ’ t catch anyone in the act . all i found were two people sleeping in my bed . they happened to be naked and they happened to be mick jagger and david bowie and it ’ s not a big deal . it doesn ’ t mean necessarily that it ’ s some sort of affair .” several months later she was already dismissing the gossip as “ old news ” and claiming that the two men were only “ passed out in bed .” <PARA> nonetheless , since denials aren ’ t nearly as fascinating as rumors , the tale that “ the head stone was also sleeping with [ angela ’ s ] husband ” spread far and wide . angela then muddied the issue ever further with her 1993 tell - all book backstage passes , in which she disingenuously chided the public for assuming what she had obviously intended to imply , while nonetheless admitting that she herself still believed what everyone else had assumed : <PARA> david bowie ’ s response to the matter ( as reported in us magazine in 1995 ) was succinct : <PARA> the friendship between david bowie and mick jagger ( and angela bowie ’ s suggestion that it may have been more than a “ friendship ”) led to several retroactive rumors concerning whom mick jagger was singing about in the rolling stones ’ 1973 # 1 hit “ angie ,” a bittersweet ( and presumably autobiographical ) ballad about the end of an unsatisfying love affair . ( part of the speculation may have been fueled by angela bowie ’ s statement on the joan rivers show that when she when returned from a trip to find her husband and mick jagger in her bed , she thought that “ they were composing ‘ angie .'”) <PARA> when a musician composes a song about an unhappy love affair with a woman ’ s name for a title , many of us assume it must have been inspired by a real - life romance with someone of that name ( especially if it turns out he knew a girl called that , no matter who she was in his life ). yet this is often not the case ; songwriters routinely pen works where names and details are chosen because they fit the meter of the composition . although the song itself could be the catharsis of deeply - felt personal angst expressed as a specific ( yet completely fictional ) outpouring , or could be an actual chronicle of a hurtful experience endured , it does not necessarily follow that the gal who stirred up those feelings in real life would be given the same name in the song . autobiography only goes so far — if the meter is not right , the name goes . <PARA> songwriters also have composed pieces built around specific names merely because they liked the sound of them : buddy holly did know a “ peggy sue ” ( the girlfriend of drummer jerry allison ), but the song wasn ’ t based on any real - life romance between her and buddy . sometimes musicians just write for their audiences , churning out works that expound upon common experiences their music - buying public will identify with ( such as heartwrenching partings ). for such offerings , the eponymous girl does not have to be anyone real , because the writer is calling upon universal themes for the substance of his song . <PARA> was “ angie ” about any one person , or was the name just plucked from the air ? we don ’ t know . but we do know enough about music not to immediately conclude that a song titled with a girl ’ s name means the writer had an unhappy experience with a girl of that name . <PARA> yet speculation over the identity of the “ angie ” of rolling stone fame has long past ceased to be an active topic , a quieting of wagging tongues that has yet to take place with the original rumor , that of mick jagger and david bowie having sexual knowledge of each other . failed love affairs as expressed in song lyrics only hold interest for so long , but a salacious rumor about famous people engaging in a homosexual coupling will live as long as there are people to repeat it .
false	in may 2017 , a fantastical image showing the sun and moon between two trees appeared on social media alongside an even more fantastical claim : <PARA> both the image and the accompanying claim are fake . it was originally created by bess hamiti and has been online since at least november 2012 , when he published it to his facebook page with a simple one - word message : “ sunset .” we reached out to hamiti to find out how he created the picture ; it appears that it was created by adding a moon to a genuine photograph of a sun setting between two trees . <PARA> hamiti ’ s image ( right ) and the base photograph ( left ) which was uploaded by “ bessi ” to wikipedia in september 2012 appear to bear out that theory : <PARA> the claim about the photographer ’ s technique is spoofing some of the extraordinary measures taken by photographers in order to capture their images . for example ,, photographer alan mcfadyen said that he took over 700 , 000 images over the course of 6 years to capture a shot of a kingfisher ’ s beak piercing the surface of a body of water . also , a nearly verbatim copy of the claim shared with the photograph of the sun and moon between two trees was also made about footage showing a large cat swiping at a bird : <PARA> although we have not verified the claim about the cat video , it makes more sense when applied to this footage than the tree photograph . the cat is a moving creature that could attack prey at any time or place , meaning that a photographer might need multiple cameras and patience in order to capture a good image . the sun and the moon , on the other hand , are not prone to quick or impromptu movements . <PARA> last but not least : this scene is scientifically impossible to photograph . although the moon and sun can be spotted in the sky together at the same time , a full moon only occurs when the moon is exactly opposite the sun : <PARA> in other words , as every night sky photographer knows , the full moon only rises at sunset and sets at sunrise .
true	presidential challenge coins , tokens typically given out by u . s . presidents as personal mementos to military members they meet , got a trumpian makeover in late 2017 . the once - subtle coins now feature the president ’ s campaign slogan (“ make america great again ”) and bear trump ’ s name in three in places ( in contrast with tokens from past administrations , on which previous presidents ’ names appeared just once each ). <PARA> past versions of the coins have been imprinted with the slogan “ e pluribus unum ” (“ out of many , one ”), were composed of silver and copper , and bore the u . s . presidential seal . the new version replaces that seal with an eagle bearing trump ’ s signature , and does away with the latin phrase that is part of the great seal of the united states . <PARA> the republican national committee will fund the manufacture of the coins , which are not issued by the u . s . mint or used as currency , but rather are souvenir keepsakes . <PARA> according to the washington post , ethics experts have expressed concern about the decision to include a campaign slogan on the coins . trevor potter , a republican and a former chairman of the federal election commission , told the post that : <PARA> challenge coins make valuable collector ’ s items , with some selling on ebay for hundreds of dollars each .
false	if someone has access to the spare remote at your home , call them on your cell phone ( or borrow one from someone if the cell phone is locked in the car too !) <PARA> hold your ( or anyone ’ s ) cell phone about a foot from your car door and have the other person at your home press the unlock button , holding it near the phone . <PARA> your car will unlock . and it works . saves someone from having to drive your keys to you . distance is no object . you could be hundreds of miles away , and if you can reach someone who has the other “ remote ” for your car , you can unlock the doors ( or the trunk , or have the “ horn ” signal go off , or whatever !) <PARA> origins : most <PARA> new cars now come equipped with “ remote keyless entry ” ( or “ keyless remote ” or “ keyless entry ” or “ remote entry ”) systems ( also known as rke systems ), a mechanism which allows automobile owners to lock and unlock their car doors remotely ( from up to about 300 feet away ) by <PARA> pressing buttons on transmitting devices small enough to be carried on keychains . rke systems are handy for a number of reasons : they enable drivers to unlock car doors without having to fumble around for keys ( a great advantage in darkness , during inclement weather , and when one ’ s hands are full ), they enable car owners to give someone else access to their vehicles without having to hand over ignition keys , and they provide a means by which motorists can open their cars to retrieve keys that have been locked inside . <PARA> but what if you accidentally lock your remote entry device in your car along with your keys ? ( a plausible scenario , as many people carry them together on the same keyring .) if you own a car equipped with a system such as onstar you can contact an operator and have onstar unlock your vehicle remotely through a signal sent via a cellular network , but otherwise you have to call a locksmith or get a friend or relative to bring an extra set of keys out to you . <PARA> enter the idea of the poor man ’ s onstar . no need to pay for a fancy car - unlocking service : just use a cell phone to call someone who has access <PARA> to your spare rke device and tell him to point it at the phone and press the “ unlock ” button . you simultaneously point the cell phone at your car door , and voila — you ’ re in ! a nifty solution ... at least it would be if it weren ’ t implausible for most standard remote entry systems . <PARA> relaying remote entry system signals via telephone might work if the signals were sound - based , but they ’ re not . an rke system transmits an encrypted data stream to a receiver inside the automobile via an rf ( radio frequency ) signal , a signal that can ’ t be effectively relayed via cell phone . ( in any event , rke systems and cell phones typically operate on completely different frequencies ; the former in the 300 mhz range and the latter in the 800 mhz range .) <PARA> ( more than a few people have inadvertently fooled themselves into believing the cell phone method of unlocking car doors actually works because they tried it and achieved the desired results — not realizing their cars were still within range of their keyless remote devices , and the signals that unlocked the doors were transmitted the usual way [ i . e ., through the air ], not via cellular phone connections .) <PARA> it ’ s possible this method might work with cars that use something different than standard rke systems , but it doesn ’ t work with the vast majority of models . <PARA> as an owner of a vehicle equipped with an rke system , i ’ ve found that it has reduced the likelihood of my locking my keys in the car in an unexpected way : since i quickly became accustomed to always locking and unlocking the car with the rke device , and i carry the rke device on the same ring as my keys , i have to be standing outside the vehicle with my keys in my hand in order to lock it . now if i only had something to keep me from losing my cell phone . . .
false	in 1950 , a new york city police officer who was working missing - persons cases examined the body of an approximately 30 - year - old man that was brought into the morgue . the man had shown up in the middle of times square at 11 : 15 p . m . that evening , “ gawking and looking around at the cars and up at the signs like he ’ d never seen them before ,” then was quickly hit and killed by cab when he tried to cross a street against the traffic lights . <PARA> the pockets of the deceased ’ s clothing held multiple pieces of coinage and currency of forms that had not been produced for several decades , yet many of them were in mint condition . his possessions also included items from types of businesses that no longer existed in new york city ( i . e ., a bill from a livery stable and a brass slug from a saloon ), a letter postmarked in 1876 , and cards bearing the name rudolph fentz with an address on fifth avenue . <PARA> further investigations turned up no listings for a “ rudolph fentz ” in new york city phone directories ; the fifth avenue address listed on the dead man ’ s cards had been a business rather than a residence for many years , and no one there had heard of rudolph fentz ; the deceased ’ s fingerprints matched none on file ; and no current missing - persons reports or inquiries fit the details of the body in the morgue . moreover , the dead man ’ s clothes appeared to be about 75 years out of date in style , his apparel bore tags with the name and address of a tailor whom no one had ever heard of , and his hat bore a tag from a store that had gone out of business many years earlier . <PARA> the investigating officer finally turned up a listing in an old phone directory for a “ rudolph fentz , jr .,” a man in his sixties who had passed away five years earlier . his widow had since moved to florida , but by mail she supplied the information that her husband ’ s father , rudolph fentz , had disappeared sometime in the 1870s , having gone out for a walk around 10 : 00 p . m . one evening and never returned . a search of the missing - persons file for 1876 turned up a report for a “ rudolph fentz ,” whose clothing and address corresponded to those of the man killed in times square in 1950 . <PARA> this ostensible report from nypd capt . hubert v . rihm about the unexplained disappearance — and inexplicable reappearance 74 years later — of what appeared to be rudolph fentz has been reproduced in various forms since the 1970s as one of the many tales that seemingly confirms the existence of time travel . yet it is not a true account at all , but rather an excerpt from a short story titled “ i ’ m scared ,” which was penned by science fiction writer jack finney ( whose best known work was the novel “ the body snatchers ”) and published in collier ’ s magazine in 1951 . <PARA> in that story , the narrator is puzzled when he catches a broadcast of a radio program that had gone off the air several years earlier . he then tracks a series of unusual events that are indicative of temporal disturbances : a man received a telephone call from his sister that she insisted she hadn ’ t made until three days later ; a bank discovered that a check had been deposited the day before it was written ; a letter mailed from wyoming was delivered to a new york city address just seventeen minutes later ; and a man was shot and killed by a gun that police had found and impounded the previous day . the narrative involving capt . rihm and the reappearance of fentz was the longest and most detailed vignette offered in “ i ’ m scared ” as evidence of the narrator ’ s discovery of rifts in time occurring all around new york city . <PARA> the cause of those temporal disturbances — and the message of “ i ’ m scared ” — was explicated in the story ’ s closing paragraphs :

false	following the umpqua community college shooting in october 2015 , an undated article on the web site beliefnet titled “ harvard university study reveals astonishing link between firearms , crime and gun control ” attracted significant traction on social media . the article ( split up across six pages ) didn ’ t lead with the name of the study it referenced , and without ever once linking to the document on which it was based , it maintained : <PARA> while identifying details were curiously absent on the five pages that followed , it was clear the “ study ” in question was an item titled “ would banning firearms reduce murder and suicide ?” originally published in the harvard journal of law & public policy ( volume 30 , number 2 ) [ pdf ]. <PARA> of primary importance is the subsequent , widely misapplied label of the word “ study ” with reference to the 2007 item in question . the harvard journal of law & public policy describes itself as “ one of the most widely circulated student - edited law reviews and the nation ’ s leading forum for conservative and libertarian legal scholarship .” papers published in that journal are ( while perhaps competitively sourced ) in no way equivalent to peer - reviewed research published in a credible science - related journals as “ studies .” use of the term “ study ” to refer that 2007 article dishonestly suggested that the assertions made by its authors were gathered and vetted under more rigorous study conditions , which didn ’ t appear to be the case . <PARA> the paper was credited to authors don b . kates and gary mauser . a profile for kates ( a gun rights enthusiast [ pdf ]) describes him as “[ one of the ] foremost litigators , criminologists and scholars on the second amendment and the fundamental right to self - defense and the individual right to keep and bear arms in the country .” kates was prominently featured in a march 2013 washington post article about gun lobby efforts to infiltrate law review publications , and mauser ’ s web site biography reads : <PARA> in a document dated june 2009 [ pdf ], director of the harvard injury control research center dr . david hemenway addressed the 2007 article ’ s flaws in correlating higher rates of gun ownership with lower crime rates thusly : <PARA> incidentally , hemenway is named as a researcher on a 2007 social science and medicine study titled “ state - level homicide victimization rates in the us in relation to survey measures of household firearm ownership , 2001 – 2003 .” that research ( carried out by researchers at the harvard injury control research center ) found : <PARA> hemenway ’ s 2009 writing pointed to weak points in the 2007 paper , such as a highly misleading excerpt that misrepresented two then - recent public health and policy studies . immediately following a citation of kates ’ own prior work ( his 1979 book restricting handguns : the liberal skeptics speak out ), the authors posited that two large government - backed studies had failed to conclude gun control measures affected crime rates : <PARA> the first referenced item , firearms and violence : a critical review ( 2004 ), pointed to a lack of sufficient data with respect to gun policy ( not a failure to conclude that gun control reduced crime ): <PARA> similarly , the actual wording of the centers for disease control ( cdc )’ s cited report more explicitly conflicted with the authors ’ assertions that a conclusion had been drawn : <PARA> in short , the purported 2007 harvard “ study ” with “ astonishing ” findings was in fact a polemic paper penned by two well - known gun rights activists . its findings were neither peer - reviewed nor subject to academic scrutiny of any sort prior to its appearance , and the publication that carried it was a self - identified ideology - based editorial outlet edited by harvard students . the paper disingenuously misrepresented extant research to draw its conclusions , and researchers at harvard ( among which kates and mauser were not included ) later objected to the paper ’ s being framed as a “ study ” from harvard ( rather than a law review paper ). the paper wasn ’ t “ virtually unpublicized research ” ( as beliefnet claimed ); rather , it was simply not deemed noteworthy at the time it was published due to the fact it was neither a study nor much more than a jointly - written editorial piece representing its authors ’ unsupported opinions .

false	we all admire the wunderkind — that rare person of remarkable talent and ability who achieves great success or acclaim at an early age . prodigies usually reach legendary status through their extraordinary accomplishments alone , but the occasional wunderkind - in - a - hurry helps his nascent legend along with a little fanciful embroidery . such is the case with film director steven spielberg , who began garnishing his past with a bit of fantasy even from the earliest days of his professional career . <PARA> spielberg ’ s first practical exposure to the workings of hollywood studios came in the summers just before and after he graduated from high school in the mid - 1960s , when he apprenticed at universal studios as an unpaid assistant in the studio ’ s television department . over the subsequent years , those humble beginnings morphed into a more and more elaborate tale told by spielberg about how he had supposedly sneaked into universal dressed in business attire , commandeered an empty bungalow , and set up shop on the premises for over two years before someone finally discovered didn ’ t actually belong there : <PARA> by 1985 , spielberg had added the detail that he first made his way onto the universal lot by sneaking off the tram during a public studio tour : <PARA> so much for the legend . in fact , steven spielberg ’ s entree to the universal lot was gained while he was a 16 - year - old on break from his junior year of high school in arizona ( in late 1963 or early 1964 ), and it had nothing to do with his sneaking onto the premises — his visit was arranged in advance by his father ( through an intermediary ) with chuck silvers , assistant to the editorial supervisor for universal tv , as silvers recalled to spielberg biographer joseph mcbride : <PARA> after spielberg returned to arizona , he kept up an occasional correspondence with chuck silvers and returned to universal during the summer of 1964 to work as an unpaid clerical assistant . it was then that one of the few details from spielberg ’ s imaginative account of his early days at universal studios actually played out — according to chuck silvers , young steven did have to use his ingenuity to get onto the lot each day : “ the first time he came back there i got him a pass to come on the lot . i couldn ’ t get him a permanent pass on the lot . steven found his own way of getting on the lot . steven was able to walk onto the lot just about any time he damned well pleased .” <PARA> but both silvers and his co - worker divulged to biographer mcbride that the tale about spielberg ’ s finding and occupying an empty office at universal was a bit of creative fiction on the fledgling director ’ s part to romanticize his early background : <PARA> even though spielberg embroidered the reality of his first few summers at universal , he certainly did make the most of his experience . at the tender age of 22 he directed joan crawford in the pilot episode of rod serling ’ s night gallery for universal television , and by the age of 30 he had helmed two of the top - grossing films of all time , jaws and close encounters of the third kind — just a small part of a stellar cinematic career that also included box office favorites raiders of the lost ark , e . t . the extra - terrestrial , and the academy award - winning schindler ’ s list ( the latter of which nabbed top honors in 1993 in seven categories , including best picture and best director ). <PARA> embellishment is part of the magic that is hollywood . or , as comedian george burns was wont to say about the tall tales woven into the fabric of his own life : “ most of what i say is true . the rest is show business .”

unproven	what ’ s true : some doctors have claimed that medical ( not surgical ) abortions can be halted or “ reversed ” through a new procedure . <PARA> what ’ s false / undetermined : that the referenced procedure is safe and works as described , or that a demand for such a procedure exists to any meaningful degree . <PARA> origins : on 4 november 2015 oakside christian school radio station woak published an article titled “ doctor develops ‘ emergency abortion pill reversal kit ,'” relaying information about a doctor ’ s development of an “ abortion pill reversal kit ” that has “ reversed the abortions of more than 100 women ”: <PARA> similar information was reported by the conservative christian pro - life web site lifesitenews a few days later : <PARA> irrespective of one ’ s religious , moral , or political beliefs about abortion , these articles should have raised concern due to their presentation of an alarming amount of potentially dangerous and misleading medical information without any reference to extant scientific literature . moreover , the details presented were shaky : the number of abortions potentially disrupted ( or “ reversed ”) to date via the purported therapy jumped from 70 to 137 between the two articles , and neither site qualified how such claims were substantiated . <PARA> claims that medical abortion procedures might be “ reversible ” aren ’ t new : large web sites previously reported on them in late 2014 and early 2015 . a 2012 study published in the annals of pharmacotherapy ( titled “ progesterone use to reverse the effects of mifepristone ”) involving a handful of subjects was the only reference to this form of procedure we found in medical literature , and it described a half - dozen possible attempts at “ abortion reversal ” ( of which two - thirds were possibly successful ): <PARA> as the above - reproduced excerpt indicates , the 2012 article documented a study of just six patients , mentioned that no previously published trials or case studies had been conducted in this area , and did not indicate how much demand there was ( or might be ) for the described procedure beyond a non - specific reference to “ some women ” <PARA> a september 2015 study published in the journal contraception approached “ abortion reversal ” from a clinical perspective , identifying a host of flaws in the concept and its execution . following a “ systematic review of the literature on the effectiveness of medical abortion ‘ reversal ’ treatment ,” researchers found that evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of the procedure was worryingly scant : <PARA> as that study noted , the initial study on which the claims rested was of “ poor quality ” and involved incomplete data . but most telling was the final sentence : “ abortion reversal ” procedure success rates hinged on low initial doses of mifepristone and stage of pregnancy ( and coincidentally , those factors are also linked with intervention - free failures of medical abortion ). study author dr . daniel grossman explained to slate that : <PARA> the atlantic reiterated the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists [ acog ]’ s stance on the procedure , underscoring that it presented false hope to patients considering abortion while maintaining an easily - explained illusion of efficacy ( commonly known as “ confirmation bias “: <PARA> in an undated statement [ pdf ], the acog similarly cautioned : <PARA> although multiple web sites carried news reports about “ abortion reversal ” procedures , that information was apparently published without additional corroboration of its claims . medical literature on the concept of “ abortion reversal ” indicates that the procedure carries a success rate similar to that of “ doing nothing and waiting ,” and its outcome hinges solely ( or largely ) on the initial dose of medication and gestational age ( factors that are independent of attempts to interrupt a pregnancy termination ). the intervention also carries “ significant cardiovascular , nervous system , and endocrine adverse reactions ,” risks not associated with the likely equally effective course of “ doing nothing .” <PARA> from any perspective , the claims made about “ abortion pill reversals ” seem inherently dangerous . the procedure appears unlikely to prevent medical abortions from proceeding to completion , and the issue addressed by “ abortion reversal ” is one probably better handled via thorough counseling prior to abortions rather than through a risky and unproven medical procedure that is seemingly no more effective than doing nothing at all . <PARA> originally published : 9 november 2015

( independents are at the mercy of a very volatile oil market and operate on thin profit margins , and even a single day ’ s disruption of supply or demand can wipe out many days ’ worth of hard - earned profits .) as such , the “ gas out ” is a punch on the nose delivered to the wrong person . <PARA> either apathy or an outbreak of common sense has made previous “ gas outs ” non - events with very low levels of participation , as documented by these snippets of news accounts from across north america : <PARA> friday ’ s gasoline boycott was an effort that sputtered , coughed , then died . motorists continued to fill up gas - guzzling sport - utility vehicles and trucks alongside smaller vehicles despite a one - day protest aimed to pressure oil companies to lower gas prices . <PARA> <PARA> although a gasoline boycott that began as an electronic mail campaign kept some drivers nationwide away from the pump , dealers say they saw little , if any , effect on their traffic . <PARA> <PARA> in seattle , there were so many cars waiting to get into [ a ] texaco station ... yesterday afternoon that it caused a backup five cars deep into [ the ] right - hand lane . <PARA> <PARA> reports indicated few motorists paid attention to a nationwide boycott touted initially by internet e - mail and later by word of mouth . <PARA> <PARA> a planned nationwide boycott protesting the high price of gasoline didn ’ t have much effect on local gas stations . <PARA> <PARA> “ we were expecting something substantial ,” said mark johnson , the owner of a chevron station . “ we haven ’ t really noticed much of a difference .” <PARA> <PARA> irving stations in sunny halifax said the boycott had no effect on business . <PARA> “ it ’ s been busy as a bugger here ,” said bruce riley , manager of one station . “ we haven ’ t been busier in the last two weeks ,” added the manager at another halifax outlet . <PARA> <PARA> gas stations [ in ottawa ] reported “ busier than ever ” conditions at the pumps on the day of the great internet gas - out . <PARA> although a gasoline boycott that began as an electronic mail campaign kept some drivers nationwide away from the pump , dealers say they saw little , if any , effect on their traffic . <PARA> in seattle , there were so many cars waiting to get into [ a ] texaco station ... yesterday afternoon that it caused a backup five cars deep into [ the ] right - hand lane . <PARA> reports indicated few motorists paid attention to a nationwide boycott touted initially by internet e - mail and later by word of mouth . <PARA> a planned nationwide boycott protesting the high price of gasoline didn ’ t have much effect on local gas stations . <PARA> “ we were expecting something substantial ,” said mark johnson , the owner of a chevron station . “ we haven ’ t really noticed much of a difference .” <PARA> irving stations in sunny halifax said the boycott had no effect on business . <PARA> “ it ’ s been busy as a bugger here ,” said bruce riley , manager of one station . “ we haven ’ t been busier in the last two weeks ,” added the manager at another halifax outlet . <PARA> gas stations [ in ottawa ] reported “ busier than ever ” conditions at the pumps on the day of the great internet gas - out . <PARA> gasoline is a fungible , global commodity , its price subject to the ordinary forces of supply and demand . no amount of consumer gimmickry and showmanship will lower its price in the long run ; only a significant , ongoing reduction in demand will accomplish that goal . unfortunately , for many people achieving that goal would mean cutting down on their driving or opting for less desirable economy cars over less fuel - efficient models , solutions they find unappealing . <PARA> an event like a “ gas out ” can sometimes do some good by calling attention to a cause and sending a message . in this case , though , the only message being sent is : “ we consumers are so desperate for gasoline that we can ’ t even do without it for a few days to demonstrate our dissatisfaction with its cost .” what supplier is going to respond to a message like that by lowering its prices ? those who really want to send a “ message ” to oil suppliers should try not buying any gasoline for several months in a row . <PARA> other articles about gasoline prices :

( according to associated press , which reported that none of betsy and rick devos ’ four children attended public schools .) <PARA> does not believe in or support public education ? <PARA> mixture . based on her statements , devos advocates on behalf of “ school choice ,” meaning she believes all families should have access to more educational options than just public schools . that doesn ’ t , on the face of it , preclude support for public education , though devos ’ critics would argue that redirecting public monies to private schools via vouchers or other schemes is tantamount to defunding the public school system . according to a devos family spokesperson interviewed by the detroit news , members of the family have “ given millions of dollars ” to the grand rapids public schools over the years . <PARA> believes that public school teachers are overpaid ? <PARA> undetermined . we haven ’ t unearthed any public statements by her to that effect , although a conservative think tank with which her family is aligned has expressed that view . <PARA> supports for - profit education ? <PARA> true . at least , insofar as devos favors the proliferation of charter schools , some of which are organized as for - profit businesses . <PARA> invested $ 200 million in christian schools and organizations ? <PARA> undetermined . through their nonprofit organization , the dick and betsy devos family foundation , betsy and her husband have given tens of millions of dollars to a great many schools and organizations , some of which are identified as “ christian .” for 12 years running , for example , the foundation donated between $ 200 , 000 and $ 300 , 000 annually to potter ’ s house , a nonprofit “ christ - centered ” elementary school serving underprivileged children in grand rapids , michigan . but they have also contributed large amounts to the van andel institute ( vai ), scientific research and education facility , and the john f . kennedy center for the performing arts , among many others . <PARA> doggedly advocates funneling money out of public education and into for - profit , christian - based education ? <PARA> partly true . as noted above , devos has long been an advocate for “ school choice ,” which does involve , to some extent , funneling money away from public schools and toward private educational options , including for - profit and christian - based schools . <PARA> on 7 february 2017 , the senate approved betsy devos as secretary of education , with vice president mike pence breaking a tie vote .

mixture	on 27 july 2016 , the web site endingthefed . com published an article headlined “ obama cuts military pay for 3rd year in a row ,” reporting that president obama had been responsible for “ deterring ” a pay raise for the military while simultaneously seeking to increase the federal minimum wage “ for illegal aliens ” to $ 15 per hour : <PARA> while there ’ s a grain of truth to what ’ s stated above , the headline under which it was published was quite misleading , and parts of the article text were completely false . <PARA> u . s . military personnel actually received an overall pay increase each year between 2014 and 2016 , although it was fairly small ( 1 % to 1 . 3 %) and less than than it would have been had president obama not exercised his authority to override the standard formula for military pay raises written into u . s . code . <PARA> the formula ties fluctuations in military pay to the national employment cost index ( eci ), a measure of private sector labor costs , to prevent military wages from lagging behind civilian pay . however , that same law empowers the president ( with the approval of congress ) to raise or lower a prescribed military pay raise on the grounds of extenuating economic circumstances . for the years 2014 , 2015 and 2016 , president obama did , in fact , cap those amounts as follows : <PARA> eci increase obama budget <PARA> ——————————————————————- <PARA> 2014 + 2 . 3 % + 1 . 0 % <PARA> 2015 + 1 . 8 % + 1 . 0 % <PARA> 2016 + 2 . 3 % + 1 . 3 % <PARA> the obama administration ’ s 2017 budget calls for a 1 . 6 % increase in military pay . <PARA> as to the claim that the capped pay increase for 2016 resulted in a wage of less than $ 3 per hour for grade e - 4 military personnel , that figure would appear to based on a 24 - hour - a - day , seven - day work week . we see the logic in that , especially in regard to service men and women on combat duty , but it ’ s probably not the most cogent way to compare military and non - military compensation . according to militaryrates . com , a service member with less than three years ’ experience and a pay grade of e - 4 earned a base wage of $ 2 , 150 . 51 per month in 2016 , or roughly $ 538 per week , plus non - taxable food and housing allowances , health care coverage and special and incentive payments based on their specific qualifications and duties . the median average wage for all americans , most recently calculated by the social security administration in 2014 , was approximately $ 555 per week . no matter how it ’ s measured , the gap between military and non - military pay has unquestionably widened in recent years . <PARA> as to the claim that president obama called for “ illegal aliens working at mcdonald ’ s ” to earn a minimum wage of $ 15 per hour , that is false . some politicians ( such as senator bernie sanders of vermont ) have called for a raise in the national minimum wage to that level , but not president obama . in his 2015 state of the union address , the president called upon congress to raise the national minimum wage from $ 7 . 25 to at least $ 10 . 10 per hour .
true	in february 2020 , social media users posted about an infamous 164 - year - old episode in the history of the u . s . congress — the caning of sen . charles sumner . the incident was highlighted in the aftermath of president donald trump ’ s 2020 state of the union address and house speaker nancy pelosi ’ s much - discussed ripping up of her copy of the president ’ s speech . <PARA> on feb . 4 , 2020 , shortly after the state of the union , right - leaning journalist ian miles cheong posted a short clip of pelosi tearing a copy of the speech , describing it as “ the most classless act ever conducted in congress .” <PARA> several users countered this assertion by pointing to an 1856 incident in which the pro - slavery u . s . rep . preston brooks “ beat a senator nearly to death ” on the floor of the u . s . senate : <PARA> on facebook , some users also highlighted the brooks - sumner affair as a riposte to claims that pelosi ’ s speech - ripping was unprecedentedly aggressive . <PARA> the claim that in 1856 a congressman ( brooks ) viciously attacked a senator ( sumner ) with a cane on the floor of the u . s . senate was accurate and is a matter of historical record . <PARA> here ’ s how the website of the u . s . senate describes the infamous attack : <PARA> the attack provoked a storm of controversy , press coverage , and a senate investigation . it was immortalized in several prints , including the one shown below , which was produced by john henry bufford and shows brooks to the right brandishing his cane over the head of an unsuspecting sumner , with brooks ’ fellow south carolina congressman laurence keitt keeping would - be defenders of sumner at bay : <PARA> according to the findings of that investigation , brooks was unrepentant about his assault on sumner , reportedly saying : <PARA> “ today i approached [ sumner ], after the senate adjourned , and said to him , ‘ mr . sumner , i have read your speech carefully , and with as much calmness as i could be expected to read such a speech . you have libelled my state [ south carolina ] and slandered my relation [ andrew butler ], who is aged and absent , and i feel it to be my duty to punish you for it .’ and with that i struck him a blow across the head with my cane , and repeated it until i was satisfied [...].” sumner ’ s “ crime against kansas ” speech can be read in full here . <PARA> the house failed to garner the necessary two - thirds vote to expel brooks , but it successfully censured keitt . according to the house ’ s website , both men resigned in protest at what they perceived to be unfair treatment by their congressional colleagues , and they subsequently won back their seats in the special elections triggered by their resignations . brooks died just months later in january 1857 . <PARA> for his part , sumner was so badly injured in the beating that he took three years to recover , but he went on to serve in the senate until his death in 1874 .
false	a video uploaded to youtube on 1 october 2017 asserted that the mighty mississippi river was “ going dry ,” and that its diminishing water level was attributable to a crack in the ground that had opened up near the new madrid fault : <PARA> the video touched on a variety of topics in its eight - and - a - half minute runtime , but its overall premise was stated in the description provided by its uploader , mrmbb333 : “ has a crack formed in the bottom of the mississippi river leaking water down into the new madrid fault ? the mighty mississippi is getting very low , even bone dry in some places . no drought .... where is the water going ?” <PARA> despite using images of dry river beds , screenshots of a map from the united states geological survey ( usgs ), and testimonials from anonymous sources , the video maker ’ s claim that the mississippi river is “ going dry ” is unsupported by any hydrologic data . such an occurrence would involve an anomalous loss of water , which would be documentable via a variety of scientifically rigorous methods . <PARA> the obvious approach would be to look at water levels from areas near the mississippi river and close to the new madrid fault and see if the current levels there are lower than usual when compared with historical data , and this is the approach usgs research statistician david smith took when we asked him about the “ going dry ” claim . as an example , he pulled up historical data from a well in the the town of caruthersville , missouri , which lies directly over the new madrid fault and adjacent to the mississippi river . its levels were normal ( if not higher than average ) for this time of year , smith told us : <PARA> smith also took umbrage at the video maker ’ s claim that there has been no drought in the area that could be responsible for differing water levels . this , too , he told us , is false : <PARA> john schumacher , the supervisory hydrologist at the usgs - missouri water science center , took another approach to the problem . schumacher compared the river ’ s flow both upstream and downstream of the new madrid fault and found no evidence of a “ mystery ” lost flow : <PARA> in the video , the narrator makes the claim that the opening of the new madrid fault ( which does not show up in hydrologic data ) could perhaps be attributed to the devastating earthquakes that struck mexico in late 2017 : <PARA> although the seismologists whom we spoke with were not comfortable using absolute terms such as “ impossible ,” they were skeptical that the mexico quakes would have had much effect on conditions along the new madrid fault 1 , 200 miles away . william newman , a professor of seismology at ucla , told us that “ how much stress from the mexican event can increase the likelihood or probability of rupture near the new madrid fault is very difficult to ascertain , but is likely very small .” <PARA> regardless of seismological explanations ( or lack thereof ), claims that the mississippi river is losing an anomalous amount of water through some unexplained process are false . the river ’ s water is where scientists expect it to be , in normal quantities .
true	origins : in june 2007 the boston globe reported that in 1983 , current republican presidential hopeful ( and former massachusetts governor ) mitt romney had placed his irish setter in a dog carrier on the roof of his station wagon for a 12 - hour trip to his parents ’ cottage on the canadian shores of <PARA> lake huron . he ’ d built a windshield for the carrier to make the ride more comfortable for the dog . he ’ d also made it clear to his five sons that bathroom breaks would be taken only during predetermined stops to gas up the car . <PARA> the dog spoiled this plan by letting loose with a bout of diarrhea during its rooftop sojourn , necessitating an unplanned gas station visit for the purpose of hosing down the pooch , its carrier , and the back of the car . <PARA> in that boston globe article , the incident was pointed to as an example of romney ’ s emotion - free crisis management style . others viewed it differently , regarding the mode of canine transport the dog was subjected to as unnecessarily callous and cruel . <PARA> romney dismisses such critics by saying “ they ’ re not happy that my dog loves fresh air .”
false	origins : much of the developing lore concerning the september 11 terrorist attacks on the usa incorporates the idea that those who planned them signalled them in advance ( intentionally or inadvertently ), but the signals went unrecognized until after the event . one such rumor has it that several internet domain names related to the events of september 11 were registered well before that dark day , demonstrating that whoever registered them had foreknowledge of the attacks ( and was therefore not only complicit in the plot , but possessed of a callous desire to profit from its aftermath ). <PARA> cnsnews . com , for example , reported that at least 17 different now - expired domain names related to the world trade center attack were registered up to 15 months before september 11 , such as : <PARA> attackamerica . com <PARA> attackonamerica . com <PARA> attackontwintowers . com <PARA> august11horror . com <PARA> august11terror . com <PARA> horrorinamerica . com <PARA> horrorinnewyork . com <PARA> nycterroriststrike . com <PARA> pearlharborinmanhattan . com <PARA> terrorattack2001 . com <PARA> towerofhorror . com <PARA> tradetowerstrike . com <PARA> worldtradecenter929 . com <PARA> worldtradecenterbombs . com <PARA> worldtradetowerattack . com <PARA> worldtradetowerstrike . com <PARA> wterroristattack2001 . com <PARA> note , however , that none of these domain names is specific to the events of september 11 — they include a number of permutations using terms such as attack , horror , terrorists and terrorism , and new york and the world trade center , but none of them is undeniably connected to the september 11 terrorist attacks . given the prominence of new york , the prevalence of violence and horror in our popular entertainment , the millions of domain names registered over the years , and the fact that the world trade center had already been attacked back in 1993 , that a handful of expired domain names used one or more of these elements should be no surprise . the couple of domain names on this list that reference the year 2001 do not include a date and make no mention of new york or the world trade center ; the few that include a date do not specify a year , do not refer to september 11 , and make no mention of new york or the world trade center . this is a nothing story , promulgated by those looking for something sensational to write about . <PARA> two things did happen immediately after the morning of september 11 : <PARA> in the former case , many auction sites cancelled the listings ; in the latter case , many registrars declined to process the registrations and rescinded those that slipped through the cracks . other internet auction and domain registration outfits allowed the transactions to proceed , however : <PARA> while verisign decided to ban some names , register . com ’ s afternic won ’ t . “ our view is that freedom of expression is unfortunately a freedom to offend ,” said michael tippett , general manager for afternic . “ to react to this situation by restricting freedom of expression would be playing into the hands of people attacking that freedom .” <PARA> of course , not everyone who obtained disaster - related domain names was seeking to exploit the horrific events for personal gain . many of the registered names have been used for sites which offer tributes to victims and rescue workers , provide information about resources for victims and survivors , aim to help with relief efforts , or collect poetry , pictures and songs . some domains were even deliberately registered by people seeking to keep them out of the hands those who might use them to exploit the tragedy . speculators who sought to register related domain names purely for commercial gain may have overestimated their worth : <PARA> elliot noss , chief executive of name registration company tucows inc ., said speculators of attack - related names are misguided about their value . unlike movies or companies , he said , relief efforts and tributes are generic enough that a determined organization can find a new name for $ 30 . his advice to speculators : “ take your $ 30 and donate it .” <PARA> additional information :
unproven	origins : energy certainly has been on people ’ s minds lately , what with higher gasoline prices and soaring power costs in states such as california , and the bush administration ’ s response — denunciation of the 1997 kyoto global - warming agreement , a willingness to allow oil exploration in the alaska national wildlife refuge , renewed interest in “ dirty ” fossil fuels such as coal — has left many environmentally - inclined folks disappointed . but is the proposed symbolic blackout really a protest directed at changing governmental policy , or merely a means of finding a scapegoat to blame for our own lack of <PARA> responsibility ? <PARA> nobody seemed to be complaining about a lack of emphasis on “ efficiency , conservation , and alternative fuels ” when energy prices remained satisfactorily low . now , prices are higher ( for a variety of reasons ), the word “ energy ” is more frequently coupled with the word “ crisis ,” and the whole issue is suddenly the government ’ s fault . whether we agree with the white house ’ s handling of energy policy or not , we need not wait for official government “ emphasis ” or approval to implement efficiency and conservation at a local level . fuel - efficient automobiles are there for the buying , as are energy - saving light bulbs and power - saving appliances . how many of us took advantage of them before rising prices forced us to change our energy - wasting ways ? we could easily save more oil through personal conservation efforts than is to be found in the entirety of the alaska national wildlife refuge . <PARA> as protests go , the planned blackout is a pretty good one : it harms no one , it makes a symbolic point in a very visible way , and it may better acquaint participants with how dependent upon electricity the average household is . but , as usual , if the only effort we make to affect energy policy is to turn off our lights for three hours one day and then resume our normal habits , we shouldn ’ t expect much to change . “ rolling your own blackout ” offers the average citizen a constructive way of venting , but we suspect far too many people will end up “ participating ” in it by watching television or surfing the web in darkened rooms , then hopping into their suvs to go get something to eat . <PARA> barbara “ lancelot versus the black night ” mikkelson <PARA> sightings : “ tonight show ” host jay leno rolled his own blackout by taping his june 21 2001 show using minimal lighting .
false	in april 2015 , the web site em toast published a humorous ( and fictional ) article reporting that the fda had banned the sale of grape - flavored ice cream in the u . s . due to pet related hazards : <PARA> the em toast article was only initially shared a few hundreds times on social media , but an imgur post based off the information contained in this fictional article went viral on 13 april 2015 . while neither the imgur post nor the em toast article included a disclaimer to indicate that the claim concerning an fda ban on grape ice cream was false , several clues pointed to the article ’ s fictional nature . <PARA> first , the original article was published in the “ short fiction ” section of em toast . second , although the em toast web site did not include a statement specifically declaring its humorous intent , its “ about ” page simply stated that “ we write what we want , when we want .” finally , grape - flavored ice cream is available at several ice cream parlors around the united states . handel ’ s homemade ice cream and yogurt , for instance , currently sells grape ice cream . <PARA> the em toast spoof was based on the notion that the consumption of grapes and raisins has been linked to renal failure in dogs , although it is highly unlikely that phenomenon would ever lead to a ban on grape - flavored human treats by the fda . dogs are also problematic consumers of common ingredients such as chocolate , avocados , raisins , and macadamia nuts .

true	“ bottle bombs ” ( also commonly known as “ drano bombs ” or “ works bombs ”) are not a new phenomenon ; they ’ ve been a favorite of youthful pranksters for decades , as their construction requires only a few ordinary , commonly available components : plastic soda bottles , aluminum foil , and drano ( or other brand of household drain or toilet cleaner ): <PARA> in general , one need simply push some aluminum foil balls into a plastic bottle , add some drano , and screw the cap tightly onto the bottle . the combination of the hydrogen chloride or sodium hydroxide in the fluid and the aluminum foil creates a strong chemical reaction which releases hydrogen gas ; when that gas builds up to sufficient pressure , it ruptures the side of the plastic bottle , releasing the contents in an explosive burst : <PARA> although the force of pressure - based bottle bombs may seem small when compared to other types of explosives ( such as gunpowder - based ones ), any form of explosive has the potential to cause serious injury , and since bottle bombs have no conventional fuse they can be dangerously unpredictable , exploding earlier or later than their wielders expect . ( aluminum foil is typically coated with a layer of wax , so it can take up to ten minutes or so for the fluid to strip away the wax and react with the aluminum foil , enhancing the chances that a soon - to - explode bottle bomb may be picked up by an unwary passer - by .) additionally , the caustic cleaning agents used in bottle bombs can cause severe burns when they come into contact with skin ( either through spillage in the construction of the bombs or through being sprayed widely in the resulting explosions ) and produce toxic fumes . <PARA> the above - quoted e - mail warning about neighborhood residents discovering undetonated bottle bombs in their yards was sent out by washtenaw county sheriff ’ s deputy keith mansell in april 2010 after he discovered two drano bombs left in the yards of residents of york township , michigan . for the most part , those who concoct bottle bombs mix the ingredients , immediately set their work aside , and stand back to watch it explode within a minute or two . however , there are ways of delaying the mixture and / or reaction of the ingredients so as to cause a delayed detonation , so those who discover objects that appear to be bottle bombs should refrain from handling them and contact authorities for removal . <PARA> at about the same time as deputy mansell ’ s warning hit the internet , the town of methuen , massachusetts , experienced a rash of similar plastic - bottle bomb placements , including two that blew apart mailboxes : <PARA> some more cases of bottle bomb discoveries include one such item found on an oregon elementary school playground on 18 february 2013 : <PARA> a woman residing in wichita , kansas , called police on 16 february 2013 after someone detonated bottle bombs nearby : <PARA> also in february 2013 , police in beavercreek , ohio , warned residents about a recent rash of bottle bomb incidents in the community :

false	a purported missive from renowned physicist albert einstein to his daughter about the power of love has reappeared in our inbox multiple times over the years : <PARA> lieserl einstein is one of the great mysteries connected with the life of her father , the famed physicist albert einstein . her very existence was completely unknown to biographers until 1986 , when a batch of letters between einstein and his first wife , mileva maríc , were discovered by einstein ’ s granddaughter evelyn ( ultimately published in the 1992 book the love letters ). <PARA> those letters revealed a child named lieserl was born to einstein and maríc in january 1902 , a year before the couple married , in what is now the country of serbia . mileva cared for the child for a time while einstein was away working in switzerland , then joined him in that country without bringing lieserl along . after that , aside from a few scattered mentions of her preserved in einstein ’ s early 20th century letters , there are very few clues about lieserl ’ s life or her fate . she was never referenced in any of einstein ’ s preserved correspondence after 19 september 1903 , when he expressed concern about her having scarlet fever . <PARA> other than those few tantalizing clues , whatever happened to lieserl remains a matter far more of speculation than of fact . in her 1999 book einstein ’ s daughter : the search for lieserl , author michele zackheim combed through the available evidence and reached the conclusion that lieserl was born with a severe mental handicap and died of the scarlet fever her father had referenced in a 1903 letter ( when lieserl was but 21 months old ). robert schulmann of the einstein papers project advanced the theory that lieserl ( who was blind from childhood ) was adopted by helene savíc , a close friend of mileva ’ s , and lived into her 90s under the name zorka savíc . ( milan popovíc , helene ’ s grandson , refuted this claim in his 2003 book in albert ’ s shadow : the life and letters of mileva maríc , einstein ’ s first wife , stating that he also believed lieserl died of scarlet fever in 1903 .) <PARA> in any case , it ’ s simply not possible that lieserl einstein “ donated 1 , 400 letters written by albert einstein to the hebrew university in 1980s ,” as nobody knows whether lieserl even survived her infancy . and there isn ’ t a single preserved letter from albert einstein to lieserl herself , as the physicist didn ’ t so much as mention her in his correspondence after 1903 , when she was less than two years old . ( someone seems to have confused lieserl einstein , albert einstein ’ s little known daughter , with evelyn einstein , the adopted daughter of albert einstein ’ s oldest son , hans albert einstein .) so the purported letter from albert einstein reproduced above in which the scientist described love as a “ universal force ” certainly does not stem from the any correspondence with his daughter lieserl . <PARA> is it possible that is a genuine letter from albert einstein to someone other than lieserl ? probably not , given that : <PARA> this appears to be another case of someone ’ s trying to get readers to pay attention to words by attributing them to a well - known , respected figure whom the public views as knowledgeable in the subject matter at hand . and who could possibly know more about god and love and other “ universal forces ” than the most renowned scientific genius of our time ?

mixture	examples : [ collected via e - mail , october 2014 ] <PARA> origins : on 28 may 2014 , houston mayor annise parker signed the controversial houston equal rights ordinance ( hero ) into law . the houston chronicle described the ordinance thusly : <PARA> the measure bans discrimination based not just on sexual orientation and gender identity but also , as federal laws do , sex , race , color , ethnicity , national origin , age , religion , disability , pregnancy and genetic information , as well as family , marital or military status . <PARA> the ordinance applies to businesses that serve the public , private employers , housing , city employment and city contracting . religious institutions would be exempt . violators could be fined up to $ 5 , 000 . <PARA> the ordinance applies to businesses that serve the public , private employers , housing , city employment and city contracting . religious institutions would be exempt . violators could be fined up to $ 5 , 000 . <PARA> after the passage of hero , opponents of the ordinance began to collect signatures to put a repeal measure on the ballot . on 3 july 2014 <PARA> hero opponents delivered more than 50 , 000 signatures to the city of houston , but a month later the city announced proponents of the repeal were “ 2 , 000 valid signatures short of the 17 , 269 - signature threshold ” and that “ most of the pages contained mistakes that invalidated the entire page of signatures .” <PARA> on 7 august 2014 , hero was placed on hold after opponents of the ordinance filed suit against the city with the help of the alliance defending freedom , a conservative christian legal advocacy group focused largely on opposing same - sex marriage and abortion . the following month city attorneys subpoenaed sermons given by local pastors who oppose the law and are tied to the conservative christian activists who have sued the city . <PARA> as eugene volokh , a professor at the ucla school of law , wrote in his “ volokh conspiracy ” blog of the underlying issue : <PARA> opponents of the equal rights ordinance are hoping to force a repeal referendum when they get their day in court in january , claiming city attorney david feldman wrongly determined they had not gathered enough valid signatures to qualify for the ballot . city attorneys issued subpoenas during the case ’ s discovery phase , seeking , among other communications , “ all speeches , presentations , or sermons related to hero , the petition , mayor annise parker , homosexuality , or gender identity prepared by , delivered by , revised by , or approved by you or in your possession .” <PARA> critics have contended that the subpoenas are an infringement on religious liberties , that they are intended to “ punish and intimidate those who dared to step - up and oppose the city council ,” and that the specific and seemingly unrelated nature of the subpoenaed material suggests the discovery investigation is really about a crackdown on political or anti - homosexual preaching in city churches . houston city officials maintain the subpoenas are about determining the validity of the petitions seeking the recall of hero and the manner in which signatures for them were gathered : <PARA> the issue centers around a subpoena sent to some pastors actively involved in collecting petition signatures against houston ’ s non - discrimination ordinance . the subpoena asked the religious leaders to turn over “ all speeches , presentations , or sermons related to hero , the petition , mayor annise parker , homosexuality , or gender identity prepared by , delivered by , revised by , or approved by you or in your possession .” <PARA> pastors claim it ’ s an overly broad fishing expedition . “ the city council and its attorneys are engaging in an inquisition designed to stifle any critique of its actions ,” said a rep for the alliance defending freedom , a conservative legal firm . “ political and social commentary is not a crime ; it is protected by the first amendment .” <PARA> but their complaints make it sound like the pastors are about to be tried for hate speech using the new law , which is far from the case . <PARA> [ city attorneys ] were looking into what instructions pastors gave out to those collecting signatures for a referendum on the non - discrimination law . ( what exactly the pastors said , and what the collectors knew about the rules , is one of the key issues in pending litigation around whether opponents of the law gathered enough signatures for a referendum .) <PARA> feldman said the pastors made their sermons relevant to the case by using the pulpit to do political organizing . that included encouraging congregation members to sign petitions and help gather signatures for equal rights ordinance foes , who largely take issue with the rights extended to gay and transgender residents . <PARA> “ there ’ s no question , the wording was overly broad . but i also think there was some deliberate misinterpretation on the other side ,” [ houston mayor annise ] parker said at a press conference . “ the goal is to find out if there were specific instructions given on how the petitions should be accurately filled out . it ’ s not about , ‘ what did you preach on last sunday ?'” <PARA> to reiterate : the mayor ’ s office is not interested in what they preached , or how the pastors feel about parker or her sexual orientation . ( those things are all well protected under the first amendment , as they should be .) all officials want to know is what kinds of instructions the pastors gave out with respect to collecting petition signatures , and whether what they said agrees with what they ’ re arguing in court while appealing the referendum . <PARA> pastors claim it ’ s an overly broad fishing expedition . “ the city council and its attorneys are engaging in an inquisition designed to stifle any critique of its actions ,” said a rep for the alliance defending freedom , a conservative legal firm . “ political and social commentary is not a crime ; it is protected by the first amendment .” <PARA> but their complaints make it sound like the pastors are about to be tried for hate speech using the new law , which is far from the case . <PARA> [ city attorneys ] were looking into what instructions pastors gave out to those collecting signatures for a referendum on the non - discrimination law .

exempt status for engaging in political activities , but rather to prove that pastors involved in the repeal referendum “ knew the city ’ s rigorous charter rules but failed to follow them ”: <PARA> for the churches , the issue of whether those subpoenaed documents could call their tax - exempt status into question also is at stake . legal and political science experts said it is a politically fraught issue that governments generally have trod carefully , or avoided altogether . <PARA> tax - exempt churches cannot use the pulpit to promote a specific candidate , but can use it as forum to discuss policy , such as the city ’ s equal rights ordinance , southern methodist university political science professor matthew wilson said . <PARA> “ the city was counting on the fact that the distinction would be muddled in the court of public opinion ,” wilson said . “ it wasn ’ t .” <PARA> feldman said the intent behind the subpoena was never to prove the churches were violating the terms of their tax - exempt status , but to produce proof that pastors who organized a petition drive to put a repeal referendum on the ballot knew the city ’ s rigorous charter rules but failed to follow them . <PARA> at the crux of opponents ’ lawsuit is whether feldman incorrectly invalidated their petitions to force a referendum . <PARA> “ the fact that you happen to be a pastor and you happen to be at a church doesn ’ t provide you with protection ,” feldman said . <PARA> the city may have a point , university of houston law professor peter linzer said . while the churches are correct that the original subpoena was too broad , the city likely has a legitimate right to seek communications about what specific petition instructions may have been given out , he said . <PARA> the original subpoena requests much more than that , seeking “ all speeches , presentations , or sermons related to hero , the petition , mayor annise parker , homosexuality , or gender identity prepared by , delivered by , revised by , or approved by you or in your possession .” <PARA> much of that request likely would be difficult to obtain , linzer said , but instructions germane to the case should not be protected . <PARA> “ when it comes to whether the ballot petition was correctly done , i see no constitutional problem with that ,” linzer said . “ i do see most of the current subpoena as overly broad .” <PARA> tax -

mixture	in november 2016 , petition site sumofus . org published a document claiming that the state of michigan was planning to sell 100 million gallons of water to nestlé for just $ 200 a year : <PARA> the petition cited two articles : a michigan live piece published on 3 november 2016 and an article by the guardian from 5 november 2016 , which reported : <PARA> that article mentioned flint as a problem that paralleled evart ’ s , not one that was directly related . regardless of what happened in evart , flint residents still remained without clean and safe drinking water , a circumstance that is close by , but unrelated to the evart plant ’ s activities : <PARA> as of 22 november 2016 , no decision had formally been reached : <PARA> sumofus ’ s petition implied that nestlé ’ s proposed increase was a done deal , when in actuality the public comment period remained open well after the petition appeared . the inclusion of flint ’ s ongoing water crisis was also misleading , as the problems in flint cannot be resolved by approving or denying plans to expand the evart plant . <PARA> previous efforts by sumofus included petitions claiming developers planned to put a mall in the grand canyon and that starbucks colluded with monsanto to sue vermont over labeling of genetically modified organisms .
false	one of the many prominent rumors circulated about apple ’ s iphone 7 long before its september 2016 unveiling ( and confirmed afterwards ) was that the device would no longer include a traditional 3 . 55 mm headphone jack . instead , apple announced , the iphone 7 would come with a set of apple earbuds designed to plug into the phone ’ s lightning connector port . <PARA> shortly afterwards , some online pranksters played on that change , circulating a fool ’ s errand image suggesting that the headphone jack was still present on the new phones but “ hidden behind the casing ” and could be accessed by drilling a small hole in the device ’ s shell : <PARA> we shouldn ’ t have to point out ( but we will ) that no amount of drilling will turn up the iphone 7 ’ s “ hidden ” headphone jack , as such a jack is no longer a feature included with that device . it ’ s possible the image was created simply as a joke mocking the company ’ s decision to drop the headphone jack , a decision that apple ’ s phil schiller maintained was made to make room for other , newer features :

to - day costs of living , etc . <PARA> origins : on 2 november 2010 , the press trust of india published an article about u . s . president barack obama ’ s upcoming 10 - day asian trip ( scheduled to begin in india , followed by visits to indonesia , south korea , and japan ), stating that the american chief executive would be accompanied by a contingent of 3 , 000 people and would be taking over the entire 570 - room taj mahal palace hotel during his stay in mumbai , at a cost to u . s . taxpayers of about $ 200 million per day . another report from the same source claimed the president would be “ protected by a fleet of 34 warships ” during his time in mumbai : <PARA> “ the huge amount of around $ 200 million would be spent on security , stay and other aspects of the presidential visit ,” a top official of the maharashtra government privy to the arrangements for the high -

blowing $ 200 million per day expense outlay was a single foreign news report which quoted an anonymous indian official and provided no detail whatsoever ( or even a general explanation ) about how the $ 200 million sum was derived or could possibly be expended . <PARA> any presidential trip abroad ( the purpose of this trip is official business , not a personal “ vacation ,” as claimed by some sources ) involves considerable expense to transport and house security officials and presidential aides and staffers , and those costs will likely be on the higher side for this trip <PARA> since president obama will be traveling to a city which was recently the target of terrorist attacks <PARA> and will be attending the g20 summit in seoul , south korea , along with other world leaders ( all of which requires <PARA> heightened security , as well as the presence of additional numbers of u . s . government officials ). <PARA> however , citing a cost figure of $ 200 million per day stretches credulity to the breaking point : that number would entail a total outlay of $ 400 million for the two - day visit ( a whopping $ 2 billion if the cost were applied across the entire ten - day trip ), and even if president obama were accompanied by a prodigious 3 , 000 - person entourage , with the u . s . government picking up the entire tab for all of them , the u . s . would have to be spending the unbelievably staggering sum of $ 66 , 000 per person per day to reach that figure . <PARA> and , as the the wall street journal observed , the details of the report are “ demonstrably incorrect ,” and it certainly isn ’ t the case that the u . s . will be picking up the tab for everyone traveling with the president : <PARA> the report is demonstrably incorrect . it says the white house had blocked off the entire taj mahal hotel in mumbai — it hasn ’ t — and that the press traveling with mr . obama will be staying there . we won ’ t . besides , the press pays its own way at considerable cost to the media outlets , not the u . s . taxpayer . <PARA> additionally , u . s . officials disclaimed numeric figures cited for the president ’ s asian visit as “ wildly inflated ” and “ absurd ”: <PARA> white house spokesman tommy vietor shot down the $ 200 million -

day trip to asia is not known to the public , an examination of similar presidential excursions in the past support the likelihood that the $ 200 million - a - day figure is exaggerated . <PARA> for example , an 11 -

mixture	origins : even in calmer times , rumors abound concerning important information the government is withholding from the public in order to “ prevent panic ” — everything from knowledge of superweapons developed by enemy nations to the existence of ufos and aliens . <PARA> given current conditions , “ the government isn ’ t telling us everything ” fever is bound to run high — <PARA> especially since there is undoubtedly a good deal of information relating to the september <PARA> 11 terrorist attacks that the government itself doesn ’ t yet know , and more information that the government can ’ t disclose because it might jeopardize their response to those attacks . still , no matter how much the government tells us , some people will always maintain there is a great deal more the government isn ’ t telling us . even though recent mailings of anthrax spores have received widespread coverage by the media , we ’ ve already heard rumors that the dangers such mailings pose are far greater than the government is letting on . <PARA> the warning quoted above is one example of current “ the government isn ’ t telling us everything ” rumors . how realistic is it ? the u . s . government , including the president , has been fairly consistent in warning us to expect that future terrorist attacks are highly probable . they haven ’ t provided any details about where or when or how these attacks might be launched , however , and persistent questioning by the press has brought the response that the government has no details about specific dangers , just information indicating that some general threat to america exists . is it plausible that they know more but just aren ’ t telling us ? <PARA> if the goal is to “ prevent panic ,” telling people to expect danger but not providing any details about what form that danger might take isn ’ t a generally effective method . uncertainty is the breeding ground for fear : we readily steel ourselves for the dangers we know , no matter how bad they might be , but we feel uncomfortably anxious and powerless when we have to contend with the unknown . consider the example of the passengers on united airlines flight 93 on september 11 . knowing that they were facing almost certain death , did they panic ? indications are that they did not . aware of the peril they faced , they fought back against their hijackers , and even though they were unable to save their own lives , they likely saved many others . would they have acted so bravely and decisively if , like the passengers on the other three flights hijacked that day , they had been uncertain about the hijackers ’ plans and unsure whether their own lives were truly at risk ? probably <PARA> the message cited here posits that president bush has credible information about a forthcoming “ chemical war ” to be waged on the united states , and that although he has chosen to keep this information secret from the general public , the president divulged it to bishop t . d . jakes of dallas in a private meeting and gave the bishop instructions not to disclose it to anyone else . notwithstanding the president ’ s instructions , bishop jakes then proceeded to warn his congregation to “ stock up on bottled water , canned foods , and nonperishable food items ” as well as flashlights , batteries , and other emergency items , all in anticipation of “ a chemical war that will effect [ sic ] our water system , electricity and crops .” if the bishop revealed all that after stating that he “ couldn ’ t disclose the information the president shared with him ,” how bad must the rest of what he knows be ? <PARA> even if we were to take this message seriously , a warning to anticipate a “ chemical war ” is a rather vague piece of information . what does this mean ? the use of poison gas ? the introduction of toxins into our food and water supplies ? bioterrorist attacks involving the deliberate spread of deadly diseases ? if any of these scenarios were to play out , we ’ d need a lot more than a handy supply of bottled water and flashlight batteries to see us safely through — a stockpile of gas masks , protective suits , and antibiotics would be more the order of the day . in any case , the amount of credibility afforded this information should be consistent with its source : an anonymous forwarder who passed along an “ e - mail from a friend who got a phone call from a close friend who attends bishop t . d . jakes ’ church .” holy foaf chain , batman ! if you can ’ t trust an anonymous forward of an e - mail from the friend of somebody who got a phone call from somebody else , what can you trust ? <PARA> bishop thomas d . jakes , sr ., is a prominent religious figure in america , religion , the head of the 18 , 000 - member potter ’ s house pentecostal church in dallas and the subject of a recent time magazine cover story which asked “ is this man the next billy graham ?” president bush knows bishop jakes , has attended his church , and has said he is often “ spellbound ” by jakes ’ preaching ; that the two men meet from time to time is not extraordinary . and not long after meeting with president bush , bishop jakes did recommend to his congregation that they stock up on supplies of bottled water and canned goods ( reasonably prudent advice given current circumstances ), but the connection between the meeting and the warning were only weakly linked , as bishop jakes explained in a statement of 9 october : <PARA> i returned from my meeting with the president with a strong sense of confidence in his ability to handle the situation at hand . as a spiritual leader , i certainly believe in peace ; yet , feel the need to prepare my congregation with practical tools and guidelines in the event of future terrorist activities . this mindset , however , was not prompted as a result of any secret the president shared with me during our meeting , but simply my responsibility as a ‘ watchman on the wall ’ in relation to the people and the congregation i serve .
false	in a testament to how social media users are attuned to right - wing dogwhistles , a facebook “ fan ” page ginned up anger simply by sharing a photograph of liberal billionaire george soros and making an unfounded claim without even the least patina of evidence . <PARA> the entirety of the post , published on 8 november 2018 on a page devoted to former fox news host bill o ’ reilly , was a picture of soros with the caption “ george soros demands democrats pay him back all money invested in lost elections !”: <PARA> despite the utter lack of evidence , members of the group reacted as if the post had stated something legitimate :
false	origins : news reporting on the internet is often akin to the children ’ s game of telephone : one web site publishes some dubious bit of information , another picks it up and repeats it in slightly rewritten form , a third site does the same with the second version , and eventually a daisy chain of reports leads to that dubious bit of information ’ s being reported as hard news , with no one following the chain back to the beginning to verify its validity . <PARA> such an occurrence took place on 6 april 2012 , when yahoo ! news ’ “ today in tech ” section published an article about the opening of the “ world ’ s first hotel for sheep ” in japan : <PARA> the life of the ludicrously rich in japan is indeed tough . you get to go on exotic vacations constantly , but each trip requires you to find a house sitter for your pet sheep . thankfully , though , the well - off japanese businessman has a new , elegant solution : hotel sheep . <PARA> apparently , <PARA> owning a pet sheep is the latest luxury for the wealthy and fashionable in japan . the animals are prized for their gentle demeanor . and because they ’ re insanely cute and cuddly , they ’ re adored to the point where luxury away accom - modations are a must . <PARA> lest you think this is just some hastily constructed sheep shelter , the folks at the extraordinarily opulent hotel sheep have created a marketing video for you to watch explaining the hotel ’ s amenities . sheep parents can rest easy knowing that their pets ’ rooms are equipped with television sets . <PARA> apparently , <PARA> owning a pet sheep is the latest luxury for the wealthy and fashionable in japan . the animals are prized for their gentle demeanor . and because they ’ re insanely cute and cuddly , they ’ re adored to the point where luxury away accom - modations are a must . <PARA> lest you think this is just some hastily constructed sheep shelter , the folks at the extraordinarily opulent hotel sheep have created a marketing video for you to watch explaining the hotel ’ s amenities . sheep parents can rest easy knowing that their pets ’ rooms are equipped with television sets . <PARA> the yahoo ! news item was a reprint of an article from tecca , which was in turn sourced from a report on bornrich , which in turn was apparently based on nothing more than the existence of a web site purporting to be the home of hotel sheep . it seems that no one involved in the reporting process was clued in by the notice on the blog for the putative hotel sheep that the establishment “ will be open for reservations on april 1 , 2012 ′′ — a date commonly known as april fools day . <PARA> if the date alone wasn ’ t enough of a giveaway that hotel sheep was nothing more than a seasonal jape , plenty of other clues were :

false	president donald trump has made a number of disparaging comments about mexicans and immigrants since stepping into the political spotlight . he has also repeatedly bragged about bringing the phrase “ merry christmas ” back to the white house ( despite the fact that it never left ). so when the satirical blog “ laughing in disbelief ” published an article in december 2018 reporting that president trump had banned the song “ feliz navidad ” from the white house , many readers found the claim to be plausible : <PARA> “ laughing in disbelief ” is a satirical blog published to the patheos platform , one which frequently posts content poking fun at religious institutions . a disclaimer on the website explains that if you ’ re reading an article on “ laughing in disbelief ,” then you are reading a piece of fiction : <PARA> this article appeared to be putting a spin on the numerous false rumors that were circulated during holiday seasons when president barack obama was in office . president trump ’ s predecessor was often falsely accused of having banned various aspects of the christmas holiday , such as the phrase “ merry christmas ,” nativity scenes , christmas cards , the charlie brown christmas special , and christmas trees .
false	a persistent chain e - mail still makes the rounds years after it first appeared , about the origin of canola oil . what it offered was a bit of truth about a product ’ s family history worked into a screed against the product itself : <PARA> there is no earthly reason to give any credence to this rumor : canola oil is not the horrifying product this widely - disseminated e - mail makes it out to be , nor has the fda turned loose on the american public a health scourge worthy of being named one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse . <PARA> an appreciation of what this scare is based upon begins with a better understanding of what canola oil and how it came into being . <PARA> the rape plant ( brassica napus ) is a member of the mustard family , as claimed in the e - mail . however , before associations between rape and mustard gas set in too strongly , it should be noted turnip , cabbage , watercress , horseradish , and radish are also members of this family of plants . <PARA> rapeseed oil has been used for cooking for centuries in europe , india , china , and japan . as modern science is finding out , its previous use wasn ’ t necessarily a guarantee of safety . cooking at high temperatures with unrefined rapeseed oil now appears to be related to an increased risk of lung cancer because at high temperatures cooking oil gives off chemicals capable of causing mutations in cells . unrefined rapeseed oil is particularly notable for this , but other oils also have this association . those intent upon doing large amounts of wok cooking with any sort of cooking oil should therefore lower their frying temperature from the 240 ° c to 280 ° c called for in chinese cooking to 180 ° c . <PARA> rapeseed oil naturally contains a high percentage ( 30 - 60 %) of erucic acid , a substance associated with heart lesions in laboratory animals . for this reason rapeseed oil was not used for consumption in the united states prior to 1974 , although it was used in other countries . ( americans chose to use it as a lubricant to maintain allied naval and merchant ships during world war ii .) <PARA> in 1974 , rapeseed varieties with a low erucic content were introduced . scientists had found a way to replace almost all of rapeseed ’ s erucic acid with oleic acid , a type of monounsaturated fatty acid . ( this change was accomplished through the cross - breeding of plants , not by the techniques commonly referred to as “ genetic engineering .”) by 1978 , all canadian rapeseed produced for food use contained less than 2 % erucic acid . the canadian seed oil industry rechristened the product “ canola oil ” ( canadian oil ) in 1978 in an attempt to distance the product from negative associations with the word “ rape .” canola was introduced to american consumers in 1986 . by 1990 , erucic acid levels in canola oil ranged from 0 . 5 % to 1 . 0 %, in compliance with u . s . food and drug administration ( fda ) standards . <PARA> this light , tasteless oil ’ s popularity is due to the structure of its fats . it is lower in saturated fat ( about 6 %) than any other oil . compare this to the high saturated fat content of peanut oil ( about 18 %) and palm oil ( at an incredibly high 79 %). it also contains more cholesterol - balancing monounsaturated fat than any oil except olive oil and has the distinction of containing omega - 3 fatty acids , a polyunsaturated fat reputed to not only lower both cholesterol and triglycerides , but also to contribute to brain growth and development . <PARA> in other words , it ’ s a healthy oil . one shouldn ’ t feel afraid to use it because of some internet scare loosely based on half - truths and outright lies .
false	rumors of imminent , wide - scale , mandatory radio - frequency identification ( rfid ) chipping in humans have circulated for many years . some claimed obamacare involved mandatory microchipping ( it didn ’ t ), others held that a large number of americans already sported rfid chips , and still more maintained that vulnerable populations , such as the homeless , were being chipped without consent in massive swaths . <PARA> a long - circulating variation on the latter claim involved individuals who received government assistance such as food stamps ( snap ) or general forms of what ’ s known as “ welfare ” ( such as temporary assistance for needy families , or tanf ). claims that welfare recipients would receive mandatory rfid chips weren ’ t novel in january 2016 : the unreliable web site disclose . tv featured a page with much of the same language in november 2011 . <PARA> not long after that version appeared , a nearly identical version was published by the disreputable and plagiaristic worldtruth . tv web site . an undated piece ( published on 27 december 2011 ) on that site involved a mishmash of information tangentially related to the claim about forcible microchipping , primarily citing a 1 december 1999 report from the united states department of agriculture . <PARA> the sixteen - year - old report focused on preliminary research into the use of “ biometric identification technology ” for such programs , but it very clearly didn ’ t reference rfid chips . the technologies under discussion were biometric identifiers , not microchip implantation : <PARA> a portion of worldtruth . tv ‘ s page was lifted directly from a conversational thread on disclose . tv published a few weeks earlier : <PARA> following directives to enter “ rfid ” into search fields on the listed government sites yielded no results . the united states department of agriculture web site , through which federal food stamps provisions are routed , yielded no search hits whatsoever . some results were returned on fmi . org ( the web site of the food marketing institute ), but none of them pertained to rfid use by federal agencies on food stamp recipients . all searches led back either to other conspiracy stories , or research unrelated to rfid chips and food stamps or welfare . <PARA> this rumor began circulating in 2011 ( or earlier ), yet since then no food stamp recipients have reported undergoing rfid chipping , forcible or otherwise . no credible items cited ( such as the 1999 usda report ) had anything at all to do with rfid chip use in food stamp recipients .
unproven	one mother ’ s tips for dealing with “ the flu ” spread widely on facebook in december 2018 , but it is unclear whether it has any medical merit : <PARA> the post which had been shared several hundred thousand times on social media at the time of this writing , stated : <PARA> the post also included a disclaimer stating that “ i am not a doctor . consult your doctor if you have questions about trying this . i am not responsible for customers consuming this product .” <PARA> the suggested remedy , though , has come under question from medical professionals . in 2009 the new york daily news briefly mentioned “ syrup from canned fruit cocktail ” as part of a guide to myths and realities surrounding treatment of a stomach flu . <PARA> in that article richard fleece , an assistant professor of clinical pediatrics at temple university , described it as an “ old - school ” approach to the problem comparable to drinking coca - cola ( which can contain fructose syrup ) to settle the stomach . instead , he advised , people suffering from the stomach flu should drink pedialyte , which can replenish the body ’ s electrolyte supply . “ if you don ’ t have pedialyte , dilute gatorade or flat ginger ale 50 - 50 ,” he added . <PARA> john townes , a professor at the oregon health & science university school of medicine specializing in infectious diseases , was also skeptical that peach syrup could help after reading the more recent claim . he pointed out that “ nausea and vomiting are not a primary symptom of ‘ the flu .'” <PARA> what people describe as the “ stomach flu ” or the “ 24 - hour flu ,” townes said , is usually a norovirus . these types of organisms have a dense structure that makes them resistant to stomach acids and normal household cleaners , thus enabling them to survive in various environments for extended periods of time and making them extremely contagious . <PARA> “ what would [ fruit syrup ] do to somebody who had norovirus ? i think it would probably do nothing ,” he said , adding that he was “ not aware of any study ” examining syrup ’ s potential as a treatment in these types of cases . <PARA> it is possible , townes allowed , that the syrup could settle an upset stomach . <PARA> “ it probably won ’ t hurt you much , but for somebody who ’ s diabetic it ’ s probably not a good idea ,” he offered . “ just because [ the advice is ] shared around doesn ’ t make it [ accurate ]. <PARA> noroviruses usually run their course in 12 to 24 hours , townes said , and will often include some episodes of vomiting . <PARA> “ if you can ’ t keep anything down for more than a day , you should contact your doctor ,” he advised . “ you may need to get an antiemetic medication .” <PARA> according to the centers for disease control ( cdc ), between 19 million and 21 million people in the u . s . contract a norovirus every year . to avoid spreading the virus to others , the cdc urges anyone dealing with it to thoroughly clean not only their hands , but also any affected clothing and any areas in which they suffered nausea or diarrhea .

false	in december 2019 , numerous readers asked us about the accuracy of claims that the evangelical magazine christianity today was either “ backed ” or funded by the billionaire , liberal philanthropist george soros . <PARA> those reports came in the aftermath of a dec . 19 editorial by the publication ’ s editor - in - chief mark galli , who called for u . s . president donald trump to be removed from office , whether by impeachment or by popular vote in the 2020 presidential election , and described trump as “ a near perfect example of a human being who is morally lost and confused .” <PARA> despite the fact that christianity today is a long - established christian conservative publication , which similarly indicted democratic president bill clinton ’ s moral authority to govern in the midst of the monica lewinsky scandal , trump and some of his supporters quickly endeavored to discredit christianity today and portray it as an ideologically motivated , left - wing , or even corrupt , organization . in a tweet , the president denounced the publication as a “ far - left magazine .” <PARA> on dec . 20 , the conservative christian website pulpit and pen , which is part of the baptist , montana - based polemics ministry united , published an article with the headline “ remember that ‘ christianity today ’ is backed by george soros .” the article reported that : <PARA> on dec . 22 , the right - leaning website dc dirty laundry published a tweaked version of pulpit and pen ’ s article , and claimed that christianity today was “ funded by george soros ,” writing : <PARA> “ christianity today has now strongly endorsed the impeachment of president trump and it ’ s time to expose them as the false teachers they are ... do you realize that christianity today is partially funded by george soros ?” <PARA> soros has long been the subject of a seemingly endless series of fevered , baseless conspiracy theories , often inspired or aligned with anti - semitic tropes , which portray him as a shadowy , sinister , and unaccountable figure who exerts disproportionate control over global affairs . his status as a hate figure among many right - leaning observers and consumers of baseless conspiracy theories means that merely associating a given person or group with soros has become a method of choice for discrediting an opponent or rhetorical target . <PARA> so it was in the case of christianity today and its detractors in december 2019 . neither the publication nor its parent organization , the non - profit christianity today international , have received funding or institutional backing from soros ; claims to the contrary were based on a ludicrous distortion of extremely tenuous “ connections ” — an example of the kind of “ joining the dots ” that fuels many ultimately baseless conspiracy theories . <PARA> in response to our requests for comment , tim dalrymple , president and ceo of christianity today international , told snopes that : <PARA> “ christianity today covers 85 percent of its annual budget through earned revenue : mostly subscriptions , advertising , and product sales . only 15 percent of our budget comes through gifts and grants . we have never received a donation from george soros or the open society foundation . of the foundations who have given us support , we cannot find any connection to soros or any of his funding entities .” <PARA> we examined the organization ’ s three most recent tax returns , from 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 . none of those forms , nor any of the accompanying documents , contained any reference or information indicating any association between christianity today international or its subsidiary publication christianity today , and soros or any of his associated philanthropic organizations . <PARA> the claim that christianity today is “ backed ” or funded by soros , or that it is a “ soros front organization ,” is simply false . <PARA> the link drawn by pulpit and pen consisted of the following , relatively convoluted connections : <PARA> in november , the evangelical immigration table , an initiative by evangelical pastors that promotes and emphasizes the dignity and humanity of displaced migrants , launched a campaign called the evangelical call for restitution - based immigration reform . one of those who supported the campaign was ed stetzer , a pastor and christianity today columnist , who wrote in a tweet that the campaign “ points to a way forward on immigration that ’ s guided by biblical principles .” <PARA> on nov . 9 , christianity today published a column by matthew soerens , national coordinator of the evangelical immigration table , in which he explained and promoted the campaign . <PARA> the evangelical immigration table shares links with another organization called the national immigration forum . in 2013 , for example , the forum provided funding for an evangelical immigration table advertising campaign that promoted immigration reform and was targeted towards christians . <PARA> according to figures published by the right - leaning website breitbart , the national immigration forum received just under $ 3 . 3 million in grant money from soros ’ open society foundation in 2009 and 2010 . in 2013 , the forum ’ s executive director ali noorani acknowledged ( without providing specific details ) that it had received some open society foundation funding , but said none of it was used to pay for the ad campaign . <PARA> because christianity today has not received funding from soros or his open society foundation , and because it is not a “ front organization ” for the philanthropist , as pulpit and pen falsely claimed , those seeking to discredit the publication by associating it with soros were forced to stretch and distort the existing facts at their disposal . <PARA> almost a decade ago , the national immigration forum received some funding from a soros organization . a few years later , the forum paid for a pro - immigration reform advertising campaign by the evangelical immigration table , but no funding from soros was used in that particular endeavor . six years later , in 2019 , the evangelical immigration table launched another campaign in favor of restitution - based , biblically founded immigration reform . christianity today hosted a column written by the evangelical immigration table ’ s national coordinator , and one of its columnists ( stetzer ) publicly supported the campaign . <PARA> it was on the basis of those facts that pulpit and pen , dc dirty laundry and others reached the factually insupportable conclusion that christianity today was “ backed ” and funded by soros . neither was true .
unproven	examples : <PARA> a young lady on her way home in her 4 by 4 from an evening out approaches a set of traffic lights in a deserted area and sees the body of a man lying in the middle of the junction . realising that hi - jackers often use this ruse to lure their unsuspecting victims out of their cars the young lady drives off the road and into the adjoining veld ( overgrown wasteland ) and skirts around the junction and the prostrate form . she drives to the local police station to report the incident ( just in case the lifeless form is genuine ). the police escort her back to the scene where there is no sign of the man who was lying in the road . however , after a little further investigation the police discover the dead bodies of 3 ( or 4 ) armed men in the veld where they had been lying in wait for her to stop the vehicle . she had ridden over them when she took her detour around the “ body ”. <PARA> [ collected on the internet , 1999 ] <PARA> a woman was driving home one night ( in her 4 wheel drive vehicle ) along a remote road outside johannesburg , an area where numerous car - jackings had taken place . ahead of her she saw an abandoned car parked across the middle of the narrow road . fully aware of the danger of stopping , or even slowing down , she pushed her foot down on the accelerator , and drove off the road , along the bumpy grass shoulder , and back onto the road when she had passed the car . when she got home she phoned the police , reported the suspicious vehicle and went to bed . <PARA> in the morning , she was paid a visit by the police . they asked for more information about the previous night ’ s events . she could only repeat that she had driven at high speed , and fortunately , as she was in a 4 wheel drive was able to drive off the road , through the brush , and back onto the road . it then transpired that in doing so she had driven over and killed the three men who were lying in wait to ambush her . <PARA> origins : though not heard too often in north america , the preceding legend has been rife in south africa at least since 1996 . ( i ’ m told five out of every ten south africans claims this story happened to a friend or <PARA> neighbor .) <PARA> any carjacking legend that has the intended victim not only foiling the attempt but also doing in a couple of the bad guys is going to find a very receptive audience in south africa . within the last decade , violent crime has become a fact of life in that country , with vicious carjackings suddenly almost an everyday occurrence even in the best neighborhoods . many south africans — black and white — will not now venture out of their homes without a gun . for good reason too : in 1997 the boys with the calculators worked out that every week in south africa there were 434 murders , 7 , 210 thefts , 1 , 218 armed robberies and 952 rapes . that ’ s nothing to sneeze at , considering there are only 40 . 5 million people in the whole country . to put these numbers in better perspective , south africa ’ s 1997 murder rate was 52 people per 100 , 000 , compared with a u . s . rate of 6 . 8 the same year . <PARA> armed carjacking occurs on an all too frequent basis , taking place mainly in relatively populated areas : at traffic lights and stop signs , in parking lots , and in the driveways of homes . in the first eleven months of 1998 , there were 13 , 000 carjackings . fewer than one in ten carjacking cases ends up in court , and only one in fifty ends in a conviction . moreover , people end up dead over this . <PARA> being carjacked has become a major fear of every south african vehicle owner . in 1994 , 17 , 560 vehicles were hijacked ( another 91 , 786 were simply stolen ). in the process , 36 people were killed and another 851 injured . <PARA> south africans are fighting back . as the problems worsened and more temperate responses failed to have appreciable effect ( educating drivers about how to spot trouble and avoid confrontations , installing conventional anti - theft devices on vehicles ), more drastic measures have taken their place . in 1999 , it ’ s possible to get your car equipped with the latest in personal security weapons — a driver - operated flamethrower called the blaster . <PARA> the $ 650 device is built into the car doors , and is operated by pushing a button beside the foot pedals . it sends a man - high fireball from the car , engulfing the hijacker without endangering passengers or damaging the car ’ s paint job . <PARA> that might sound like overkill , but consider this : conventional solutions have failed badly , often only working to escalate the danger to drivers . south africa used to be a nation plagued by run - of - the - mill auto thefts in which cars were made off with while their owners were elsewhere . as auto theft statistics began to soar , owners invested in more and more sophisticated security devices . the most popular of these was the high - tech “ immobilizer ” which ensures the starter motor will accept only the original key . <PARA> being crafty , the thieves , upon realizing that they too needed the original keys to start cars , shifted from theft to carjacking . <PARA> ignition switches in many of the more expensive cars sold in south africa were then fitted with combination locks . to start the car , the correct combination had to be punched into the device . <PARA> this was no problem to the carjackers ; it just gave them more cause to be violent . they forced the code information from the carjacked drivers at gun or knife - point . <PARA> the security people got smarter . they patented a device which could neutralize the engine by remote control from a distance of several kilometers . the idea was that a driver could allow the thief to drive off with the vehicle and then “ immobilize ” it from a safe distance . <PARA> so the villains took drivers and passengers as hostages , and this inevitably resulted in killings . <PARA> at this point , owning a car that shoots a fireball starts to sound like a reasonable idea . in south africa , what in other countries would be a loss - of - property situation becomes a life - and - death struggle . <PARA> over the years , the advice given to south african drivers hasn ’ t been much more effective at preventing carjackings than the non - aggressive security devices mentioned above . a 1995 article suggested ramming the car in front of you at an intersection if someone attempted to carjack your vehicle . ( no , i ’ ve no idea what good that would do either .) a 1997 article gave the following advice for avoiding becoming a carjack statistic in south africa . in short : don ’ t drive , and don ’ t own a car . and if you must do either , then be prepared to never relax your vigilance . <PARA> now that you ’ re a little better acquainted with the carjacking situation in south africa , you probably better understand the delight often expressed over this legend . ordinary citizens are ending up hurt , maimed , or dead simply because they own cars someone else wants to sell for parts . that one of those ordinary citizens could not only escape unharmed but in the process kill off three or four of these murderers is seen as nothing but justice come at last . <PARA> barbara “ carjackin whirled ” mikkelson
mixture	examples : [ collected via e - mail , october 2014 ] <PARA> “ don ’ t use phrases such as ‘ boys and girls ,’ ‘ you guys ,’ ‘ ladies and gentlemen ,’ and similarly gendered expressions to get kids ’ attention ,” instructs a training document given to middle - school teachers at lincoln public schools . <PARA> i just read an article saying that nebraska will now start requiring that all students be called “ purple penguins ” instead of boys and girls . is this true ? it was on foxnews . com , so i ’ m skeptical . <PARA> origins : on 8 october 2014 , the national review <PARA> published an article concerning gender identity and inclusiveness training at lincoln public schools ( lps ) in lincoln , nebraska . according to that article , educators within the school district had been ordered to refrain from using specifically gendered terms when speaking or referring to students in favor of gender neutral terms such as “ purple penguins .” <PARA> the article made specific reference to materials provided by gender spectrum , an organization whose website states a goal of fostering “ gender sensitive and inclusive environment for all children and teens .” national review cited paraphrased materials purportedly provided to educators that painted a picture of a full - scale ban on genders in the lincoln school district : <PARA> “ create classroom names and then ask all of the ‘ purple penguins ’ to meet on the rug ,” it advises . <PARA> the document also warns against asking students to “ line up as boys or girls ,” and suggests asking them to line up by whether they prefer “ skateboards or bikes / milk or juice / dogs or cats / summer or winter / talking or listening .” <PARA> “ always ask yourself ... ‘ will this configuration create a gendered space ?'” the document says .” <PARA> word of lincoln public schools ’ gender inclusivity training quickly spread across blogs and on twitter , morphing into a cautionary tale of political correctness run rampant : <PARA> “ instead ,” the guidelines dictate , “ use things like ‘ odd and even birth date ...’ <PARA> educators should prominently display photographs of gender - benders in the classroom , the new policy insists , and give students at least four choices when it is imperative that gender be determined . <PARA> much of the airtime given to the matter of gender sensitivity training in lincoln framed the materials supplied as mandates or rules imposed on all schools within the district . however , as brenda leggiardo , lps coordinator of social workers and counselors clarified to the lincoln journal star after the issue gained widespread attention , the materials were provided as guidelines for educators to better understand gender identity issues and were not intended to impose rules mandating how those issues should be addressed : <PARA> and they were not meant as rules staff had to follow , but as suggestions for how teachers can make students feel comfortable . it also stresses the impact words can have on others , leggiardo said . <PARA> “ if there ’ s a staff member that ’ s uninformed and unsupportive , that can be pretty scary for a family maybe struggling to understand transgender issues themselves ,” she said . <PARA> lps superintendent steve joel also held a press conference to assert that the district had made no changes to their policies and imposed no mandates ; the material in question consisted only of suggestions for “ how teachers could reach all students in their classroom ”: <PARA> “ it ’ s indeed regrettable that for the last week and a half we ’ ve had to dedicate as much staff time and resources to address an issue that is not founded in fact ,” he said at a news conference . <PARA> “ never once has anyone inside our system mandated that a teacher take ( the words ) ‘ boys ’ and ‘ girls ’ or ‘ ladies ’ and ‘ gentlemen ’ out of their interactions with children or interaction with adults . there ’ s no policy , there ’ s no procedure , there ’ s no changes being made to bathrooms in schools .” <PARA> fox news and other national outlets picked up on local news reports about the district ’ s gender identity training , specifically handouts used with teachers at irving middle school that included one from the nonprofit organization gender spectrum entitled “ 12 easy steps to gender inclusiveness .” <PARA> joel said the handouts were suggestions and strategies , not mandates , about how teachers could reach all students in their classrooms . the training occurred at the request of an irving teacher looking for guidance dealing with students . <PARA> “ this was about adults , professional educators , who care deeply about trying to reach and establish relationships with children ,” joel said . “ they are looking for strategies about how to be more effective in the classroom .” <PARA> during administrative leadership days prior to the beginning of the school year , lps officials shared several recent news stories about transgender persons to help administrators better understand the issues that face some students , so they feel comfortable and welcome at school .

true	examples : <PARA> origins : yes , it ’ s true — anheuser - busch was running print ads aimed at securing the gay community ’ s beer money . but before you allow yourself to be drawn into the “ pro - gay / anti - gay ” debate , consider this : those ads were limited to gay publications only . don ’ t expect to see them pop up even in middle - of - the - road magazines that happen to draw some of their readership from the gay community ; the ads aren ’ t meant for that market . <PARA> in other words , this controversy is over nothing . falwell ’ s and his followers ’ concern about “ homosexual images coming into our homes through reckless advertising campaigns ” is misplaced ; unless he and his people have taken to reading gay magazines and newspapers , they ’ ll never <PARA> encounter the ads . equally , those looking to do battle with the religious right to keep anheuser - busch from pulling these ads are fighting a phantom battle : anheuser - busch has shown no indication of wanting to end this particular bud light print ad campaign . <PARA> targeted advertising featuring members of the group being advertised to is nothing new . one expects to find ads featuring african - americans in ebony just as one expects to find images of happy housewives in the ads sold into family circle . that same - sex pairings are used in ads appearing in gay publications shouldn ’ t surprise anyone . indeed , in that venue , ads featuring opposite - sex pairings would be horribly out of place , and one could then quite rightly call into question the sanity of any advertiser insensitive enough to figure it could market in such a forum with ads featuring boy - girl pairings . <PARA> anheuser - busch isn ’ t the only large corporation using same - sex pairings in its gay publications advertising . in a 1998 issue of the advocate , for example , a two - page ad from ibm featured a male couple saying , “ we ’ re not your typical mom & pop operation . we ’ re not even your typical pop & pop operation .” an american express ad in the same issue shows a female couple on the beach , wondering about their financial <PARA> future . <PARA> an anheuser - busch spokesman said , “ it ’ s surprising to us that one print ad placed in select gay - oriented magazines has attracted attention . today ’ s consumer is not one of a specific gender , race , geography or orientation . we appreciate and respect the views of all our customers .” <PARA> which probably explains the two phone numbers . anheuser - busch appears to appreciate the need on both sides to vent feelings a bit by registering a vote either for or against the ads . there ’ s no indication from the brewer , however , that those votes are going to influence anything , or even that they ’ ll be tallied . even so , giving people a way to feel they ’ ve made themselves heard is a smart move on the part of the company . <PARA> controlling almost half of the u . s . beer market , anheuser - busch is the nation ’ s largest beer maker in terms of sales and one of the top brewers in the world . it produces bud and bud light in addition to michelob , busch , ziegenbock amber , red wolf lager and others , including o ’ doul ’ s non - alcoholic beer . <PARA> there are three major brewers in the u . s .: anheuser - busch , miller , and coors . what to drink if you want to either support or boycott gay - friendly brewers is a matter open for debate . of the big three , coors is the only one to offer domestic partnership benefits to its gay employees , but the coors family also supports organizations that have a history of anti - gay decisions . miller and anheuser - busch have non - discrimination policies and support the gay community in some ways , but neither offer benefits for unmarried couples . <PARA> barbara “ is this bud for you ?” mikkelson

mixture	on 13 april 2017 , senator jeff flake of arizona took part in a town hall meeting with some of his constituents that , like several other such events held by u . s . congress members in the early part of the year , proved to be something of a contentious one for the republican u . s . senator : <PARA> during that town hall meeting , senator flake engaged in a several - minute exchange with a constituent who urged the lawmaker to support efforts to promote alternative energy sources over fossil fuels and address climate change issues . one small portion of that exchange was later incorporated into an image macro that was widely spread online to make it appear as if the senator were ignorant about the basics of solar power : <PARA> as video of the town hall event captures , senator flake engaged a constituent ( who introduced himself as a major in the u . s . army reserve and a recent graduate of arizona state university with a degree in sustainability ) in a fairly extensive conversation about alternative energy sources , with the constituent advocating the promotion of solar power technologies in arizona , given that the state is blessed with an abundance of sunshine . in response , the senator didn ’ t disdain the idea by expressing the absurd concept that solar energy wouldn ’ t be available at night . rather , flake ’ s contention was that battery technology was not yet sufficiently developed to be able to store enough solar - derived energy to provide “ base load power ” to cities during non - daylight hours , and thus the use of solar energy exclusively was not yet feasible — that if we wished to completely eliminate our use of fossil fuels , for the time being solar power would have to be supplemented by other non - carbon energy sources , such as nuclear power . <PARA> this discussion of alternative energy sources begins at the 13 : 00 mark in the following video , with senator flake ’ s now - infamous comment occurring a 18 : 20 — after more than five minutes of back - and - forth that established the context in which he made it : <PARA> clearly , senator flake was aware that solar - derived energy can be stored in batteries for later use , as the point he was disputing with his constituent was the state of the art in battery technology — flake maintained batteries couldn ’ t currently provide “ base load power ” levels to cities , while the constituent countered by referencing a solar energy station built by tesla on the hawaiian island of kauai : <PARA> whether senator flake was right or wrong about the particulars of the current state of solar energy and battery technologies , he did demonstrate a working awareness of the manner in which energy from the sun is collected and stored , and he did not express a belief that dependence on solar energy would necessarily mean residents would have to go without power at night . the video of the town hall event shows that senator flake and a constituent disagreed about the current scalability of power gathered from the sun but were not in disagreement about the existence of solar technologies or the availability of sun - harvested energy at night . nonetheless , the senator ’ s remarks were misleadingly truncated and altered ( replacing “ power ” with “ lights ”) and shared online in a form that falsely suggested he did not understand how solar power works .
true	when freedom came in she could not stand . both wings were broken , her left wing in 4 places . she was emaciated and covered in lice . we made the decision to give her a chance at life , so i took her to the vet ’ s office . from then on , i was always around her . we had her in a huge dog carrier with the top off , and it was loaded up with shredded newspaper for her to lay in . i used to sit and talk to her , urging her to live , to fight ; and she would lay there looking at me with those big brown eyes . we also had to tube feed her for weeks . <PARA> this went on for 4 - 6 weeks , and by then she still couldn ’ t stand . it got to the point where the decision was made to euthanize her if she couldn ’ t stand in a week . you know you don ’ t want to cross that line between torture and rehab , and it looked like death was winning . she was going to be put down that friday , and i was <PARA> supposed to come in on that thursday afternoon . i didn ’ t want to go to the center that thursday , because i couldn ’ t bear the thought of her being euthanized ; but i went anyway , and when i walked in everyone was grinning from ear to ear . i went immediately back to her dowl cage ; and there she was , standing on her own , a big beautiful eagle . she was ready to live . i was just about in tears by then . that was a very good day . <PARA> we knew she could never fly , so the director asked me to glove train her . i got her used to the glove , and then to jesses , and we started doing education programs for schools in western washington . we wound up in the newspapers , radio ( believe it or not ) and some tv . miracle pets even did a show about us . <PARA> in the spring of 2000 , i was diagnosed with non - hodgkins lymphoma . i had stage 3 , which is not good ( one major organ plus everywhere ), so i wound up doing 8 months of chemo . lost the hair & mdash the whole bit . i missed a lot of work . when i felt good enough , i would go to sarvey and take freedom out for walks . freedom would also come to me in my dreams and help me fight the cancer . this happened time and time again . <PARA> fast forward to november 2000 , the day after thanksgiving , i went in for my last checkup . i was told that if the cancer was not all gone after 8 rounds of chemo , then my last option was a stem cell transplant . anyway , they did the tests ; and i had to come back monday for the results . i went in monday , and i was told that all the cancer was gone . yahoo ! <PARA> so the first thing i did was get up to sarvey and take the big girl out for a walk .. it was misty and cold . i went to her flight and jessed her up , and we went out front to the top of the hill . i hadn ’ t said a word to freedom , but somehow she knew . she looked at me and wrapped both her wings around me to where i could feel them pressing in on my back ( i was engulfed in eagle wings ), and she touched my nose with her beak and stared into my eyes , and we just stood there like that for i don ’ t know how long . that was a magic moment . we have been soul mates ever since she came in . this is a very special bird . <PARA> on a side note : i have had people who were sick come up to us when we are out , and freedom has some kind of hold on them . i once had a guy who was terminal come up to us and i let him hold her . his knees just about buckled and he swore he could feel her power coarse through his body . i have so many stories like that . <PARA> i never forget the honor i have of being so close to such a magnificent spirit as freedom ’ s . <PARA> origins : jeff guidry is a rock and rhythm - and - blues guitarist who lives in monroe , washington , and volunteers his spare time working as a member of the educational team at the sarvey wildlife care center , a wildlife care center located in everett , washington which provides food , shelter , and rehabilitation to orphaned and injured wildlife . beginning in august 1998 , jeff and the staff at sarvey spent weeks tending to freedom , a baby eagle who had been brought in emaciated and covered in lice , with two broken wings , and nursed her back to health . in 2008 , jeff penned the account reproduced above , recounting his ten - year experience with freedom and his own battle with cancer . <PARA> another account of freedom ’ s rescue and subsequent healing ( entitled “ the circle of healing ”), also authored by jeff , was published on the sarvey wildlife center ’ s web site , as was a short piece about freedom ’ s impromptu “ birthday bash .” in 2010 , jeff published a longer account of his and freedom ’ s story in the book an eagle named freedom : my true story of a remarkable friendship . <PARA> additional photos of freedom and jeff can be viewed here .

false	cayenne pepper powder is produced from capsicum peppers and contains capsaicin , the chemical responsible for a pepper ’ s spiciness . it is also , according to some corners of the internet , extremely popular as an herbal remedy for just about every ailment under the sun . one particularly dubious claim regarding cayenne pepper comes from the website of david wolfe , which is already well - known as a safe harbor for flawed scientific premises . <PARA> in a widely shared article first published in february 2016 and titled “ how to stop serious bleeding in 10 seconds !” the website asserted the following treatment for stopping bleeding : <PARA> credible evidence provided in support of this assertion was scant . citing a dead “ ehow ” link , the website “ cayenne - pepper . info ”, and an herbal remedy book originally published in the 1970s , the article made two broad claims about how cayenne pepper might affect bleeding . <PARA> the first claim was that cayenne pepper can stop bleeding when it is put directly in an open wound : “ cayenne pepper ... can be used on any cut to stop bleeding and can be applied topically or taken orally ,” the article reads . though the mechanism was not clearly explained on davidwolfe . com , other sources making similar claims suggest that “ capsicum is so ‘ hot ’ that it has an ability to actually cauterize a wound in some cases ” or that “ it also brings blood to the area to which it is applied and therefore can enhance your healing [ because ] blood circulation brings nutrients and oxygen and is imperative to the process of tissue healing .” <PARA> the second claim suggests that cayenne pepper can stop bleeding when it is ingested orally . quoting the website “ cayenne - pepper . info ”, the wolfe article repeated the claim that “ whether the bleeding is internal or external , a teaspoon of cayenne taken orally in a glass of hot water will stop the bleeding quickly .” wolfe ’ s article suggested that the mechanism for both oral ingestion and the aforementioned topical application was the same : that the capsaicin “ equalizes ” blood pressure . the article maintained that capsaicin “ reacts with the body to equalize the blood pressure , meaning an extra gushing of pressure will not be concentrated in the wound area as it normally is ,” adding that “ blood will quickly clot when the pressure is equalized .” <PARA> none of that is how any of this works . <PARA> the notion that the heat perceived by a human who experiences cayenne pepper in an open flesh wound could cauterize that wound is absurd . capsaicin does not actually create heat , but rather it binds to a specific pain receptor in a way that mimics the sensation of pain and heat . cauterization , the process of burning ( or freezing ) skin with metal or chemicals to stop bleeding and prevent infection , requires actual heat , cold , or specific acids that produce chemical burns , none of which is provided by cayenne pepper powder . <PARA> it is for related reasons that capsaicin has been investigated as a possible topical pain reliever . several studies have shown the chemical is capable of reducing pain , likely through a process that involves depleting the chemicals responsible for sending pain signals after they are overstimulated . a reduction in pain , however , is significantly different than a reduction in bleeding . <PARA> the top google search results for the vaguely medical - sounding phrase “ equalize blood pressure ” are links to the very same articles about capsaicin ’ s ability to stop bleeding that we are working to debunk . however , in the herbal remedy world , the term appears most commonly to mean “ lowering or raising [ blood pressure ] to normal levels ,” according to the 2001 book herbal remedies : a quick and easy guide to common disorders and their herbal treatments . <PARA> the effect capsaicin has on blood pressure is a complicated and poorly understood area of science , and various studies suggest it has an ability to both raise or lower blood pressure depending on how and / or when it is administered . the potential ability for capsaicin to raise or lower blood pressure , however , is wholly irrelevant to the issue of wound healing , according to lawrence fine , a scientist with the division of cardiovascular science at the national heart , lung , and blood institute . “ i am unaware of any science information [ holding ] that any change within the normal range of blood pressure will affect wounding healing ,” he told us via email . <PARA> with the mysterious “ equalizing blood pressure ” mechanism squarely behind us , we can attempt to make sense of the claim that “ blood circulation brings nutrients and oxygen and is imperative to the process of tissue healing .” blood ’ s role in transporting oxygen and other important chemicals within the human body is obvious and not controversial . however , specific chemicals ( not scientific platitudes ) are associated with the process of coagulation . “ clotting is easier ” after ingesting cayenne pepper , wolfe ’ s article suggested without evidence . <PARA> “ i ’ m unaware of any scientific data to support the claim that cayenne pepper can stop bleeding ,” donna di michele , the deputy director of the division of blood diseases and resources at the national heart , lung , and blood institute , told us via email . “ capsicum , which is a species of pepper , is sometimes listed as a food or supplement that may increase the likelihood of bleeding in individuals who are so predisposed , particularly when on an anticoagulant ,” she said , adding that some uncertainty in this area of research still exists . <PARA> indeed , this is perhaps the most perverse part of wolfe ’ s clickbait : the fact that the purported remedy he selected for curtailing bleeding time may in fact be associated with the risk of increasing the time it takes to stop bleeding .
mixture	things stolen from the car included a garage door remote control , some money and a gps which had been prominently mounted on the dashboard . <PARA> when the victims got home , they found that their house had been ransacked and just about everything worth anything had been stolen . <PARA> the thieves had used the gps to guide them to the house . they then used the garage remote control to open the garage door and gain entry to the house . <PARA> the thieves knew the owners were at the football game , they knew what time the game was scheduled to finish and so they knew how much time they had to clean up the house . <PARA> it would appear that they had brought a truck to empty the house of its contents . <PARA> origins : this account of a burglary facilitated by the victims ’ own technology ( gps and automatic garage door openers ) began its online life in december 2008 . it has come to be circulated as the first of two “ their own technology turned against them ” stories , the second being the 2006 tale about the cell phone lifted from a stolen purse used to trick a woman ’ s husband into revealing <PARA> the pin to the couple ’ s bank accounts . <PARA> like the “ text message used to trick the husband into giving out the pin ” story , nothing is provided in the gps burglary account that would help determine the who , when and where of the break - in , details necessary to the process of tracking down the incident . moreover , the story is provided as a “ friend of a friend ” ( foaf ) tale : the unknown e - mail ’ s writer wasn ’ t the one who was burglarized , nor did the robbery purportedly happen to a friend of that person , but to an acquaintance of that friend . that ’ s about as untraceable as it gets ! <PARA> however , while the e - mailed account is untraceable , there have been thefts where a car ’ s gps led the way to the booty . in august 2007 , the “ sat nav ” ( gps ) stolen from a car parked at alton towers , a theme park in great britain , directed thieves to the vehicle owner ’ s residence via its “ home ” key being used to divulge that location . although the home wasn ’ t broken into , the £ 20 , 000 saab convertible that had been left parked in its driveway was made off with . the vehicle was later recovered . <PARA> in january 2009 keys taken from a valet parking station in manhasset , new york , were used to steal a diner ’ s 2008 mercedes benz , then additional keys left in that car plus that vehicle ’ s gps used to lead thieves to the victim ’ s home , where they made off with a second vehicle left parked in the home ’ s driveway , a 2003 porsche . <PARA> it needs be noted that in both those incidents , keys to the second vehicles taken had been left in the first vehicles broken into , thus the car thieves knew the nature of the booty in store for them if they were able to coax the right information out of the acquired gps . <PARA> in september 2009 , dwayne wilkinson and hugh brown of white plains , new york were arrested in connection with more than 300 burglaries . investigators said the pair would break into a car , use a gps device to locate the car owner ’ s address and access the home with the help of a garage door opener . <PARA> real incidents or not , the fear that robbers will use their victim ’ s global positioning systems to gain their home addresses is likely exaggerated . robbers typically favor low - tech <PARA> solutions over high - tech ones , and it ’ s far simpler to rifle a car ’ s glove compartment for bills or documents bearing the vehicle owner ’ s information than it is to fiddle with ( unfamiliar ) electronic devices . moreover , while only some cars have dash - mounted gps units at this time , nearly all vehicles have at least one or two easily accessible items bearing the car owner ’ s address . <PARA> also , such a “ this could happen to you !” warning rubs against the same rock that sinks other cautionary tales ( such as a recent item about stolen handbags ): the presumption that a particular house necessarily stands empty if one resident has been tricked into leaving it or is known to be elsewhere . a potential burglar breaking into randomly selected cars parked at the site of a football game would have no way of knowing that the vehicle owners ’ homes weren ’ t occupied by various other family members or friends , or even an ill - tempered , sharp - toothed dog or three . <PARA> there have been instances , though , of crooks breaking into cars and harvesting automatic garage door openers which they subsequently used to gain easy access to victims ’ homes . news stories we ’ ve found about such robberies tend to indicate such devices are primarily used to open and raid garages rather than to gain entry to the houses themselves , but even so householders have had their children ’ s bikes and christmas presents stolen out of locked garages via this mode of entry . <PARA> there is one small nugget of truth in the “ this could happen to you !” fable : the majority of burglars prefer to go about their business while the home they ’ re breaking into is unoccupied . some even choose which domiciles to burgle based on knowledge that the residents will be elsewhere at the time of the break - ins ( e . g ., those who select their targets via the obituary pages ). <PARA> a well - traveled urban legend fits the “ one theft facilitating a subsequent burglary ” pattern of the gps tale . in the “ ticket taker “ legend , a stolen car is returned to its owners , with the thief leaving in it a note and some theater tickets by way of an apology . but of course the tickets prove to be just a way of emptying the targeted home so that it can be burgled . <PARA> barbara “ double take ” mikkelson
false	as sen . marco rubio ( r - fla .) came under scrutiny for his position on gun control in february 2018 following a mass school shooting in his state , a meme containing two quote ostensibly uttered by the senator about felons and their right to own guns gained renewed attention online : <PARA> this meme was originally posted to the now defunct facebook page “ stop the world the teabaggers want off ” in 2015 . this facebook group was well - known for creating fake quotes and attributing them to various politicians . a disclaimer in the group ’ s “ about ” section read : <PARA> we found no record of rubio uttering either of these phrases on the dates in the meme ( or at any other time ) in any credible publication . when we searched for rubio ’ s position on felons owning guns , we also found that the above quote may not represent the senator ’ s political stance on the issue . after the school shooting at sandy hook elementary school in 2012 , for instance , a spokesperson for rubio said that the senator was open to gun control measures that would keep weapons out of the hands of criminals : <PARA> rubio has not taken an official stance on restoring the voting rights of felons , as far as we can tell , but the senator ’ s state does prevent millions of former criminals from voting . furthermore , while campaigning for the senate in 2009 , rubio appeared to criticize his opponent , charlie crist , for “ restor ( ing ) the rights of felons to vote automatically in florida .” that was nearly a decade ago , however , and may not reflect rubio ’ s current stance on the issue .
mixture	fact check do blue lines painted on curbs signify a residence where a police officer can reliably find “ back - up ”? <PARA> mixture <PARA> origins : the period 2014 - 15 saw an ongoing public debate in the united states about police and policing : one faction held that corruption among law enforcement was rife and the cause of unnecessary civilian deaths at the hands of police , while another held that americans were increasingly at war with cops and unappreciative of their difficult jobs and their sacrifices . ( social media rumors about rudeness to police often seem to quickly follow high profile controversies involving police and race , such as the death of eric garner or the mckinney pool party incident .) <PARA> one thread of that debate suggested that the focus of reactive movements such as “ black lives matter ” was essentially attacking police . in response , on 9 september 2015 facebook user anthony welichko posted the example shown above , proposing an idea to support police that he dubbed the “ safe harbor initiative .” ( the idea later carried over to a number of september 2015 blog posts titled “ have you seen blue strip on curb ? here ’ s the incredible reason behind it .”) <PARA> the “ safe harbor ” proposal is clearly well - intentioned , and the person who asked social media users to share it meant only to encourage a broadly adoptable method of showing support for police officers . however , its functional application is somewhat unsound and ill - suited for the purpose it ’ s supposed to serve . <PARA> one issue with this proposal is that curb markers are often used by agencies such as public works departments to indicate locations work sites or important structural information . one example comes from bozeman , montana , where the very same signal illustrated in the “ safe harbor ” proposal was already in use : <PARA> bozeman is presumably not the only location wherein public works officials utilize painted strips of blue on curbs as internal signals . adopting that system to show moral support for police would create confusion over whether such markings were related to law enforcement protection or infrastructural projects . <PARA> additionally , blue strips painted on curbs are not particularly visible during non - daylight hours . it ’ s not reasonable to expect that police responding to evening or nighttime calls will first examine neighborhood curbsides with their flashlights to determine whether they have any community support in the area . <PARA> another matter is whether or not the proposal is ( or ever will be ) known outside of a few thousand shares on facebook . unless and until it is a widely used ( or at least widely recognized ) system , it will not be recognizable or useful to police . <PARA> finally , any form of reliance on such an informal and unofficial system is fraught with peril . would a person who was hostile to police likely have any compunctions about painting a marking on his curb in order to mislead cops into a false ( and potentially tragic ) sense of security ? if not , it ’ s unlikely that police would ever gain much benefit or place any reliance on the use of such symbols . <PARA> aside from all of those issues , just how are civilians supposed to provide “ back - up ” or “ have [ an officer ’ s back ]” during a hypothetical adversarial event or crime in progress ? police everywhere ( while typically grateful for public support ) are pretty firm about urging well - meaning civilians not to interfere with law enforcement activities . routinely , cops emphatically request that civilians present at crime scenes assist merely by staying out of the way and closely following their instructions , not by leaping in to serve as untrained “ back - up .” <PARA> police departments across the united states ( examples here , here , here , here , here , and here [ pdf , pdf ]) are consistent and firm in their guidance on this matter : civilians should not intervene with crimes in progress , especially when police are already on the scene . those who do may end up injured ( potentially fatally ), and untrained intervention poses severe risk to both other civilians and responding officers . this reason alone is enough to be extremely cautious about spreading the “ blue strip ” rumor , as the police require cooperation with the commands they ’ ve issued to bystanders more than they need encouragement for the public to act as crime scene cheerleaders . <PARA> while the “ safe harbor initiative ”/ blue strip curb paint idea was one borne of a desire to show support for police , for many reasons the proposed practice is likely to be of negligible benefit to any officers . most important , the message encourages a practice police departments universally disdain : civilian intervention in crimes in progress . well - meaning , untrained civilians who ’ ve taken it upon themselves to “ help ” the police are generally more of a burden and hindrance than anything else , so if you think police might need your help during an event , it ’ s best to wait for them to ask you for assistance . <PARA> it ’ s understandable that folks are moved to give back to hard - working police officers across the country , and one quora user ( who is also a retired cop ) offered a list of safe ways for civilians to do so without interfering with police activity : <PARA> “ slacktivist ” initiatives such as painting blue strips on curbs may give a temporary feeling of accomplishment , but those truly concerned with the plight of police officers would do better to donate to law enforcement charities or volunteer in an official capacity where civilian hands are needed ( and wanted ). last updated : 15 september 2015 <PARA> first published : 15 september 2015
false	messages offering a seemingly helpful heads - up about how to deal with a situation in which one is forced to hand over money withdrawn from an atm under duress began circulating on the internet in september 2006 : <PARA> however , the word “ seemingly ” applies in this case because the tip is only a chimera , as entering one ’ s personal identification number ( pin ) in reverse at automated teller machines ( atms ) does not automatically summon the police . <PARA> the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 compelled the federal trade commission to provide an analysis of any technology , either then currently available or under development , which would allow a distressed atm user to send an electronic alert to a law enforcement agency . the following statements were made in the ftc ’ s april 2010 report in response to that requirement : <PARA> ergo , there aren ’ t and haven ’ t ever been “ reverse pin ” technologies despite online claims dating to september 2006 that anyone being robbed at an atm simply had to enter his or her pin in reverse to summon help . <PARA> moreover , said that ftc report : <PARA> the reverse pin system was first imagined in 1994 and patented in 1998 by joseph zingher , a chicago businessman . his safetypin system would alert police that a crime was in progress when a cardholder at an atm keyed in the reverse of his personal identification numbers . the flip - flopped pin would serve as a “ panic code ” that sent a silent alarm to police to notify them that an atm customer was acting under duress . because palindromic pins ( e . g ., 2002 , 7337 , 4884 ) cannot be reversed , zingher ’ s system included work - arounds for such numeric combinations . <PARA> however , zingher had little success in interesting the banking community in safetypin despite his pitching it to them with great persistence over the years . he did in 2004 succeed in getting the illinois general assembly to adopt a “ reverse pin ” clause in sb 562 , but the final version of the bill watered down the wording so as to make banks ’ implementation of the system optional rather than mandatory : “ a terminal operated in this state may be designed and programmed so that when a consumer enters his or her personal identification number in reverse order , the terminal automatically sends an alarm to the local law enforcement agency having jurisdiction over the terminal location .” <PARA> in 2006 , michael boyd pressed the georgia state assembly to pass a law requiring banks to create atm panic codes that would operate the machines normally while also alerting police . his wife , kimberly boyd , was killed on 12 september 2005 after being carjacked by convicted sex offender brian o ’ neil clark and forced to withdraw cash at an atm . ( she died when clark crashed her suv while being followed by a civilian who ultimately shot clark to death afterwards .) such a bill was placed before the georgia senate on 29 december 2005 ( sb 379 ), but nothing came of it . <PARA> in 2004 , the kansas state senate sent to its financial institutions and insurance committee sb 333 , a bill that stated : “ any automated teller machine operated in this state shall be designed and programmed so that when a consumer enters such consumer ’ s personal identification number in reverse order , the automated teller machine automatically sends an alarm to the local law enforcement agency having jurisdiction over the automated teller machine location .” that bill died in committee that year . <PARA> all this talk of various bills in three different state legislatures may serve to obscure some of the more important points attaching to this issue , points that are key to making up one ’ s mind about whether having such a system in place is actually a good idea . <PARA> no one in the banking industry seems to want the technology . the banks argue against its implementation , not only on the basis of cost but also because they doubt such an alert would help anyone being coerced into making an atm withdrawal . even if police could be summoned via the keying of a special “ alert ” or “ panic ” code , they say , law enforcement would likely arrive long after victim and captor had departed . they have also warned of the very real possibility that victims ’ fumbling around while trying to trigger silent alarms could cause their captors to realize something was up and take those realizations out on their captives . <PARA> finally , there is the problem of atm customers ’ quickly conjuring up their accustomed pins in reverse : even in situations lacking added stress , mentally reconstructing one ’ s pin backwards is a difficult task for many people . add to that difficulty the terror of being in the possession of a violent and armed person , and precious few victims might be able to come up with reversed pins seamlessly enough to fool their captors into believing that everything was proceeding according to plan . as chuck stones of the kansas bankers association said in 2004 : “ i ’ m not sure anyone here could remember their pin numbers backward with a gun to their head .”
unproven	origins : lore has long had it that an act of spite led to the invention in 1853 of one of the most popular snack foods of all time . according to the oft - repeated tale , <PARA> potato chips were the innovation of george crum , head chef at moon ’ s lake house , a resort in saratoga springs , new york . on one fateful day , a customer had the temerity to complain that crum ’ s french fries were “ too thick and soggy ” and “ not salty enough .” the angered cook set out to wreak culinary vengeance — he sliced potatoes paper - thin , fried them to a singed crisped brown , salted the living daylights out of them , and dumped them in front of the hard - to - please diner . <PARA> the customer tried one , smiled , then helped himself to the rest of them . thus were born saratoga chips , as crum ’ s unintended invention came to be called . <PARA> according to a further bit of lore that has sprung up around this tale , the finicky customer in saratoga springs was none other than railroad magnate commodore cornelius vanderbilt . ( even among those who cherish the vengeful cook yarn , most dismiss the notion that vanderbilt was the hard - to - please diner .) <PARA> certain details argue against the vengeful cook legend . first , to the best of anyone ’ s knowledge , george crum never made the claim that he had invented the potato chip , let alone claimed the tale as his own — those assertions emerged only many years after his death . crum was , by some reports , the sort of cook that would have punished an overly demanding patron in the manner of the legend . he was also not a modest man . had one of his fits of pique resulted in a popular dish , it ’ s highly unlikely he ’ d have been humble about it . <PARA> second , in 1899 , while crum was still alive , his sister claimed in an interview to have been the one who invented potato chips . says dirk burhans of crunch ! a history of the great american potato chip : <PARA> the most credible version is that katie speck wicks invented the chip in an accident not dissimilar to the culinary misfire in which the brownie was born ( from a mix - up of cake and fudge ). “ aunt katie ,” who also worked at moon ’ s lake house , was frying crullers and peeling potatoes at the same time . a thin slice of potato found its way into the frying oil for the crullers , and katie fished it out . noticing the chip , crum tasted it and said , “ hm hm , that ’ s good . how did you make it ?” after katie described the accident , crum replied , “ that ’ s a good accident . we ’ ll have plenty of these .” <PARA> in 1917 wicks ’ obituary credited her as the inventor of the potato chip . <PARA> saratoga chips remained a local delicacy until the prohibition era , when an enterprising salesman named herman lay popularized the product throughout the southeast . the whispered assertions that potato chips were an aphrodisiac did not diminish his <PARA> sales . <PARA> americans reportedly eat an average of six pounds of potato chips per person each year . <PARA> barbara “ chip off the old blockhead ” mikkelson
false	a number of rumors have circulated about the titular purple dinosaur character in the children ’ s television show barney & friends since the program first aired in 1992 . we ’ ve examined several of these rumors ( e . g ., an actor in the barney suit did not hide cocaine in his tail ), we came across a new rumor in august 2016 holding that the character of barney was inspired by a serial kidnapper , rapist , and murderer from the 1930s : <PARA> there is no truth to this rumor . we found no record of a man named “ barney ” who dressed up in a dinosaur costume and kidnapped children in the 1930s , much less anything referencing the dinosaur character ’ s having been ( absurdly ) based on such a person . <PARA> the earliest iteration of this story we could uncover was posted to the wattpad web site in a collection of “ urban legends ”: <PARA> that version was accompanied by a disclaimer noting that the referenced entries “ are all urban legends . some are real , some aren ’ t . can you decide ?” <PARA> the true cuddly origins of barney & friends were explained in a 1992 chicago tribune article :

false	on 20 december 2017 , the conservative tribune web site made an outlandish attempt to link purported “ animal brothers ” to a surging migrant population in the country : <PARA> this article cites two stories in its attempt to connect these two supposed phenomena : a 2013 daily mail report about lax animal protection laws , and a 2017 reuters article about germany ’ s migrant population . these two articles are not related , and the information in the daily mail article is both exaggerated and outdated . <PARA> the daily mail published an article claiming that some animal brothels , or erotic zoos , had opened in germany after people realized that the country ’ s animal protection laws didn ’ t explicitly ban sex with animals . this article made no mention of migrants being a cause of this problem and the bestiality loophole was closed in 2013 as german lawmakers voted to criminalize “ using an animal for personal sexual activities ”: <PARA> a german court also upheld the country ’ s ban on bestiality after a 2016 legal challenge . <PARA> the daily mail ’ s claim that “ animal brothels ” were operating in germany in 2013 may also be an exaggeration . the evidence that these so - called brothels exist appears to be a single quote from a state animal protection officer named madeleine martin . however , she did not describe having discovered businesses where people pay to have sex with animals — rather , she described a group of men sneaking onto a farm to abuse sheep and another man who distributed online pictures and instructions for sex with animals . <PARA> in other words , a large portion of the conservative tribune ’ s article was based on a years - old article that contained outdated and misleading information . <PARA> the second part of this claim — that germany ’ s migrant population hit 22 percent — is misquoted information from a genuine reuters article that was published in 2016 — three years after the daily mail article claiming that “ animal brothels ” exist . <PARA> the reuters article does not say that 22 percent of germany ’ s population are migrants . rather , it says : <PARA> a “ second generation immigrant ” is someone born in the country that their parents immigrated to . in this case , it also includes people with only one parent who was born outside germany . these people would hardly be considered “ migrants ,” so the conservative tribune is incorrect in saying that migrants make up 22 percent of the german population . <PARA> the conservative tribune further misrepresented the makeup of these migrants in their fear - mongering introductory paragraph which stated that a “ flood of refugees fleeing jihadist - filled war zones in the middle east and north africa ” poured into germany . although germany did take in a large number of refugees , the reuters article noted that the “ vast majority of the immigrant population . . . had links to other european countries .” <PARA> the conservative tribune acknowledged this later in their article : <PARA> the conservative tribune focused on immigrants from outside europe in order to foment racial prejudice . their article attempts to link bestiality to non - europeans . however , this transparent attempt to spark fear and hatred is based on false information .
false	the official guest list for the royal wedding of britain ’ s prince harry and meghan markle had not been released as of early december 2017 , but that didn ’ t stop disreputable web sites from inventing politically - charged stories about who would and wouldn ’ t be invited . <PARA> the pro - trump fake news site just news usa reported on 3 december 2017 that despite “ kissing up ” to the royal family and trying to “ sneak ” an invitation to harry ’ s wedding , former united states president and first lady barack and michelle obama had been “ personally removed ” from the guest list by queen elizabeth : <PARA> several other sites , including the consistently unreliable yournewswire . com , published slightly rearranged versions of the same article . for example : <PARA> there was no basis in fact for any of these claims . as of 30 november ( just a few days before these reports began appearing ), word from kensington palace was that the guest list was still “ in the early stages of being compiled ,” according to the telegraph , and the royal betrothed would have “ primary input ” into who would be on that list . no mainstream news sources in england or anywhere else reported that the obamas were on the outs with queen elizabeth , nor that the queen intended to disinvite them or other potential wedding guests . <PARA> as a matter of fact , if anyone were likely to be disinvited , it would probably have been president trump , judging from the telegraph ‘ s report , for two reasons : one , because it would go against the established precedent , which is not to invite sitting u . s . presidents to british royal weddings ; and two , because bride - to - be meghan markle , who is an american , is not a big fan of trump , whom she has called “ misogynistic ” and “ divisive .” <PARA> the obamas , on the other hand , have enjoyed a comparatively warm relationship with the royal family ever since 2009 , when the then - first lady broke with protocol and hugged the queen during their first meeting . barack obama was seen hanging out with groom - to - be prince harry as recently as may 2017 : <PARA> a 27 november 2017 article in newsweek told a story very different from what would be reported by just news usa and other fake news sites days later : <PARA> in the end , neither president trump nor president obama was invited , for reasons explained by the palace :
false	the legend of denmark ’ s king christian x and his wearing of the yellow star is our most stirring example of non - violent opposition to evil : ordinary citizens ( following the example of a courageous leader ) defy their military overlords by selflessly putting themselves in harm ’ s way to prevent the persecution of a defenseless minority . if only more people exhibited such moral fortitude nowadays , we reason , the world would be a much better place . perhaps if more people had exhibited such moral courage back then , we think , the holocaust might never have happened . <PARA> although the danes did undertake heroic efforts to shelter their jews and help them escape from the nazis , there is no real - life example of the actions described by this legend . danish citizens never wore the yellow badge , nor did king christian ever threaten to don it himself . in fact , danish jews never wore the yellow badge either ( except for the few who were finally deported to concentration camps ), nor did german officials ever issue an order requiring danish jews to display it . <PARA> we will assume everyone is familiar with the systematic persecution of jews instituted in germany after adolph hitler became chancellor in 1933 , and the subsequent imposition of laws requiring jewish - owned shops to be identified as such with prominent signs ; passports and ration cards held by jews to be stamped with the letter ‘ j ’; and jewish concentration camp inmates to wear yellow - and - red six - pointed stars . ( surprisingly , it was not until late 1941 that the display on clothing of a yellow star of david with the word ‘ jude ’ printed on it by jews was mandated by law in germany .) denmark entered the tragic saga on the morning of 9 april 1940 , when german troops overran the country and an ultimatum was delivered : if denmark offered no resistance , germany would respect danish political independence . the danish government and monarch , with no real options , quickly capitulated , and the five - year long occupation of denmark began . <PARA> the occupied engaged in symbolic gestures of defiance against their occupiers , such as wearing four coins tied together with red and white ribbons in their buttonholes . ( red and white are the danish colors , and four coins totalling nine ore represented the date of the occupation , april 9 .) tales of king christian ’ s snubbing of hitler and the nazis ( some true and some apocryphal ) began to circulate . when hitler sent a letter of congratulations to king christian x on the latter ’ s 70th birthday in september 1942 , the monarch ’ s brief response (“ my best thanks ”) was taken as an insult by hitler , who recalled and replaced the german ambassador in denmark . <PARA> a swedish newspaper cartoon ( possibly the origin of this legend ) depicted the monarch talking with the former danish prime minster , who asks him , “ what are we going to do , your majesty , if scavenius makes all the jews wear yellow stars ?” ( erik scavenius was the danish foreign minister who became prime minister at the insistence of the germans after the danish government resigned in 1943 .) the king responds by asserting , “ we ’ ll all have to wear yellow stars .” <PARA> matters came to a head in denmark during the summer of 1943 when strikes and other overt resistance activities against the germans resulted in a demand from hitler that the danish government declare a state of emergency . the government refused to comply , resigning in protest , and the german commander - in - chief , hermann von hanneken , imposed martial law . the arrest and deportation of danish jews was finally ordered and carried out on 2 october 1943 , but by then nearly all the jews in copenhagen had already been warned and gone into hiding while government officials secretly negotiated an agreement with sweden to receive them . <PARA> only 284 of an estimated 7 , 000 jews in the area were rounded up , and over the next several weeks most of them made their precarious way to sweden on fishing boats , private vessels , and any other type of floating craft that could undertake the journey . fewer than 500 danish jews were deported to the theresienstadt concentration camp in czechoslovakia , and nearly 90 % of them survived to return to denmark after the war . ( only these few hundred danes who were sent to theresienstadt were made to wear yellow stars identifying them as jews .) <PARA> although this legend may not be true in its specifics , it was certainly true enough in spirit . the rescue of several thousand danish jews was accomplished through the efforts of “ thousands of policemen , government officials , physicians , and persons of all walks of life .” the efforts to save danish jews may not have had the flair of the “ yellow star ” legend , and they may not have required quite so many citizens to visibly oppose an occupying army , but those who were rescued undoubtedly preferred substance to style . <PARA> variations :

( the other claimant in that long - ago case , david jung , founder of the los angeles - based hong kong noodle company , came from canton , <PARA> china .) <PARA> mock trial result or not , it ’ s impossible to authoritatively state precisely where , when , or by whom the fortune cookie was invented . certainly by world war ii these predictive desserts were commonplace offerings in chinese restaurants in san francisco , and from there they fanned out to the rest of the country . yet the details of how they came to be a staple in san francisco are still murky . many fortune cookie origin tales are told as part of particular families ’ histories , most involving an asian immigrant introducing the cookie somewhere in california prior to world war i . <PARA> however , what cannot be denied is fortune cookies didn ’ t originally come from china . prior to the late - 1980s , visitors to that land intent upon finding “ real ” chinese fortune cookies came away sadly disappointed , as the confections were virtually unknown there . in 1989 an entrepreneur in hong kong began importing fortune cookies and selling them as luxury items in a chain of fancy delicatessens , advertising them as “ genuine american fortune cookies .” in 1992 brooklyn - based wonton food expanded its existing fortune cookie business into china , building the very first fortune cookie factory in that land , but that project was short - lived . said richard leung , the company ’ s vice - president : “ it seemed like a good idea at the time , but it just didn ’ t pan out . fortune cookies are too american .” <PARA> barbara “ apple pie logic ” mikkelson

false	on 28 february 2017 , the underground report web site published an article positing that a florida drug trafficker who had been pardoned by president obama was re - arrested three months later on charges that he had murdered his girlfriend : <PARA> none of this was true . no one by the name of james g . winters was pardoned by president obama or arrested on murder charges in florida in february 2017 . the photograph of “ james g . winters ” that accompanied the article was actually a picture of a man named avery draughty , who was arrested in california in march 2015 and charged with a killing that had taken place over a year earlier . <PARA> the only source reporting this information was the underground report , a known fake news site . so known , in fact , that at the foot of every article the site ’ s creation has since added a link to a page explaining his deliberate spread of fabricated reports ( and the public ’ s reception of them ):
true	origins : the <PARA> item quoted above is indeed a relatively faithful transcript of candidate john glenn ’ s remarks during a 1974 debate with howard metzenbaum for the democratic nomination to a u . s . senate seat , but the circumstances that prompted glenn ’ s words were not quite as they ’ re made out to be here . <PARA> the 1970 democratic primary in ohio for a u . s . senate seat pitted two men who were just embarking on long careers in national politics : businessman howard metzenbaum vs . former marine pilot and astronaut john glenn . although glenn — a hero since his mercury 6 flight eight years earlier had made him the first american astronaut to orbit the earth — was the favorite , he lost the nomination to metzenbaum following a campaign remarkable for its rancor , and glenn came away from the experience bitter over a false rumor , attributed to a metzenbaum aide , that he and his wife were on the verge of a divorce . metzenbaum lost the general election to republican robert taft , jr ., but he was appointed to the u . s . senate in 1974 when ohio ’ s other senator , william b . saxbe , resigned to accept a nomination as u . s . attorney general , setting the stage for glenn to challenge metzenbaum once again in the 1974 democratic <PARA> primary . <PARA> the candidates in the 1974 race were even more contentious than they had been four years earlier . metzenbaum took to referring to glenn disdainfully as “ colonel glenn ” to emphasize his military background ( glenn was a world war ii and korean war veteran and had retired as a colonel from the marine corps in 1965 after twenty - two years of service ) — today military service is generally considered a positive attribute in a politician , but in 1974 america had just ended its long and controversial involvement in vietnam , and the military was viewed with suspicion and distrust , especially by the large portion of the “ baby boom ” generation that had reached voting age . <PARA> a few days before a may 3 debate between the candidates at the cleveland city club , metzenbaum ( an entrepreneur who had created the sun newspapers chain in the 1960s and had co - founded apcoa , one of the nation ’ s largest parking companies ) charged that “ colonel glenn ” had never “ met a payroll ,” implying that glenn ’ s background as a career military man meant he was lacking in the real - world business experience a u . s . senator should possess . ( metzenbaum ’ s claim wasn ’ t quite accurate : after his retirement from the marine corps , glenn had held a position as a business executive with royal crown cola and had served both as a member of the board of directors and as president of royal crown international .) <PARA> metzenbaum ’ s comment was widely publicized and interpreted by many — including glenn himself — as a slam that glenn had “ never held a ( real ) job ” ( even though metzenbaum hadn ’ t actually used those words ), and glenn went into the cleveland debate a few days later well - prepared to answer the charges . although metzenbaum didn ’ t raise the “ job ” issue during the debate , glenn nonetheless seized the opportunity to launch into his carefully - crafted “ i have held a job ” retort , invoking stirring images of motherhood , sacrifice , and patriotism . although it was a rehearsed speech rather than the impromptu response legend has since made it out to be , glenn ’ s stinging rebuke to metzenbaum was a masterful stroke that swung momentum in his favor . he bested metzenbaum by 8 percentage points in the primary and was elected to the u . s . senate in the general election , carrying all 88 counties in ohio in the process . <PARA> both men went on to enjoy long political careers , glenn serving four consecutive terms in the u . s . senate before retiring in 1998 and metzenbaum winning election to the u . s . senate three times himself , but the timeless lesson of that 1974 campaign will outlive them both : you impugn the reputation of a national hero at your own peril — especially when he has better speechwriters than you do . <PARA> update : in 2005 , someone prefaced the john glenn / howard metzenbaum article with the following item about iraq . this addendum has nothing to do with john glenn — it ’ s an anonymous piece that has been floating around the internet since 2004 , but because it has been tacked onto an article about glenn , readers have been misled into thinking that it is a transcription of something he said : <PARA> the right perspective : <PARA> what senator john glenn said , scroll down . <PARA> things that make you think a little ........ <PARA> there were 39 combat related killings in iraq during january .... <PARA> in the fair city of detroit there were 35 murders in the month of january . <PARA> that ’ s just one american city , about as deadly as the entire war torn country of iraq . <PARA> when some claim president bush shouldn ’ t have started this war , state the following ... <PARA> fdr ... led us into world war ii . germany never attacked us : japan did . from 1941 - 1945 , 450 , 000 lives were lost , an average of 112 , 500 per year . <PARA> truman ... finished that war and started one in korea , north korea never attacked us . from 1950 - 1953 , 55 , 000 lives were lost , an average of 18 , 334 per year . <PARA> john f . kennedy ... started the vietnam conflict in 1962 . vietnam never attacked us . johnson ... turned vietnam into a quagmire . from 1965 - 1975 , 58 , 000 lives were lost , an average of 5 , 800 per year . <PARA> clinton ... went to war in bosnia without un or french consent , bosnia never attacked us . he was offered osama bin laden ’ s head on a platter three times by sudan and did nothing . osama has attacked us on multiple occasions . <PARA> in the years since terrorists attacked us president bush has .... liberated two countries ; crushed the taliban ; crippled al - qaida ; put nuclear inspectors in libya , iran , and north korea without firing a shot ; and captured a terrorist who slaughtered 300 , 000 of his own people . <PARA> the democrats are complaining about how long the war is taking , but ... it took less time to take iraq than it took janet reno to take the branch davidian compound - that was a 51 - day operation . <PARA> we ’ ve been looking for evidence of chemical weapons in iraq for less time than it took hillary clinton to find the rose law firm billing records . <PARA> it took less time for the 3rd infantry division and the marines to destroy the medina republican guard than it took ted kennedy to call the police after his oldsmobile sank at chapaquiddick . <PARA> it took less time to take iraq than it took to count the votes in florida !!!!

mixture	the unsourced “ abraham lincoln didn ’ t quit ” list reproduced above is a ubiquitous piece of american historical glurge that has been printed in countless magazines and newspaper columns over the decades , including an appearance in a 1967 reader ’ s digest collection of humor and anecdotes . it is now a favorite feature of inspirational e - mail lists , web sites , and chicken soup for the soul - type books , and it exemplifies what is so very wrong about turning history into glurge . abraham lincoln is the mythical , towering figure of american history , and whatever one thinks of his accomplishments , he was indeed a fascinating character . he truly fulfilled the “ anyone can make it in america ” ethos ; he was the man of little means or education , born in a one - room log cabin , honest and hard - working , who overcame numerous obstacles and failures to become president of the united states when the nation was confronted with its gravest crisis . <PARA> one would think the facts of lincoln ’ s life should be a good enough story for anyone , but no , apparently the truth isn ’ t sufficiently inspirational ; it has to be shaped and molded into glurge that depicts lincoln as a man who endured constant failure and defeat from the time he was born until he was elected president . lincoln certainly survived his fair share of hardship and setbacks , but he also was remarkably successful in many different endeavors throughout his lifetime . let ’ s take a look at what this glurge leaves out : <PARA> 1816 : his family was forced out of their home . he had to work to support them . <PARA> life on the american frontier in the early 19th century was no picnic for anyone : it required hours of back - breaking toil and drudgery day in and day out . in the context of their time , however , the lincolns lived under rather unremarkable circumstances . <PARA> the statement that the lincolns were “ forced out of their home ” in 1816 isn ’ t completely false , but it is somewhat misleading because it implies they were suddenly and involuntarily uprooted from their home , with no warning and no place to go . abraham lincoln ’ s father , thomas , had owned farmland in hardin county , kentucky , since the early 1800s , and he left kentucky and moved his family across the ohio river to indiana in 1816 for two primary reasons : <PARA> with plenty of land available in neighboring indiana , a territory where slavery had been excluded by the northwest ordinance , and where the government guaranteed buyers clear title to their property , thomas lincoln opted to move rather than to spend time and money fighting over the title to his kentucky farm . so , in a moderate sense the lincolns could be said to have been “ forced out of their home ,” but that process did not happen abruptly , and they opted to leave because better opportunities awaited them elsewhere . <PARA> the other part of this statement , that a seven - year - old abraham lincoln “ had to work to support ” his family , is also misleading . young abraham did not have to take an outside job lest his poor family sink into financial ruin . like nearly all farm children of his era , lincoln was expected to perform whatever chores and tasks he was physically capable of handling around the farm . if abraham worked harder and longer than most other children , it was not because the lincolns ’ circumstances were extraordinarily difficult , but because lincoln was exceptionally tall and strong for his age . <PARA> 1818 : his mother died . <PARA> this statement , at least , is no embellishment . lincoln ’ s mother , nancy , did die of “ milk sickness “ in 1818 , when abraham was only nine years old . a mother ’ s death is a tragedy for any child , and it was a special hardship for a struggling farm family . <PARA> 1831 : failed in business . <PARA> the statement that lincoln “ failed in business ” in 1831 is another misleading claim , because it implies that he was the owner or operator of the failed business , or at least was otherwise responsible for its failure . none of this is true . lincoln left his father ’ s home for good in 1831 and , along with his cousin john hanks , took a flatboat full of provisions down the mississippi river from illinois to new orleans on behalf of a “ bustling , none too scrupulous businessman ” named denton offutt . offutt planned to open a general store , and he promised to make lincoln its manager when abraham returned from new orleans . lincoln operated the store as offutt ’ s clerk and assistant for several months ( and by all accounts did a fine job of it ) until offutt , a poor businessman , overextended himself financially and ran it into the ground . thus by the spring of 1832 lincoln had indeed “ lost his job ,” but not because he had “ failed in business .” <PARA> 1832 : ran for state legislature — lost . <PARA> lincoln did run for the illinois state legislature in 1832 , although as lincoln biographer david herbert donald noted , “ the post he was seeking was not an elevated one ... [ legislators ] dealt mostly with such issues as whether cattle had to be fenced in or could enjoy free range .” lincoln finished eighth in a field of thirteen ( with the top four vote - getters becoming legislators ). however , this same year lincoln also achieved something of which he was very proud , when the members of a volunteer militia company he had joined selected him as their captain . lincoln said many years later that this was “ a success which gave me more pleasure than any i have had since .” ( he also noted later in his career that his defeat in the 1832 legislative election was the only time he “ was ever beaten on a direct vote of the people .”) <PARA> 1832 : also lost his job — wanted to go to law school but couldn ’ t get in . <PARA> as noted above , lincoln had actually “ lost his job ” ( such as it was ) in 1831 , and the notion that in 1832 lincoln “ wanted to go to law school but couldn ’ t get in ” ( why he couldn ’ t get in remains unspecified ) is both inaccurate and an anachronism . lincoln did eventually become a lawyer , and he accomplished the feat in the manner typical of his time and place : not by attending law school , but by reading law books and observing court sessions . he was indeed interested in becoming a lawyer as early as 1832 , but , as lincoln biographer donald wrote , “ on reflection he concluded that he needed a better education to succeed .” <PARA> 1833 : borrowed some money from a friend to begin a business and by the end of the year he was bankrupt . he spent the next 17 years of his life paying off this debt . <PARA> lincoln and william f . berry , a corporal from lincoln ’ s militia company , purchased a general store in new salem , illinois , in 1833 . ( lincoln had no money for his half ; he didn ’ t technically “ borrow the money from a friend ” but instead signed a promissory note with one of the previous owners for his share .) lincoln and berry were competing against a larger , well - organized store in the same town ; their outfit did little business , and within a short time it had “ winked out .” <PARA> the debt on the store became due the following year , and since lincoln was unable to pay off his note , his possessions were seized by the sheriff . moreover , when lincoln ’ s former partner died with no assets soon afterwards , lincoln insisted upon assuming his partner ’ s half of the debt as well , even though he was not legally obligated to do so . exactly how long it took lincoln to pay off this debt ( which he jokingly referred to as his “ national debt ”) in its entirety is unknown . it did take him several years , but not seventeen ; nor , as this statement implies , was he completely financially encumbered until it was paid in full . within a few months of the store ’ s failure lincoln had obtained a position as the new salem postmaster , and by 1835 he was earning money both as a surveyor and as a state legislator . <PARA> 1834 : ran for state legislature again — won . <PARA> in 1834 lincoln was again one of thirteen candidates running for a seat in the state legislature , and this time he won , securing the second - highest vote total among the field . <PARA> 1835 : was engaged to be married , sweetheart died and his heart was broken . <PARA> much about lincoln ’ s relationship with new salem resident ann rutledge remains a mystery , and several aspects of it — including whether or not they were actually engaged ( at the time they met , ann was betrothed to someone else ) — are based more on speculation than documented fact . whatever the exact nature of their relationship , however , her death in the summer of 1835 affected lincoln profoundly . <PARA> 1836 : had a total nervous breakdown and was in bed for six months . <PARA> whether lincoln experienced a “ total nervous breakdown ” in the aftermath of ann rutledge ’ s death is debatable , but the notion that he somehow found time to stay “ in bed for six months ” is not . after ann ’ s funeral he spent a few weeks visiting an old friend , and within a month of her death he had resumed his occasional surveying duties . he surveyed the nearby town of petersburg in february 1836 , undertook a strenuous two - month campaign for re - election during the summer , and served in the state legislature throughout the year . all of this would have been impossible for a man who spent “ six months in bed .” <PARA> 1838 : sought to become speaker of the state legislature — defeated . <PARA> by the time of the 1838 - 39 legislative session , lincoln had twice been an unsuccessful whig candidate for the position of speaker of the illinois house of representatives . this was a relatively minor political setback , however , and no mention is made here of the fact that by 1838 he was one of the most experienced members of the legislature , or of any of the other notable successes he achieved between 1834 and 1838 , namely : <PARA> 1840 : sought to become elector — defeated . <PARA> this statement is erroneous . lincoln was named as a presidential elector at the illinois state whig convention on 8 october 1839 , and he campaigned as a whig elector during the 1840 , 1844 , 1852 , and 1856 presidential elections ( skipping the 1848 campaign because he was serving in congress ). <PARA> 1843 : ran for congress — lost . <PARA> one could claim this as a lincoln failure in that he wanted to be a congressman and failed to achieve that goal , but it is technically inaccurate to claim that he “ ran for congress ” in 1843 and lost : the election was held in 1844 , and lincoln was not a candidate in that election . lincoln ’ s failure to achieve his party ’ s nomination at the may 1843 whig district convention is undoubtedly what is referred to here . <PARA> 1846 : ran for congress again — this time he won — went to washington and did a good job . <PARA> lincoln won a seat as an illinois representative to the u . s . congress in 1846 . <PARA> 1848 : ran for re - election to congress — lost . <PARA> lincoln did not “ lose ” the 1848 election . he did not run for re - election because whig policy at the time specified that party members should step aside after serving one term to allow other members to take their turns at holding office . lincoln , a faithful party member , complied . <PARA> 1849 : sought the job of land officer in his home state — rejected . <PARA> the position referred to here was commissioner of the general land office , a federal position , not a state one , and one that came with a fair amount of power and patronage . since lincoln ’ s term in congress was about to expire , his friends urged him to apply for this post , but lincoln was reluctant to give up his law career . he finally agreed to apply for the job when the choice was deadlocked between two other illinois candidates and it looked like the appointment might therefore go to a compromise candidate from outside of illinois . whigs from northern illinois then decided that too many appointments were going to party members from other parts of the state and put up their own candidate against lincoln . the choice was left to the secretary of the interior , who selected the other candidate . <PARA> 1854 : ran for senate of the united states — lost . <PARA> in lincoln ’ s time , u . s . senators were not elected through direct popular vote ; they were appointed by state legislatures . in illinois , voters cast ballots only for state legislators , and the general assembly of the state legislature then selected nominees to fill open u . s . senate seats . so , in 1854 ( and again in 1856 ) lincoln was not technically running for the senate ; he was campaigning on behalf of whig candidates for state legislature seats all throughout illinois . nonetheless , after the 1854 state election , lincoln made it known that he sought the open u . s . senate seat for illinois . the first ballot of a divided general assembly was taken in february 1855 , and lincoln received the most votes but was six votes shy of the requisite majority . when the process remained deadlocked after another eight ballots , lincoln withdrew from the race to lend his support to another candidate and ensure that the senate seat did not go to a pro - slavery democrat . <PARA> 1856 : sought the vice - presidential nomination at his party ’ s national convention — got less than 100 votes . <PARA> this statement is both misleading and inaccurate . lincoln did not “ seek ” the vice - presidential nomination at the 1856 republican national convention in philadelphia ; his name was put into nomination by the illinois delegation after most national delegates were already committed to other candidates . ( lincoln himself was back in illinois , not at the convention , and did not know he had been nominated until friends brought him the news .) nonetheless , in an informal ballot , lincoln received 110 votes out of 363 , not at all a bad showing for someone who was little known outside his home state . <PARA> 1858 : ran for u . s . senate again — again he lost . <PARA> again , lincoln was not directly campaigning for a senate seat , although it was a foregone conclusion that he would be the republicans ’ choice to take stephen douglas ’ u . s . senate seat if his party won control of the illinois state legislature . lincoln actually bested douglas in the sense that republican legislative candidates statewide received slightly over 50 % of the popular vote , but the republicans failed to gain control of the state legislature , and douglas therefore retained his seat in the senate . <PARA> 1860 : elected president of the united states . <PARA> and again in 1864 . a pretty good ending for someone who wasn ’ t quite the perennial failure this glurge makes him out to be .
true	in february 2017 , shane patrick boyle started a gofundme campaign to raise money for “ a month of insulin .” a few weeks later , he died after developing diabetic ketoacidosis . although several local outlets reported on boyle ’ s death at the time , it wasn ’ t until november 2017 that boyle ’ s story reached many readers , thanks in part to a facebook post from united states sen . bernie sanders linking to an article in the nation about the rising cost of insulin : <PARA> in addition to highlighting the sad circumstances surrounding boyle ’ s death , the nation also pointed to alec raeshawn smith , a 26 - year - old who died in june after he lost his insurance and started to ration his insulin : <PARA> the deaths of smith and boyle and their reported struggles with health insurance were met with skepticism by some readers . others encountered this news on social media , where it was shared with incomplete or incorrect information . for instance , comedian david anthony conflated the deaths of these two individuals when he wrote that a 26 - year - old had started a gofundme to get insulin : <PARA> alec raeshawn smith was 26 years old at the time of his death ; however , we have not been able to find anything to indicate that he had set up a gofundme campaign to raise money for insulin .

unproven	origins : when philips and sony began collaborating on the development of the compact disc , philips produced an 11 . 5cm , 14 - bit prototype that held <PARA> 60 minutes ’ worth of music sony president norio ohga , however , felt that this format was too limited and insisted on a 12cm , 16 - bit format that offered 74 minutes ’ worth of music . various reasons have been offered to explain why the 74 - minute length was chosen , all of them involving beethoven ’ s 9th symphony : that length was chosen because beethoven ’ s 9th was ohga ’ s favorite piece of music , because it was sony chairman akio morita ’ s wife ’ s favorite piece of music , or because conductor herbert von karajan ( who recorded for the polygram label , a subsidiary of philips electronics ) “ demanded ” it . ( herbert von karajan lent tremendous prestige to the cd by participating in the 1981 vienna press conference held by sony to announce the company ’ s prototype , and his recording of the 9th with the berlin philharmonic is often claimed to be the reference recording that was used to determine what the cd ’ s maximum length should be .) <PARA> the multiplicity of reasons given for the 74 - minute choice should in itself be cause for skepticism . ohga has indicated only that he felt philips ’ original format was not ideal , and that a 74 - minute cd “ would be able to encompass an entire opera or all of beethoven ’ s 9th symphony .” <PARA> since this accommodation could be accomplished by expanding the disc ’ s size from 11 . 5cm to 12cm and still maintain ohga ’ s standard of “ portability ” ( i . e ., able to fit into a suit pocket ), the change was made . there is no evidence to indicate what ohga or sony would have done had this expanded size still not been able to hold all of beethoven ’ s 9th . ( would they have gone with a 12cm , 14 - bit disc instead , for example ?) <PARA> the fact remains that nearly all modern - day recordings of beethoven ’ s 9th symphony ( including the von karajan recording with the berlin philharmonic often cited as the reference recording ) are several minutes shorter than the initial 74 - minute maximum length of a cd . whether sony simply chose the longer of two discrete lengths ( which , fortunately , was long enough to accommodate beethoven ’ s 9th ) or whether they chose a specific length from a range of possibilities is unknown . <PARA> sightings : this item turned up as a question on the 17 january 2001 episode of the game show who wants to be a millionaire ?

( wdio retracted the story the next night .) the duluth news tribune was innundated by the tale as folks called and wrote to ask about a particular canal park restaurant they ’ d heard had turned away a u . s . marine in uniform , the restaurant being the kind of funky place folks against the war might frequent . in another version , several army reservists in uniform were said to have been somehow dishonored at another trendy canal park eatery . in still another iteration , someone in a military uniform was verbally abused in the target parking lot . <PARA> jim heffernan , a writer for the duluth news tribune , asked readers who could prove any of the incidents being described had actually taken place to contact him , put him in touch with the serviceman who had been turned away , or at least give him the serviceman ’ s name . a week later he penned a followup article stating no one had come forward . <PARA> as for the hilton head , south carolina , version of the legend , we spoke to the manager of the wild wing cafe about the rumor . he said the story was “ a complete lie ” and that “ we support our troops 100 %”, adding that they ’ d “ had a group of 15 marines in just the other night .” he provided us with a copy of the denial the owners of the establishment have circulated to those who have asked about the rumor . because it ’ s incredibly lengthy , we won ’ t quote all of it here , but here are some key excerpts from it : <PARA> over the years wild wing cafe has been proud to be supportive of the community . we have sponsored your teams and schools , your kids and their organizations . now we are asking for your support . when someone tells you that wild wing cafe won ’ t serve the military as a protest to this war , tell them in no uncertain terms , that is a lie . <PARA> during our conversation with the manager of the wild wing cafe , he described another recent incident which could also have been the starting point for this rumor . five guys not in uniform but sporting buzz cuts , and one with his arm in a cast , left the big bamboo cafe ( the bar across the street ) without paying their tab . the bartender there telephoned wild wing and asked them to be on the lookout for those fellows . the fivesome came into wild wing , whereupon the bartender told them about the abandoned tab across the street and said he ’ d call over to big bamboo to see if it couldn ’ t be straightened out . while he was making the call , the five young men disappeared . <PARA> it ’ s possible either of the two incidents being described could have touched off a yarn about servicemen being shunned by those rabidly against the war with iraq . these are emotionally charged times , impelling many to perceive slights where none exist or to misparse events so as to transform a marine turned away for not presenting a valid id into someone given the boot by folks vehement in their opposition to the war . so many of the rumors of our times are the result of honest mishearings , misunderstandings , or misrememberings of real events or accounts of them that this type of shift — especially when fevers are running high — is almost to be expected . <PARA> we expect many more communities to be visited by the “ shunned serviceman ” story before it fully runs it course . it is , after all , the sort of shocking tale those angered by the anti - war movement will find great comfort in because it vilifies those who decry the current military action by presenting them as being against not only the war , but also against the men and women who are willing to risk their lives in the service of their country . <PARA> barbara “ slight readjustment ” mikkelson
false	shortly after the deaths of music icons david bowie , lemmy , and glenn frey , a rumor started circulating that rolling stones ’ guitarist keith richards had passed away . <PARA> this untrue rumor stemmed from a misunderstanding of two literary components : reading comprehension and satire . on 13 january 2016 , an entertainment web site called the nevada county scooper published a fake news article claiming that keith richards had not been found dead : <PARA> the nevada county scooper penned the above - quoted article in a manner reminiscent of a news story reporting on the death of a celebrity . while the entertainment site never wrote that richards had been found dead , the manner in which the above - quoted article was written fooled some people into believing that the iconic guitarist had passed away . <PARA> the above - quoted article is a work of fiction . while the nevada county scooper correctly ( although confusedly ) wrote that keith richards had not passed away , the story about medics being called to the hotel only to be surprised by a living , breathing musician is completely made up .
true	several television series aired episodes that were broadcast as part of the shows ’ regular network runs but for one reason or another were omitted from the syndication packages subsequently sold to local stations , thereby creating “ lost ” episodes that were not seen again by the general public for many years . <PARA> an episode filmed for the seventh season of the suspense series alfred hitchcock presents ( 1961 - 62 ) reversed that phenomenon : deemed unsuitable by a sponsor of the show , one installment of the program was never given a network airing and was not seen by television viewers until the series was sold into syndication . <PARA> the episode that caused the controversy was entitled “ the sorcerer ’ s apprentice ,” adapted for television by psycho author robert bloch from his 1949 short story of the same name . the plot involved a transient , mentally underdeveloped young man named hugo who was found and taken in by victor sadini , a magician performing with a traveling carnival . hugo quickly became enchanted with sadini ’ s magic act , which culminated with sadini ’ s sawing his wife irene in half with a buzzsaw and then restoring her to wholeness . <PARA> unfortunately , hugo ’ s arrival complicated an already messy love triangle : hugo developed a protective crush on irene , who was herself carrying on an affair with george , another carnival performer . taking advantage of hugo ’ s simple - mindedness , irene sought to resolve the situation by convincing hugo that sadini was mistreating her , and that if he ( hugo ) could gain possession of sadini ’ s magic wand , he would then have the same magical powers as her husband . <PARA> an enraged hugo solved the problem as expected , killing sadini and then paying irene a visit proudly garbed in the dead magician ’ s costume . but when irene spurned hugo ’ s advances , they struggled and hugo knocked her out . irene awoke to find herself strapped into the sawing - in - half trick ’ s prop box as the buzzsaw cut into it , while a gleefully triumphant hugo — convinced that his possession of sadini ’ s wand endowed him with a magical ability to pull off the trick successfully — pled with the terrified woman to “ smile ! smile !” <PARA> if the denouement of the episode wasn ’ t obvious to some viewers , it was made clear in host alfred hitchcock ’ s wry closing narration : <PARA> although the episode as filmed displayed no gore and left the details of the climax to viewers ’ imaginations , one of the series ’ sponsors nonetheless found the concept of “ the sorcerer ’ s apprentice ” to be too horrifying and protested against the episode ’ s airing : <PARA> since alfred hitchcock presents shifted formats ( it expanded from a half - hour to a full hour and was renamed the alfred hitchcock hour ) at the conclusion of the season in which “ the sorcerer ’ s apprentice ” was to have aired , the episode was simply skipped by the network , the only such occurrence in the history of the series . however , “ the sorcerer ’ s apprentice ” was included in the syndication package of half - hour alfred hitchcock presents episodes sold to local stations and thus escaped the fate of becoming a truly “ lost ” episode . <PARA> writer robert bloch later recalled of the brouhaha :
false	examples : [ collected via e - mail , august 2014 ] <PARA> back on august 5th , major general harold greene was killed in afghanistan , the victim of an insider attack . he was the first general killed in a combat zone since the vietnam war . <PARA> insider attacks are on the rise in afghanistan , as tens of thousands of taliban and al - qaeda fighters have infiltrated the afghan national security forces . <PARA> such a rare occurrence as a high - ranking officer ’ s death should have warranted a great deal of attention from our commander - in - chief , but obama has yet to make any public comments regarding his death . not only has obama been unable to make any comment about the general ’ s sacrifice , he also was unable to find the time to make it to general greene ’ s funeral , held in arlington national cemetery . obama himself was conspicuously absent , but so were the vice president and the secretary of defense . the highest ranking and most senior member of obama ’ s administration that found the time to pay respects to the general that was murdered by the enemy was army chief of staff ray odierno . <PARA> this is beyond outrageous , and should be taken as a blatant slap in the face of every military member and civilian that knows and understands the tradition , honor , and respect that comes with military service . in what can only be a gross oversight , or else a belligerent middle - finger , obama hasn ’ t even ordered flags to be flown at half - staff , like he did for the deaths of singer whitney houston , as well as the former communist and south african president nelson mandela . <PARA> there are no words to describe the amount of disrespect that was on display by obama ’ s deliberate absence from the general ’ s funeral . <PARA> summary : in modern warfare it ’ s rather uncommon for very high - ranking u . s . officers to be killed by enemy action . nonetheless , such was the case when a two - star general , u . s . army major general harold greene , the deputy commanding general for the combined security transition command - <PARA> afghanistan , died on 5 august 2014 after an afghan army soldier emerged from hiding in a bathroom at marshal fahim national defense university outside kabul and opened fire on a delegation of u . s . and european military officers , fatally hitting greene ( who was making a routine visit to a training facility ) in the back of <PARA> the head . <PARA> gen . greene was the highest - ranking american servicemember killed by hostile action since lieutenant general timothy j . maude died a result of the terrorist airliner attack on the pentagon on 11 september 2001 , and he was the first u . s . general killed in combat since maj . gen . john a . b . dillard died after his helicopter was shot down in vietnam on 12 may 1970 . <PARA> shortly after greene was interred at arlington national cemetery on 14 august 2014 , political rumors began circulating claiming that not only had president obama broken precedent by failing to attend the funeral himself ( presidents nixon and bush supposedly having attended the funerals of gen . dillard and adm . robinson , respectively ), but that he had declined to send even a token ranking member of his administration to represent the executive branch at the ceremony . such rumors were wrong on both counts . <PARA> although neither president obama nor vice president joe biden attended gen . greene ’ s funeral , a high - ranking obama administration official was present . as the military publication stars and stripes noted in its reporting of the funeral , u . s . secretary of defense chuck hagel attended the ceremony and met with greene ’ s family : <PARA> the somber ceremony for maj . gen . harold j . greene included a riderless horse following the caisson — an honor given to an army or marine corps officer ranked colonel or above — and was attended by more than 100 mourners . <PARA> u . s . army chief of staff gen . ray odierno presented the flag that had covered greene ’ s casket to his widow , susan myers , a retired army colonel . odierno then presented three more flags to greene ’ s son , matthew , a first lieutenant in the army ; his daughter , amelia ; and his father , also named harold . <PARA> the burial was preceded by a chapel service that was closed to media . lt . col . juanita chang , an army public affairs officer , said the 650 - seat chapel at arlington was filled beyond capacity . defense secretary chuck hagel attended and met with the family . <PARA> as for president obama ’ s allegedly breaking precedent by not attending the funeral himself , byron york , one of the journalists who passed along some of the misinformation related to this issue , noted in a mea culpa washington examiner follow - up that : <PARA> curious about what davis had said , i looked for any sign that nixon had attended the dillard funeral . i went to the nixon library website , which has posted the minute - by - minute white house logs of nixon ’ s activities . they ’ re very detailed ; if nixon had gone to the general ’ s funeral , it would have been listed . i looked through the month after dillard ’ s death and found no evidence nixon had attended . likewise , it turned out bush did not attend the maude funeral . <PARA> in regards to the coda of the example reproduced above , which claims that president obama “ hasn ’ t even ordered flags to be flown at half - staff , like he did for the deaths of singer whitney houston , as well as the former communist and south african president nelson mandela ,” president obama did issue a proclamation ordering that u . s . flags on government buildings be flown at half - staff in december 2013 after the death of nelson mandela , the anti - apartheid politician who served as president of south africa in the late 1990s . ( that was a relatively uncommon gesture of respect for a deceased foreign head of state : the last dignitary whose death had been so honored in the u . s . was pope john paul ii in 2005 .) <PARA> however , the claim that president obama ordered u . s . flags on government buildings be flown at half - staff after the death of singer whitney houston in april 2012 is a long - running piece of political misinformation : the president issued a statement of condolence through his press secretary and nothing more ; the gesture of flag - lowering was undertaken only at a state level by governor chris christie of new jersey , houston ’ s home state . <PARA> summary : in march 2015 , actor charlie sheen referenced this item in a rant about president obama ’ s appearance on espn for his annual tradition of filling out his ncaa tournament bracket . <PARA> last updated : 19 march 2015
false	a trait north korean dictator kim jong un shares with u . s . president donald trump is a penchant for hurling sophomoric insults at perceived enemies and rivals , including each other . <PARA> when trump referred to kim as “ rocket man ” in a 2017 speech warning that the united states would “ totally destroy ” north korea if attacked by that country , kim fired back that trump is “ a mentally deranged u . s . dotard .” <PARA> in may 2019 , north korea ’ s state media agency appeared to take inspiration from trump ( who often uses the epithet “ individual of low iq ” to denigrate people he doesn ’ t like ) by calling democratic presidential candidate joe biden “ a fool of low iq ” in response to biden ’ s labeling kim a “ tyrant .” trump , who has himself publicly insulted biden several times since the latter ’ s entry into the 2020 presidential race , tweeted that he “ smiled when [ kim ] called swampman joe biden a low iq individual , & worse . perhaps that ’ s sending me a signal ?” <PARA> trump took it even further in a press conference during a state visit to japan by agreeing with kim ’ s assessment of biden , as reported below by the associated press : <PARA> here is a video clip from that press conference : <PARA> despite criticism from members of both parties for siding with a foreign leader against an american and airing his political grievances on the international stage , trump would double down on his remarks , but not before a random tweet by a u . s . foreign policy expert nudged the controversy into fictional territory . on 26 may , time columnist ian bremmer attributed the following quote to the president : <PARA> though some who read it questioned its authenticity , the attributed quote — “ kim jong un is smarter and would make a better president than sleepy joe biden ” — was initially accepted as real and shared on social media by anti - trump partisans : <PARA> however , in follow - up tweets , bremmer implicitly acknowledged that he had fabricated the quote (“ this is objectively a completely ludicrous quote ,” he wrote ), while simultaneously defending it as “ plausible ” (“ we reasonably suspect trump was thinking it ”) and illustrative of a point he wished to make about “ the state of the media and the twitterverse today .” <PARA> in other words , bremmer was parodying trump ; his intent was satirical . as we have had all too many occasions to point out on this site , however , satire can be a double - edged sword on social media , because some people have trouble recognizing satire as such . bremmer was blasted by critics on all sides for not being clearer about his intent from the beginning . “ it ’ s like he wants to give trump ammo for the ‘ fake news ’ nonsense ,” wrote historian kevin kruse . he called on bremmer to delete the tweet . <PARA> bremmer did remove the tweet , eventually , and issued a clarification and apology : <PARA> whereupon trump , as predicted , pounced on the opportunity to denounce bremmer ’ s original tweet as “ fake news ” and implied that it rose to the level of “ libel ”: <PARA> given bremmer ’ s admission , we rate as false the claim that trump said kim jong un is smarter and would make a better president than joe biden , while noting that the president did , in fact , defend the north korean dictator ’ s alleged characterization of biden as having a low iq . we note further that while bremmer backed down in the face of criticism , trump did not , electing instead to double down on the insult by making light of it in his final tweet on the subject : <PARA> a spokesperson for the biden campaign called trump ’ s comments “ beneath the dignity of the office .”
true	in mid - june 2018 , fanning the uproar over the trump administration ’ s policy of separating families detained at the u . s .- mexico border , a facebook post allegedly written by a commercial flight attendant painted a heartrending picture of “ scared little souls ” being flown to a detention facility in the middle of the night . <PARA> the text was posted by a facebook user who identified herself as a coworker of the author : <PARA> in a subsequent post , the facebook user , anika lodzinski , declined to identify her coworker , whom she said was unwilling to risk his job by going public . nor did she name the airline they both work for ( reposts of the text variously named southwest airlines or american airlines as the carrier , but neither company would confirm or deny those claims ). lodzinski told us via e - mail that she had been directed to refer all media questions to her union ( the association of flight attendants - cwa ). <PARA> “ the incident did happen ,” lodzinski wrote . she said didn ’ t expect her post to garner so much attention . <PARA> afa - cwa e - mailed us a statement saying they had confirmed that the facebook post was real , and written by a flight attendant . though they would not confirm or comment on any details pertaining to the incident beyond that , afa - cwa also provided a statement from international president sara nelson , who said : <PARA> we also requested verification of the incident from u . s . immigration and customs enforcement , but they did not respond to our request in time for publication . <PARA> questions have been raised about the stated boarding and deplaning times ( 12 : 30 a . m . and 2 : 30 a . m ., respectively ), which are two hours apart . typically , a non - stop flight from phoenix to miami takes around four hours , though there is nothing in the original text to indicate that the flight discussed was non - stop , nor that the 12 : 30 a . m . departure was from an arizona airport . <PARA> a reporter for the arizona republic ascertained that an american airlines flight departing from phoenix on the afternoon of 14 june would have arrived in charlotte , north carolina in plenty of time to connect with a late evening ( 10 : 40 p . m .) flight to miami whose departure time on that date was delayed until almost 12 : 30 a . m . it didn ’ t arrive in miami until 1 : 52 a . m ., which lines up reasonably well with the times mentioned in the facebook post . <PARA> after the anonymous post went viral , two more first - person accounts by workers on flights that transported immigrant children emerged that echoed its observations and lent credence to its author ’ s observations . <PARA> on 19 june , the houston chronicle published a lightly edited version of a facebook post by hunt palmquist , who said he has been a flight attendant for a major commercial airline for 29 years . “ several weeks ago ,” he wrote , “ i worked two flights ( one to san antonio and the other to mcallen ) which proved to be two of the most disturbing flights i ’ ve ever experienced in my career .” he continued : <PARA> palmquist vowed he would “ no longer be complicit ” in what he described as a “ disgusting and deplorable cause ,” and pledged to remove himself from any such flights in the future . <PARA> that same day , american airlines flight attendant ian funderburg posted the text of a letter he had addressed to a vice president of the company , in which he wrote : <PARA> funderburg , too , vowed not to participate in such flights in the future . “ i refuse to be complicit in carrying out the abhorrent and abusive anti - immigrant agenda of the trump administration ,” he wrote . <PARA> on 20 june 2018 , american airlines issued a statement both reaffirming their unawareness of cases of the department of homeland security transporting immigrant children separated from their families on their airplanes and asking the federal government to immediately refrain from doing so ( only to be attacked by a dhs spokesperson for “ buckling to a false media narrative ”). frontier , southwest , and united airlines issued similarly worded statements . <PARA> soon afterward , president trump signed an executive order calling a halt to his own administration ’ s family separation policy .

false	on 22 march 2016 a facebook user published the above - reproduced status update , claiming that pantene hair products caused a potentially dangerous reaction on the hair of a client who was getting foil highlights . <PARA> according to the poster , a hair salon client complained that the foils in her hair ( under which bleach had been applied ) felt hot . the colorist maintained that upon examining the situation , he was shocked to discover that the foils were indeed hot to the touch and that when he opened them “ smoke [ came ] billowing out ” of the sealed foil . <PARA> the stylist stated that after he asked all the typical question about product interactions , his client admitted that she used pantene shampoo and conditioner on her hair . oddly enough , the colorist then recalled two separate instances in which clients experienced adverse reactions to unspecified services , both of which shared a culprit : pantene hair products . <PARA> we contacted a colorist with two decades of experience in hair color about this claim , and she reported she had not encountered of such reaction with pantene products during her years of experience doing highlight foils despite pantene products ’ popularity her clients . several other salon representatives with whom we spoke from a number of high - volume new york city salons stated they ’ d never seen nor heard of such a thing occurring either . a large number of clients across the u . s . likely use pantene products daily and and highligh their hair , but social media are not awash in foil fire stories from harried hair salon - goers . <PARA> we also contacted pantene to ask about the claim . a customer care representative with whom we spoke said that pantene ’ s products were safe to use in combination with any typical salon service and reported she was unable to locate any reports of “ smoking ” foils despite the enduring popularity of hair highlighting . the representative stated that all pantene products were thoroughly tested for reactions such ads the one described in the facebook post , and none of that their testing had suggested any likelihood of a such an outcome . the representative did state that had the described incident occurred , it was possible something else used in the salon could have contributed to the reaction . <PARA> the original poster referenced “ plastic and silicones ” as a culprit in the purported incident . pantene lists all their product ingredients on their web site , and nothing in the ingredients list of one of their shampoos ( pantene daily moisture renewal ) was atypical or unusual : <PARA> in fact , the drugstore product had many ingredients in common with the pricier , salon - favorite bumble and bumble seaweed shampoos : <PARA> of particular note is the fact that both products ( one sold in salons , the other in walmart stores ) contain the popular silicon - based polymer dimethicone . the ingredient similarities extend to conditioners , as pantene daily moisture renewal version bears the following list of components : <PARA> compared with bumble and bumble ’ s super rich conditioner , the formulations have many common ingredients : <PARA> of additional interest was the fact that the poster claimed pantene contains “ plastic ( s )” among its ingredients . a chemophobic 2009 salon item fingered one purportedly common “ plastic ” in shampoo as peg - 7m , but that substance is actually a common emulsifier present in the salon ( not drug store ) product referenced above . sold on its own , the product is labeled as an “ all - purpose oil - in - water emulsifier .” <PARA> as it turns out , the “ plastic in pantene ” rumor wasn ’ t a new one in 2016 . a 2008 post on the beauty science blog beauty brains examined then - swirling rumors around panthenol ( a moisturizer and humectant ) and panthenyl ( used for moisturizing properties ). in april 2008 , the cosmetic chemists behind that blog fielded a similar question about plastic in pantene products : <PARA> the blog responded by suggesting that the plastic claim was started by stylists seeking to discourage clients from using less - expensive drugstore products . the blog also urged readers to obtain information about product formulations from additional sources , not just people trying to sell them things : <PARA> ( note that the facebook post quoted at the head of this article concluded by stating “ there is a difference between cheap and salon quality . do not let anyone lie to you and try to say anything more ...” <PARA> the original question fielded by beauty brains in july 2006 involved a reader who asked whether it was true pantene “ coats your hair with plastic or wax to make it seem smooth , soft , and shiny , instead of really moisturizing your hair .” their response explained how that myth got started and why it was easy to debunk : <PARA> in the near - decade between the first appearance of the “ plastic in pantene ” claim and the highlight foil horror story , none of the likely millions of salon customers opting for highlights apparently reported such a reaction attributed to pantene in the online world . ingredients in pantene are not only identical to most other drugstore formulations but are also were highly similar to salon - brand products . the dimethicone used in pantene is also present in many other high - priced hair formulations , none of which stand accused of being “ plastic ” or causing hair fires .
true	origins : natural disasters ( and even sometimes man - made disasters ) are often interpreted by the religiously inclined as signs from god , warnings or punishments visited upon us by the almighty for our moral misbehavior .

false	in june 2016 an image macro became newly popular ( likely due to a concurrent cancer conspiracy rumor ) on social media , holding that the bitter almond tree had been banned across the united states since 1995 because it contains high levels of the cancer - fighting vitamin b17 ( also known as laetrile ): <PARA> the claim was an old and deceptively multi - layered one , asserting that the bitter almond tree had been banned across the united states , that the ban was enacted in a particular year ( 1995 ), that the banned substance contained levels of vitamin b17 sufficient to prevent and treat cancer , and that the unspecified powers that be explicitly and unquestionably banned the plant solely because it could save people ’ s lives by fighting cancer . <PARA> first at issue is whether bitter almond trees have been banned in the u . s . ( by the food and drug administration or any other agency ) since 1995 . we found no evidence corroborating that claim outside its widespread repetition . a 2002 los angeles times item referenced that rumor and concluded by stating that the fda had only prohibited the marketing of bitter almond products for “ unrestricted use ”: <PARA> that article also noted that california ’ s department of health services ( not a federal agency ) regulates the cultivation and sale of bitter almonds within the state , and that both are allowed ( with some caveats ): <PARA> in fact , the rumor that bitter almond trees have been banned ( rather than any actual governmental ban on them ) appears to be more of a hindrance to the growth and availability of them than any real legal prohibition does : <PARA> that interest in bitter almonds is centered in california is unsurprising , as 82 % of all almonds consumed around the world are grown in this state . we contacted the almond board of california for clarification about the ostensibly murky status of bitter almond trees , and that agricultural trade group affirmed that bitter almond trees continue to grow in the state of california ( albeit largely ornamentally rather than commercially ): <PARA> what the fda has targeted is not bitter almond trees themselves , but those who use its derivative products to peddle laetrile to cancer patients , as a 2004 agency press release explained : <PARA> coincidentally , the rumor that the fda had “ banned bitter almond trees ” expressly because “ they contain an [ anti - cancer compound ]” cropped up around the same time that particular crackdown occurred . as as the fda ’ s press release made quite clear , the compound issue of toxicity and false information about cancer treatments and cures were their issues of concern . in the 2004 release , the fda highlighted instances wherein cancer patients had relied on laetrile to a point where their illnesses were no longer treatable , and prosecution of those peddling the substance were aimed at preventing poisoning and ensuring cancer patients weren ’ t duped into purchasing ineffective supplements . the national cancer institute similarly holds that “ laetrile has shown little anticancer effect in laboratory studies , animal studies , or human studies ,” and as far back as 1981 researchers noted that : <PARA> the goverment ’ s enacting a nation - wide ban on an agricultural product simply because its derivatives could be useful in preventing or fighting cancer makes no sense whatsoever outside of alternative medicine conspiracy circles who regularly assert that a power “ cancer industry ” suppresses cancer cures from reaching the public in order to generate more profits for those involved in current forms of cancer diagnosis and treatment . if the u . s . had outlawed bitter almonds solely because of their efficacy in treating cancer , then we would be seeing streams of american cancer patients heading for foreign countries with no such regulation to receive treatment , but we don ’ t . laetrile has long since been exposed as a quack cure , not a legitimate cancer treatment . <PARA> on 1 july 2016 , an fda representative responded to our inquiry and confirmed that agency doesn ’ t have the authority to “ outlaw ” vegetation of any description from growing inside the united states . the scope of their regulatory practice pertains solely to foods , drugs , and the manner in which substances are marketed , with a 2014 voluntary recall of organic raw almonds ( for elevated content of naturally - occurring hydrogen cyanide ) serving as an example of the jurisdiction the fda exercises with respect to food safety . <PARA> it is neither true that the fda has banned bitter almond trees nor suppressed use of the fruit they yield . bitter almond trees are grown agriculturally in california , and although the sale of their seeds is somewhat restricted , that restriction is aimed at both preventing the peddling of an ineffective derivative to cancer patients and to protect consumers from ingesting high levels of toxic hydrocyanic acid .
false	origins : in february 2000 , brayden banks hembree , a young boy just short of his second birthday , lay in a coma at greenville memorial hospital in south carolina , gravely ill from a bout with viral pneumonia . at that time , a family friend sent out the above - quoted plea for prayers to help young brayden through his ordeal . <PARA> according to a ( no longer active ) web site put together by brayden ’ s mother , brayden was admitted to the laurens county hospital in clinton , south carolina , on 19 february 2000 suffering from a high fever which antibiotics had failed to clear up , then transferred to greenville memorial hospital , where he was diagnosed with a severe case of bilateral pneumonia and placed in the pediatric icu . although brayden ’ s condition initially showed signs of improvement , a week into his hospitalization he sustained lung damage and was placed on life support . his prognosis seemed bleak . <PARA> after the passage of another week , however , brayden began to steadily improve . by 16 march 2000 ( coincidentally the date of his second birthday ) doctors were able to remove him from life support , and he was discharged from the hospital in good condition six days later . <PARA> as of the last update posted by his mother in 2003 , brayden was a healthy , happy three - year - old who showed no signs of the brain damage doctors feared he might have suffered . <PARA> to all involved , brayden ’ s recovery was nothing short of miraculous . mission accomplished .
false	on 30 march 2018 , the hoax - spreading , self - described conservative blog fellowshipoftheminds . com posted a story reporting that organizers of the “ march for our lives ” rally in washington , d . c ., had applied for march permits months before the 14 february 2018 school shooting in parkland , florida . <PARA> the story was based on an e - mail exchange between james fetzer , a retired philosopher - turned - conspiracy theorist , and scott earhardt , an officer with the washington , d . c . metropolitan police department ( mpd ). in the message , earhardt appeared to suggest the permit for the 24 march 2018 rally had been submitted well before the 14 february 2018 school massacre at marjory stoneman douglas high school in which seventeen people were murdered , saying that “ in reference to your inquiry concerning the march for our lives demonstration , here in the district of columbia on march 24 , 2018 . mpd received a permit application several months prior to the actual event , and there was several months of planning for this large event .” <PARA> fellowshipoftheminds and other disreputable web sites predictably took this statement at face value and ran with it without verifying whether it was true — and it ’ s not . <PARA> we called earhardt , but he declined to comment because he was not authorized to do so and instead referred us to mpd ’ s public affairs department . however , earhardt told non - partisan fact checker politifact that he had confused the “ march for our lives ” rally with an annual event in january bearing a similar name : march for life . <PARA> mpd spokeswoman karimah bilal told us that the permit application for the march for our lives rally was received on 21 february 2018 , one week after the massacre . we obtained a copy of the march permit application via a freedom of information act request and confirmed that it was submitted on 21 february 2018 , one week after the massacre . the document can be viewed below . <PARA> a pervasive , but consistently unfounded trope among conspiracy theorists and “ hoaxers ” is that any mass casualty incident , particularly mass shootings , are “ false flags ,” or events engineered by the government in a widespread plot to install an authoritarian global government ( often referred to as the “ new world order “). hoaxers generally appear to believe that such tragedies are precursors to a nationwide gun grab , and they have regularly targeted survivors and family members of mass shooting victims from incidents like the 2012 sandy hook elementary school shooting , the 2017 church massacre in sutherland springs , texas and most recently the parkland shooting as a result .

( assuming , of course , that this warning wasn ’ t started by someone in a banana - growing country that competes with costa rica in the u . s . market .) <PARA> necrotizing fasciitis is also known as the “ flesh - eating disease ,” a term that became familiar to many americans after outbreaks of this previously rare affliction occurred in england , canada , and the usa in the 1990s . ( the most prominent victim of necrotizing fasciitis was lucien bouchard , then the leader of canada ’ s bloc quebecois party , whose left leg was amputated after he contracted the disease in 1993 .) necrotizing fasciitis is a bacterial infection caused when some forms of streptococcus bacteria enter a body ( usually through a cut or a scratch ) and spread throughout the skin and subcutaneous tissues , destroying the flesh in the process . <PARA> what little medical information this warning has to offer is specious . the costa rican city of cartago did experience an outbreak of necrotizing fasciitis during the summer of 1999 , but nothing else here rings true . no reports of necrotizing fasciitis ’ ( or any other disease ’ s ) “ decimating ” the monkey population of costa rica have come to light ; the notion of bacteria “ grafting ” themselves to banana skins ( rather than living on , living in , or feeding off banana skins ) is a curious one ; anyone familiar with necrotizing fasciitis would talk about the bacteria that cause the disease ( group a streptococcus ) being present on bananas rather than the disease itself ; and the putative means of transmission of the disease mentioned here ( through ingesting “ infected ” bananas ) is quite different than the usual means . ( not only is contracting necrotizing fasciitis via ingestion improbable , but the warning urges those who have “ eaten ” bananas and come down with symptoms to seek medical attention immediately . why ? the bacteria are supposedly present in the “ skin ” of the banana , a part hardly anyone eats . if necrotizing fasciitis were present on or in the skin , wouldn ’ t anyone who merely handled bananas be at risk ?) <PARA> the caution that one “ is advised not to purchase bananas for the next three weeks as this is the period of time for which bananas that have been shipped to the us with the possibility of carrying this disease ” is also difficult to make sense of . does it mean that the disease has been stopped , but american consumers should avoid buying costa rican bananas for the next three weeks because that ’ s how long it will be before all the pre - stoppage bananas are out of the pipeline ( and grocery stores )? if so , how was the disease stopped ? why should subsequent shipments of bananas from costa rica be considered safe ? ( and when the heck did this three - week period begin , anyway ?) <PARA> of course , there is no “ manheim research institute ” ( any organization bearing that name would likely be spelled “ mannheim ,” and although there is a mannheim university in germany , it does not have a research institute that would be involved in the study of diseases or bacteria ), and the centers for disease control , rather than the fda , would be the proper governmental agency to deal with this type of occurrence . ( later hoaxsters have tried to address this flaw by tacking a “ this has been verified by the center for disease control ” [ sic ] line at the beginning of the message and repeating the name “ center for disease control ” [ sic ] under “ manheim research institute ”). <PARA> because the centers for disease control has been inundated with calls about this scare , it has set up a special banana hotline to ease consumers ’ minds . the number is ( 404 ) 371 - 5375 . <PARA> this piece seems to be a twist on the usual “ beware of shipments from foreign places ” legend type , although the usual agents of death in those tales are venomous creatures ( such as snakes , spiders , and insects ) who become stowaways when the crates of fruit are shipped to the usa and then emerge to attack unsuspecting grocery shoppers . the giveaway that screams “ legend ” here is the tired bugaboo about a government agency ’ s endangering lives by keeping quiet about a potential danger instead of moving to protect the population it ’ s supposed to serve . in this case we don ’ t even get the usual tale about “ powerful banana interests ” using their economic clout to bribe government officials and prevent news of the epidemic from reaching the public and causing banana sales ( and banana profits ) to plummet . nah , this time we ’ re proffered the old “ we don ’ t want to create a panic ” and “ several thousand deaths is an ‘ acceptable number '” excuses . one has to wonder how someone determined that 15 , 000 lives could “ acceptably ” be sacrificed in order to avoid a “ nationwide panic .” do they really expect the public to remain calm if only 12 , 000 people suddenly come down with necrotizing fasciitis ?
false	in early 2019 , a viral facebook message appeared to indicate that the comedian and broadcaster steve harvey had published an unusual defense of president donald trump , likening him to a flawed janitor hired to clear a home of raccoons — which represented the democratic and republican parties as well as undocumented immigrants in the analogy : <PARA> in some cases , the message was simply shared or re - posted without any reference to any author , but in other instances it was attributed to “ steve harvey .” this attribution prompted inquiries from readers about whether the person behind the viral analogy was in fact the well - known and widely - respected host of “ family feud ” and the syndicated talk show “ steve .” at least one blog post explicitly claimed the post had been written by steve harvey , the public figure . <PARA> it ’ s not clear who was the creator of the “ raccoons ” analogy , which has been making the social media rounds since at least 2016 . however , it was shared more than 120 , 000 times after it was posted on 11 january by steve harvey , a facebook user who appears to live in tennessee : <PARA> steve harvey , the popular broadcaster , did not write the message and had not posted it online as of 4 march 2019 . <PARA> harvey met with trump in january 2017 , a week before his inauguration , to discuss a potential collaboration with incoming secretary of housing and urban development ben carson — a meeting which harvey said was initiated by the outgoing obama administration ’ s transition team . ( harvey enjoyed a friendly relationship with obama and interviewed him on his talk show in 2013 .) <PARA> harvey ’ s meeting with trump prompted outrage among some commentators , a backlash which harvey himself criticized as unfair and misleading . however , harvey has since emphasized that he is not “ a trump supporter ” and said he should have accepted his wife marjorie ’ s advice to not meet with the president - elect . <PARA> before the 2018 mid - term elections , harvey expressed strong support for democrat candidates including andrew gillum ( florida gubernatorial candidate ), stacey abrams ( georgia gubernatorial candidate ) and beto o ’ rourke ( texas senate candidate ), saying voters should elect democrats to the u . s . senate and house of representatives , in order to create a greater political “ balance ” within the legislative branch of government .
false	breaking : obama and hillary officially charged with aiding terrorists <PARA> ‘ accessories ’ to terrorism : obama and hillary officially charged <PARA> origins : on 22 february 2015 , several blogs published nearly identical rumors claiming u . s . president barack obama and former secretary of state hillary clinton <PARA> had been “ officially charged ” in egypt with aiding and abetting terrorists , namely muslim brotherhood operatives . most iterations of the story insinuated or outright stated that despite the enormity of such a development , “ mainstream media ” outlets refused to cover it , and there was a deliberate campaign to bury the story . <PARA> the rumor spread rapidly on social media sites , with some users speculating whether obama and clinton would be extradited to egypt to face the purported charges . the claim was also frequently labeled with a “ breaking ” tag , leading many readers to believe that the story was recent to february 2015 . <PARA> one of the most popular iterations was titled “ boom : obama and hillary were officially charged with aiding and abetting terrorists ” and was published on 22 february 2015 : <PARA> the egyptian government has charged president barack obama and former secretary of state hillary clinton with being accessories to terrorism . <PARA> the charges stem from obama and clinton working with the muslim brotherhood , an organization that egypt has declared a terrorist group . <PARA> the complaint against obama names him as “ an accessory to crimes committed by the muslim brotherhood in egypt .” <PARA> the charges stem from obama and clinton working with the muslim brotherhood , an organization that egypt has declared a terrorist group . <PARA> the complaint against obama names him as “ an accessory to crimes committed by the muslim brotherhood in egypt .” <PARA> a second report , based on the first , made similar claims : <PARA> hillary clinton and barack obama are in big trouble this week as they face charges for aiding and abetting terrorism . <PARA> according to conservative tribune , the egyptian government has officially charged the dynamic duo with being accessories to terrorists . the charges stem from hillary and obama working with the muslim brotherhood , an organization that the egyptian government has officially designated a terrorist group . <PARA> the u . s . government has repeatedly refused to call the muslim brotherhood a terrorist group , even though they have repeatedly been linked to hamas . <PARA> meanwhile , hillary has been accused of conspiring against gen . abdel -

fattah el - sissi , the current leader of egypt . <PARA> the rumor appeared to spring from two core misinterpretations . the first was a failure to check the date of the source material : the claims in question stemmed from articles originally published in january 2014 , not january 2015 . the second originated with the source claim , published by wnd on 23 january 2014 . versions reposted by other websites in february 2015 stated : <PARA> according to recent reports , the egyptian government has just charged president obama and hillary clinton with being “ accessories to terrorism .” the charges stem from the partnership the duo formed with the muslim brotherhood , which has been declared a terrorist group by egypt . <PARA> the charges state that obama acted as “ an accessory to crimes committed by the muslim brotherhood in egypt ” claiming that he “ cooperated , incited , and assisted the armed elements of the muslim brotherhood in the commission of crimes .” <PARA> although the united states state department does not list the muslim brotherhood as a terrorist organization , it is well known that they have ties to hamas . <PARA> the charges state that obama acted as “ an accessory to crimes committed by the muslim brotherhood in egypt ” claiming that he “ cooperated , incited , and assisted the armed elements of the muslim brotherhood in the commission of crimes .” <PARA> although the united states state department does not list the muslim brotherhood as a terrorist organization , it is well known that they have ties to hamas . <PARA> however , the original wnd claim was based upon inferences from a single blog : <PARA> two new , classifed documents leaked by egyptian security implicate president obama , secretary of state hillary clinton and former president bill clinton in the aiding and abetting of terrorists . <PARA> the documents have been entered as evidence in the criminal trials of former egyptian president mohammed morsi and other top muslim brotherhood leaders , scheduled to begin next month in cairo . <PARA> the documents have been entered as evidence in the criminal trials of former egyptian president mohammed morsi and other top muslim brotherhood leaders , scheduled to begin next month in cairo . <PARA> wnd ‘ s original claim focused upon the mention of obama and clinton in court papers involving former egyptian president mohammed morsi . it did not suggest clinton or obama had been charged criminally , only that their names had appeared in unspecified court documents . the “ charge ” ( meaning mention of their names ) implied by the blogger in january 2014 eventually grew to a belief the pair had been formally “ charged ” with crimes in egypt . but neither president obama nor hillary clinton has been criminally charged by any egyptian court for aiding and abetting terrorists .

mixture	on 23 september 2016 , facebook users began sharing an article which claimed that the pumpkin typically used in pumpkin pie is in fact a multi - squash blend containing little to no pumpkin : <PARA> although many readers expressed surprise and horror at the concept , the claim was not new . at least two food blogs spilled the beans ( or seeds ) in 2014 , alerting the world to the fact that the pumpkins used in canned pumpkin were of a type largely unsuitable for jack o ’ lantern carving . earlier versions of the claim were less reliant on shock factor and included more detail about the purported makeup of canned pumpkin : <PARA> according to botanists , however , asserting a clear distinction between “ pumpkin ” and “ squash ” is difficult because there is no strict botanical definition for pumpkins . semantically , pumpkins are a type of squash , and the dickinson cultivar is listed as a pumpkin , as are other c . moschata varietals : <PARA> naturally , the thought of a butternut squash ( typically dressed in a savory manner , though not always ) in pie or cheesecake is perceived as less appetizing , and the consternation on social media has been more immediate than it was in 2014 when the matter was approached in a less alarmist fashion . in november 2013 , high plains public radio did a profile — not an exposé — on libby ’ s , dickinson pumpkins , and the aesthetic factor , and they noted that the information they collected no secret : <PARA> although that article compared dickinson cultivars to butternut squash , it included a photograph a field of the former looking like pumpkins — perhaps not doorstep - worthy pumpkins , but recognizable pumpkins nonetheless : <PARA> the label for libby ’ s canned pumpkin also naturally lists “ pumpkin ” and not “ squash ” as an ingredient : <PARA> agricultural trade groups have definitively deemed the c . moschata cultivars as “ pumpkin ” and not “ squash ”: <PARA> a uk - based source for agricultural information noted that the extensive range of varietals under the “ pumpkin ” umbrella are “ also sometimes known ” by either description ( i . e ., pumpkin or squash ): <PARA> some critics have cited lax food and drug administration ( fda ) standards as the culprit behind the purported pumpkin perfidy , but those guidelines ( in effect since 1938 ) don ’ t appear to be predicated on squash subterfuge . nor does the existence of a rule permitting the use of the terms squash and pumpkin interchangeably constitute evidence that the primary brand of canned pumpkin engages in a misleading practice : <PARA> predictably , libby ’ s ( the primary manufacturer of canned pumpkin , and a nestle brand product ) was besieged by legions of concerned holiday bakers on social media shortly after the article referenced above began circulating . many consumers asked if their canned pumpkin was a blend of other squashes , to which a representative for libby ’ s answered : <PARA> nestle maintains that libby ’ s is responsible for the manufacture and sale of 85 percent of pumpkin worldwide ( as high as 90 percent in the u . s .), and their use of a proprietary dickinson cultivar was well - established prior to the great pumpkin panic of 2016 . although pumpkins and squash are very closely related , the company denied that they ever used a “ blend ” of various squashes in their popular canned pumpkin . <PARA> it is true that dickinson pumpkins are less photogenic than common decorative varieties , but it is false that the bulk of canned pumpkin is a blend of winter squashes such as butternut . it is also true that the fda allows for sweet squash blends to be sold under the label of “ pumpkin ,” but that doesn ’ t appear to be the case with libby ’ s , who use dickinson pumpkins . <PARA> in short , pumpkin pie aficionados can rest assured their canned pumpkin of choice is indeed a pumpkin and not a blend of other squashes masquerading as such — although perhaps not a type that could double as a carving pumpkin .
unproven	origins : folklorist jan harold brunvand makes the point that in addition to “ never trust [ ing ] a dead cat story ,” one should also be royally suspicious of pet - nabbing tales . the following comes from a 1993 newspaper : <PARA> eagle snatches dog while owner watches <PARA> valdez , alaska — a bald eagle satisfied its hunger at a valdez gas station when it snatched up a small dog and flew away , leaving the dog ’ s owner screaming in horror . <PARA> the chihuahua - like dog had been let out of a motor home to run around in the station ’ s parking lot while the owners , an unidentified couple from georgia , cleaned the vehicle ’ s windshield . <PARA> witnesses said the pet was about 5 feet away from the rv when the eagle swooped down from a perch in a nearby tree . before the owners could react , the eagle circled up and away , heading off toward the city ’ s harbor clinching the pooch tightly . <PARA> “ it was the damnedest thing i ever saw ,” said dennis fleming , a gas station attendant . “ the dog gave one yelp and that was it .” <PARA> the woman owner clutched her hands to her face and cried , “ oh , my god ,” while fleming tried to console her . <PARA> her husband , however , didn ’ t appear to take the dog ’ s departure too seriously . fleming said as the man walked around the side of the motor home , out of sight of his wife , he began to grin and chopped his hands in the air and exclaimed , “ yeah ! yeah !” <PARA> valdez , alaska — a bald eagle satisfied its hunger at a valdez gas station when it snatched up a small dog and flew away , leaving the dog ’ s owner screaming in horror . <PARA> the chihuahua - like dog had been let out of a motor home to run around in the station ’ s parking lot while the owners , an unidentified couple from georgia , cleaned the vehicle ’ s windshield . <PARA> witnesses said the pet was about 5 feet away from the rv when the eagle swooped down from a perch in a nearby tree . before the owners could react , the eagle circled up and away , heading off toward the city ’ s harbor clinching the pooch tightly . <PARA> “ it was the damnedest thing i ever saw ,” said dennis fleming , a gas station attendant . “ the dog gave one yelp and that was it .” <PARA> the woman owner clutched her hands to her face and cried , “ oh , my god ,” while fleming tried to console her . <PARA> her husband , however , didn ’ t appear to take the dog ’ s departure too seriously . fleming said as the man walked around the side of the motor home , out of sight of his wife , he began to grin and chopped his hands in the air and exclaimed , “ yeah ! yeah !” <PARA> this charming legend ( and newspaper item or not , that ’ s all it is ) relies upon the mental image presented by the <PARA> long - suffering husband ’ s joyfully making “ high five ” motions at the sky just out of sight of his inconsolable wife . where she sees her baby being carried off , he sees liberation from the tyranny of the yapping , four - footed monster that had made his life a living hell . more than one pet owner ’ s spouse can identify with this man ’ s celebration . <PARA> we ’ ve seen the alaskan version of this pounced pooch tale told of dogs of unspecified breeds ( see the above news item ) but also of poodles , pomeranians and chihuahuas . more telling than that , however , is the knowledge that stories very much like this june 1993 “ news story ” appeared in a 1989 collection of urban legends . <PARA> a 1996 british collection of such legends sets the tale in scotland . ( same eagle , guys ?) indeed , summing up all the versions so far encountered , we have : <PARA> beware poached pooch stories , and especially ones wherein the names of the people supposedly victimized are missing . when you boil the alaska version of this tale right down , all you have is the gas station attendant ’ s word that it happened . and gas station attendants like to relate urban legends as much as anybody . <PARA> whether eagles could carry off dogs ( even annoying little ones you ’ d love to kick in the arse if only the wife would turn her back for a second ) as described in the legend is problematic . these large birds of prey generally aren ’ t capable of flight with much more than three or four pounds clutched in their talons ; although they might be able to carry a full - grown dog or cat a short ways , soaring into the heavens with one would most likely be beyond their capabilities . ( click here to learn more about what eagles eat and what they can carry .) <PARA> news stories about predatory owls and hawks make the dog - snatching eagle tale more believable . in 1995 a great horned owl terrorized a maine town . during its reign of mayhem , it took off with a 20 - 25 pound poodle - pekingese mix ( killing it ), went after a cat , and swooped at an old woman . <PARA> in february 2000 , a jack springer sophie was scooped up by an eagle owl in the uk . ( the dog escaped and made it home scratched up but otherwise okay a half hour later .) <PARA> eagle owls are owls , not eagles , and are native to africa and europe . they have no trouble taking off with a hare in their talons , so a small dog is well within their capabilities . <PARA> in december 1999 a florida woman defended her six - pound chihuahua from the 2 . 6 pound red - tailed hawk determined to make off with it . <PARA> could there be a steroid - enhanced eagle out there capable of air - lifting dogs out of their backyards ? it would have to be a very special bird indeed , certainly not your run - of - the - mill eagle . <PARA> in march 2002 , cnn reported on the case of a bald eagle ’ s making off with a 13 - pound dachshund in maine . according to cnn , the dog was lifted three hundred feet into the air before the eagle lost its grip on it . the two - year - old dog survived the encounter , but infections festering in wounds caused by the predator ’ s talons have left it in a fight for its life . <PARA> we don ’ t know how cnn arrived at a figure of 300 feet , because news accounts reported by the local paper the day after the attack stated “ the dog dropped from about the height of a tall tree nearby ,” a height clarified in a later article by that same source as “ perhaps 40 or 50 feet .” a fall of 40 or 50 feet is far more in line with the dog ’ s having lived through the ordeal — 300 feet is equivalent to a 30 - story building , and a dog that fell from that height would not have survived . <PARA> how a bald eagle could manage to take off carrying a 13 - pound animal defies what is known about eagles ; they don ’ t have that kind of lift power . that the fierce predator couldn ’ t successfully carry its load away fits what we know of these birds : they ’ re not built to make off with small dogs even if one of them is ambitious enough to try it . ( the dog ’ s owner credits his pet ’ s escape to the dachshund ’ s having bitten the eagle , but considering that the talon wounds were in the abducted pooch ’ s hindquarters , the dog wouldn ’ t have had a chance to turn on its captor . it fell because the eagle dropped it , not because it attacked its attacker .) <PARA> so where are we with this tale ? we have an eagle that grabbed a small dog and apparently got it up into the air to about the height of a tree before losing it . that the bird tried and succeeded even this much is phenomenal , but it ’ s still nowhere close to being the effortless “ flight into the sunset bearing its prey in its claws ” of legend . <PARA> we ’ re right back to where we started : eagles do not swoop down and carry off small dogs as an ordinary matter of course . some may attack a dog on the ground , and some may even get it temporarily airborne , but they do not ultimately succeed in making off with it . <PARA> barbara “ bawled eagle ” mikkelson
mixture	the use of child labor in cobalt mines in the democratic republic of the congo , where nearly 60 % of the world ’ s cobalt is currently produced , is certainly a major issue that deserves the attention of consumers , corporations , and governments . however , some media outlets and social media users have distorted the issue into a rallying cry against the use of electric cars and clean energy . <PARA> in february 2017 , an investigation by sky news revealed that children as young as 4 years old were working in horrid conditions in cobalt mines in the democratic republic of congo ( drc ): <PARA> while the news outlet reported that cobalt was an “ essential part of most mobile gadgets sold around the world ,” the daily mail seized on another use of cobalt , the manufacturing of electric car batteries , when it repackaged the sky news report in an august 2017 article entitled : “ child miners aged four living a hell on earth so you can drive an electric car : awful human cost in squalid congo cobalt mine that michael gove didn ’ t consider in his ‘ clean ’ energy crusade .” <PARA> the headline of the daily mail article may have left some readers with the impression that cobalt is used solely in the manufacturing of electric car batteries . this chemical , however , is also used to manufacture rechargeable batteries in cellphones , laptops , tablets , and other electronics . the cobalt institute reports that about 42 % of all cobalt produced globally can be found in these rechargeable batteries . a quarter of that , according to a february 2018 article on phys . org , is used for electric car batteries . in other words , only about 10 % of all cobalt produced globally is used in electric car batteries . <PARA> the remaining 58 % of the cobalt produced globally is used in industrial and military applications ( super alloys , catalysts , magnets , and pigments , among others ). <PARA> the daily mail article also stated that “ almost every big motor manufacturer striving to produce millions of electric vehicles buys its cobalt from the impoverished central african state ,” but that is also misleading , because many electric car manufacturers have committed to procuring their cobalt from ethical sources . bmw , for instance , recently stated that it will purchase all of its cobalt from australia and morocco to ensure that child labor isn ’ t used in the mining of this material . <PARA> bmw also insists on transparency in every step of the supply chain in order to ensure that the cobalt it procures comes from an ethical source : <PARA> tesla has also been working to both reduce the amount of cobalt needed to manufacture its batteries and to procure cobalt from more ethical sources . since 2012 , tesla has reduced the amount of cobalt in its batteries from 60 % to just 3 %. company founder elon musk has also stated that he is hoping to eliminate cobalt altogether in the company ’ s next generation of batteries . tesla has also committed to sourcing its cobalt from more ethical sources in north america . <PARA> some industry experts , however , have expressed doubts that tesla will be able to achieve these goals . caspar rawles , an analyst at benchmark mineral intelligence who focuses on the cobalt market , told the verge in june 2018 : <PARA> in sum , it ’ s true that the majority of the world ’ s cobalt supply comes from the democratic republic of congo , where numerous reports of child - labor and human - rights abuses have been uncovered . it ’ s also true that cobalt is a chemical element that is used in electric car batteries . however , it ’ s misleading to claim that these children are “ living a hell on earth so you can drive an electric car ,” because the majority of cobalt is not used for electric car batteries , and electric car manufacturers , such as tesla and bmw , procure their cobalt from sources outside of the drc .
true	examples : [ collected via e - mail , august 2012 ] <PARA> in his 13 years in congress , paul ryan got only two bills passed . one was to change the name of the post office in his home town . <PARA> origins : in august 2012 republican presidential candidate mitt romney tapped as his vice presidential running mate congressman paul ryan , who has represented wisconsin ’ s 1st district in congress since 1999 . that selection focused attention on the legislative record of ryan , including the number of bills he sponsored that had been passed into law . <PARA> according to the library of congress ’ thomas legislative <PARA> information source , rep . ryan in his congressional career has been the primary sponsor of two bills that have been passed and enacted as law : a 2000 bill to name a united states postal service facility in his hometown of janesville , wisconsin , and a 2004 bill to modify the excise taxes on arrows used as archery equipment . ( in the former case , the bill did not name a usps building after ryan himself , as mentioned in one of the examples reproduced above , but after les aspin , a democratic congressman who for twenty - two years represented the same wisconsin district that ryan currently does .) during his tenure in congress rep . ryan has also sponsored 73 bills that were not passed and signed on as co - sponsor of another 975 bills . <PARA> in general , several thousand bills are introduced in every congress , but only about 5 % of them — roughly an average of one per congressmember per term — are eventually passed into law .
false	the “ giant sea spider ” shown in the above photographs is not a recent discovery by scientists , as these same images have been circulating on the internet at least as far back as mid - 2013 . the interdigital webbing ( which is found in mammals , not in arthropods with exoskeletons ) and the unbelievably long and bony tail exhibited in these images mark this creature as an unrealistic fake , likely based on a prop of the “ queen facehugger ” organism from the alien series of movies : <PARA> there are real species of animals known as sea spiders , and some of them do inhabit the waters of the arctic and antarctic , but they look nothing like the example shown above in size or appearance . an unknown species of sea spider was discovered near antarctica in march 2008 , but it barely resembled the example shown here : it was very different in color ( bright red rather than black ), had no interdigital webbing , had no tail , and ( even though it was described as “ gargantuan ” for this type of sea creature ) was less than ten inches long :
unproven	more than a week after it was published , a 3 october 2017 facebook post purporting to depict the aftermath of an expectant father ’ s brain hemorrhage and surgery went viral . the post , which was subsequently deleted from the facebook page of photography company endres photography , described the testimony of a client named brianna , who asserted that this life - altering event was caused by her husband ’ s excess consumption of energy drinks : <PARA> fox news was among the sites that picked up brianna ’ s click - friendly story , but no one reporting on the topic appeared to look further than her facebook post to verify whether the details were accurate or correct . dates , locations , and other information necessary to verify her husband austin ’ s purported diagnosis were missing from news accounts ; instead , those reports incorporated quotes and screenshots from a single secondhand facebook post . articles on the subject did not even include statements from doctors verifying that the information presented was credible or medically plausible . <PARA> we reached out to three medical experts to assess the plausibility of the scenario described by endres photography but had not received a response by press time . a search of medical literature suggests that a hemorrhage caused by an energy drink is plausible but unlikely , and , if a connection between the two were present at all , it would be poorly understood . <PARA> the primary link , if there is one , would likely come from caffeine ’ s effect on blood pressure . caffeine , by constricting blood vessels , increases a person ’ s blood pressure , which can ultimately increase the risk of hemorrhaging in the brain . a number of analyses have reached conflicting conclusions about the reality of this scenario , however . <PARA> a 2016 paper purports to present the first case report in medical literature suggesting a connection between energy drinks and brain hemorrhaging . that single report , concerning a 57 - year - old who consumed an energy drink called redline , does not provide much outside of speculation , however : <PARA> based on brianna ’ s account , the doctors in her case “ concluded ” the cause of her husband ’ s brain hemorrhage was his ( admittedly considerable ) energy drink habit , based only on the fact that no other drugs were found in his system . without knowing what additional information was available to the doctors , it is impossible to say whether or not this conclusion was , similarly , speculative on their part . <PARA> regardless of the specific cause of brain hemorrhaging , removing a portion of the victim ’ s skull ( a procedure known as a decompressive hemicraniectomy ) is sometimes indicated as a treatment for some kinds of such hemorrhages . it is therefore possible that such a surgery , the aftermath of which might be depicted in these photographs , would be performed on someone with excessive bleeding in the brain . <PARA> however , in the lack of additional information we cannot know if doctors did indeed diagnose a man named austin with a brain hemorrhage , if they attributed the hemorrhage to an energy drink , and if they were correct in doing so . if events did indeed occur this way , they would be — based on the scientific literature — extremely rare .

true	examples : <PARA> origins : a common ( and unfortunately , effective ) technique for luring e - mail users into opening virus - launching attachments is to send messages that would appear to be relevant or important to many of their potential recipients . one way of accomplishing this feat is to make the virus - carrying messages appear to come from some type of business entity that many people commonly deal with , such as one of the large internet auction or retailing sites , or a national bank ( or other financial institution ), or a major provider of a common service . <PARA> that last area usually comes into play around the winter holiday season , when e - mail users experience the onset of a viruses spread through messages purporting to come from parcel delivery companies such as the united parcel service ( ups ) or federal express ( fedex ). the bogus messages typically inform users about packages they have supposedly sent that could not be delivered due to incorrect recipient addresses and invite them to open and print out attached invoices in order to claim the undelivered packages . the messages include file attachments with names like ‘ ups_invoice . zip ’ that actually harbor malicious executable files (‘ ups_invoice . exe ’ or the like ) and display as a microsoft word icon to make it appear like a harmless word document and thereby lure recipients into clicking on it . <PARA> a mass mailing of this type is bound to hit quite a few people who have shipped parcels in the recent past ( especially around the holidays ) and therefore might easily be lured into opening the virus - launching attachment , so ups was quick to put up ( and e - mail ) a warning about the malicious messages : <PARA> ups currently has the following warning on their web site about the phony e - mails : <PARA> fedex placed a similar warning on their site : <PARA> a version aimed at dhl surfaced in late march 2009 , prompting that company to post an alert on their web site : <PARA> yet another version ( cited in the ‘ examples ’ section above ) featuring messages purportedly originating with the united states postal service ( usps ) began circulating in september 2010 , with those messages asking recipients to print out a mailing label in order to lure them into opening the enclosed attachment ( uspslabel . zip ) and activating the malware contained therein . the usps posted a warning about this version on its web site : <PARA> as of march 2011 , canada post was also warning of similar virus mailings :

unproven	a young couple from arizona , who apparently decided to pull up stakes and move to chicago , sparked derision after claiming in a viral youtube video that they left just one day after their arrival after being assaulted by a “ sketchy ” man near a transit station . <PARA> the couple , jaelin and brianna white , claim their occupations are house flipper and maker of youtube videos , respectively . <PARA> according to the chicagoist , their video (“ our chicago story ”) was posted to reddit , where it quickly went viral . as of 6 september 2016 , it has been viewed nearly 1 . 6 million times . it has received so much negative attention that a local comedian , kevin fergus , has scheduled a satirical “ brianna and jaelin walking tour ” for 6 september 2016 , visiting the “ landmarks ” mentioned by the couple . <PARA> many of the key claims made in the video , however , are vague and difficult to verify . they posted the video on 2 august 2016 , and said they made their move “ two weeks ago .” they did not give an exact date for the alleged assault that caused them to change their minds about their new city . and not everyone believes their story . <PARA> jaelin white , who has not yet responded to our attempts to speak to him , says in the video that he and brianna moved to chicago and chose a short - term rental in a good neighborhood north of the loop , a business district . <PARA> things supposedly went sour quickly when they chose to take the chicago red line to a chipotle restaurant near loyola university . they claim that a stranger started talking to them as they waited on the granville station platform , asking them where they live and what they do . they say the man made them so uneasy that they skipped the rail , even though they had already bought tickets , and made their way on foot to a nearby subway restaurant , where they sought shelter . they claim the man followed them there and they believed he was going to shoot or rob them . “ i was just worried he had a gun or something ,” white said . <PARA> nevertheless , he says he went outside to ask the man what he was doing , if he wanted a sandwich or whether he needed help getting home . they then claim they “ ordered an uber ” and called 911 . despite claiming to believe the man had a gun and might pose a physical danger , the couple continued talking with him . in a strange twist , white says that they jumped into what they thought was their driver ’ s car , even though their uber was still five minutes away — but not before their assailant , unprovoked , punched him in the face as hard as he could . they then claim the man tried to pry open the door of the car they had hopped into , but the driver accelerated away to safety . <PARA> they then said the driver , whose private vehicle they had apparently commandeered , took them to a cvs parking lot where they saw their alleged attacker celebrating the punch “ like a caveman ”. despite experiencing what they claim to be a “ traumatic ” experience and being extremely frightened , they make no mention of filing a police report , even though they claim to have called the police to the cvs parking lot . white says the police called him from the parking lot , but the couple was too busy collecting their valuables and cancelling credit cards to speak to them . <PARA> chicago police told us they did receive a call for service on 23 july 2016 from an arizona phone number . police responded , but when they arrived , no one was there to meet them and they found no suspect . they confirmed that neither jaelin or brianna white filed a police report . <PARA> peter bella , writing for chicago now , doesn ’ t believe events occurred the way the couple claims they did . bella notes that while the couple is nebulous about details , like the date and time of the reported assault , they manage to mention numerous brand names . he said that he suspects the video is nothing more than viral marketing : <PARA> no one with the name jaelin white has a real estate license in the state of arizona , but jaelin claims to be an investor . brianna white posts videos about things like make - up , consumer items and her daily routine to her youtube channel , where she has more than 318 , 000 subscribers . <PARA> without a police report or corroborating statements from witnesses , it ’ s impossible to verify that jaelin white was indeed physically assaulted in chicago . without documentation of leasing or rental agreements , it ’ s also impossible to say whether they truly intended to move to chicago . they make no mention of the names or addresses of their prospective residences in that city . <PARA> you can view their video describing the alleged incident here , and below you can see the spoof video publicizing the “ brianna and jaelin white walking tour ”:
true	dear reverend sharpton : <PARA> i have read about you with much interest since learning of the protest you plan to lead against me in maricopa county in june as a way to force my resignation or removal from office . <PARA> your public proclamation leads me to the conclusion : not only do you not understand arizona ; you also do not understand democracy . as the elected sheriff who , so far has been elected to five consecutive four - year terms , i answer to the four million residents of maricopa county . i do not answer to the whims of the media , or locally and nationally elected officials who want open borders and who have their own agendas . nor do i answer to a publicity hound outside interloper who has demonstrated no interest in looking for the truth before making loud uninformed noises . <PARA> while your public outcries are colorful , there are several instances where you have inserted yourself into other people ’ s affairs without knowing any of the facts . poor judgment has caused you plenty of trouble in the past and promises to do so again . most earnest people want to learn by their mistakes . you seem to glory in repeating them . <PARA> i would like to help you avoid further embarrassment by assisting in your understanding of the illegal immigration problem here in my county . when and if you do make the trip here , i invite you to call me to talk about these false allegations . <PARA> we can discuss how my deputies are extensively trained by the federal government to properly combat illegal immigration and how the laws of this <PARA> state allow this sheriff ’ s office to question and investigate the immigration status of those people deputies detain in the course of our everyday law enforcement duties . <PARA> don ’ t make the same mistake made by the four democratic congressmen calling for a u . s . department of justice investigation of this office . they and other politicians relied solely on media reports and anti -

false	origins : although the japanese film was substantially altered in its american release , the climactic battle between the two titans ended with the same results in both versions : an ambiguous draw . <PARA> just as additional footage featuring an <PARA> american actor ( raymond burr ) was integrated into the original godzilla film to enhance its appeal to american audiences , so it was with king kong vs . godzilla : additional scenes shot by an american director ( featuring michael keith as “ eric carter , your u . n . reporter ”) were added to the american version . the latter film was substantially altered in many other ways as well , however . much footage was cut from the japanese release to make room for scenes featuring eric carter and his u . n . news reports , most of the original score was replaced with music from the soundtrack of the creature from the black lagoon , the dialogue was changed in the dubbing process , and special effects were altered or replaced . <PARA> one element that did remain the same in both versions was the action between king kong and godzilla . the last sequence of the movie features the giant dinosaur and enormous gorilla battling it out atop mt . fuji , in a showdown the desperate japanese population hopes will result in the destruction of both . the two monsters eventually carry their fight to the ocean and both are soon submerged beneath the waves . in the film ’ s final scene , only king kong arises from the water , swimming back to his home on the island from which he had been captured . although this ending gives the impression that kong vanquished his reptile foe , we all know that godzilla can survive underwater , and as the next installment in the godzilla series ( godzilla vs . the thing ) opens with godzilla emerging from the ocean , we can only assume the mutant dinosaur tricked kong by playing possum under the sea . <PARA> ( there is a slight difference between the two versions that implies king kong may have been the winner , though : in the american release , we hear the sound of kong roaring as he swims away at the end of the film . in the japanese version , however , there are two roars — godzilla first , then kong . the omission of godzilla ’ s roar at the end of the us version certainly could create the impression in viewers that only king kong had survived .) <PARA> in any case , the movie ’ s visual ending was exactly the same in both the japanese and american releases . probably because americans found it unlikely that a japanese - produced horror film would show a quintessentially american monster triumphing over a japanese invention , a rumor began shortly after the movie ’ s 1964 american release that two different endings had been filmed : one for japanese audiences ( in which only godzilla survived ), and one for american audiences ( with king kong the winner ). no doubt whispers that there were indeed two different versions of the film helped foster the legend that there were two different endings as well , although it is unlikely that many people actually saw both versions . <PARA> sightings : the genus iii edition of trivial pursuit asks “ who won the japanese version of king kong vs . godzilla ?” and claims “ godzilla ” as the correct answer .
unproven	my 7 year old daughter has been getting bullied on the bus ( go ahead bus company ) as well as on the school grounds at st . louis charter school ( slcs ). i am so sickened that nothing has been done about any of the bullying on their end , and i ’ m simply fed up . my child , dakota lamb , came home from school today and i noticed that the entire back of her hair had been drastically chopped with the shortest layer being about an inch from her scalp at the top of her head . i am so livid that my child was assaulted by a deadly weapon when the 4th - 8th grade students ( yes , that ’ s plural ) took scissors to her head on a moving bus while picking on her . please help us put an end to the violence and bullying in this school . i want everyone to know the wrongs that are not being righted in this school and on the buses of this bus company !! <PARA> origins : in january 2013 brianna lamb , the mother of 7 - year - old dakota lamb , reported to police that her daughter had been hit in the stomach and her hair forcibly cut while she was riding on a school bus , events which she maintains are just the latest in a string of bullying incidents targeting her daughter : <PARA> the mother of a 7 - year - old girl has had enough of the bullying on her daughter ’ s school bus . following a recent incident , brianna lamb has decided to go to the police . <PARA> lamb said the bullying happened while her daughter dakota was <PARA> on a bus from st . louis charter school . <PARA> the fact that the bus was moving made the situation not only wrong , but dangerous , she said . unfortunately for dakota , the hair cut wasn ’ t all she endured . <PARA> “ i asked her what happened and some of the other older students on the bus had taken scissors to the back of her hair after hitting her in the stomach a couple times ,” lamb said . <PARA> the mother immediately called police and filed a report . <PARA> lamb said this is only the latest in a series of incidents with older students harassing her daughter . <PARA> “ she ’ s trying to take it day by day but she ’ s emotional and distraught ,” lamb said . “ she was seven years old and her hair was her life , and she ’ s really upset these kids were hateful to her .” <PARA> lamb said the bullying happened while her daughter dakota was <PARA> on a bus from st . louis charter school . <PARA> the fact that the bus was moving made the situation not only wrong , but dangerous , she said . unfortunately for dakota , the hair cut wasn ’ t all she endured . <PARA> “ i asked her what happened and some of the other older students on the bus had taken scissors to the back of her hair after hitting her in the stomach a couple times ,” lamb said . <PARA> the mother immediately called police and filed a report . <PARA> lamb said this is only the latest in a series of incidents with older students harassing her daughter . <PARA> “ she ’ s trying to take it day by day but she ’ s emotional and distraught ,” lamb said . “ she was seven years old and her hair was her life , and she ’ s really upset these kids were hateful to her .” <PARA> exactly what took place remains to be determined , as the bus company involved said there were no cameras on the vehicle to record in the incident , and police are “ still sorting out the details ”:
false	every fast food chain gets its own urban legend these days , from claims of worms in mcdonald ’ s hamburgers to roaches in taco bell tacos to snakes in burger king ’ s ball pits , we ’ re determined to demonize corporate purveyors of cheap , industrial food products . it appears to be kfc ’ s turn in the spotlight again ( their original legend about the fried rat having become a bit long in the tooth ), and they have become the proud owners of a legend intended to reflect another modern fear : genetically engineered food : <PARA> versions of this legend have been circulating for decades now , as indicated by the e - mail ’ s reference to kentucky fried chicken ’ s “ recent ” name change , an event that took place in 1991 . earlier versions of the tale featured six - legged chickens (“ how do they taste ?” “ dunno ; no one ’ s ever been able to catch one ”) or birds so plumped by chemicals that their gigantic breasts made it impossible for them to keep their balance well enough to walk . <PARA> it ’ s easy to see why this legend has suddenly made such a strong resurgence . our continual progress in understanding and manipulating the genetic codes of plants and animals has fueled debate over the environmental and health concerns raised by the creation and growth of transgenic food crops and the marketing of food products derived from animals that have been given artificial hormones . additionally , to those who already feel that our killing and eating other animals is morally wrong , this legend highlights the complete disregard most humans hold for the rights of animals and the increasingly inhumane conditions under which food animals are raised . “ the government that ’ s supposed to be looking out for our health and safety doesn ’ t really care about us ” theme also makes an appearance here : a private company has supposedly created a genetically altered form of an animal that is raised and eaten by the hundreds of millions every year , and all the government has done about the situation is to require them to stop using the word ‘ chicken ’ to describe this product ? <PARA> nothing like the frankensteinian laboratory scenario described here is taking place , however . raising chickens that have been genetically modified so that they are born without beaks , feathers , or feet , or with additional legs is still beyond the reach of modern science for the time being ( although selective breeding has been used to enhance some features , such as breast size ), nor did the university of new hampshire perform a “ study of kfc .” as well , the claims about kentucky fried chicken ’ s name change are easily belied : <PARA> kentucky fried chicken decided to change its name to kfc in 1991 for several reasons , none of which had anything to do with governmental regulations about mutant animals : <PARA> nonetheless , the “ great kfc mutant chicken myth ” grew so prominent online that kfc eventually addressed it on their web site : <PARA> how concerned we should be about genetically engineered food products is one thing , but no amount of concern or protest is going to “ make kfc start using real chicken again ”: “ real chicken ” is what kfc has been using all along . <PARA> sightings : a scientist breeds headless , boneless chickens on a high - tech farm in the 1967 italian film death laid an egg ( la morte ha fatto l ’ uovo ).
false	on 28 october 2016 , fbi director jim comey declared that the agency may have discovered additional e - mails connected to hillary clinton ’ s use of a private server during her tenure as secretary of state . since then , several rumors have circulated holding that high - ranking democratic officials have “ jumped ship ” and abandoned their party ’ s presidential nominee , such as a ( false ) claim that president obama had canceled all of his upcoming campaign appearances and a ( false ) claim that michelle obama had “ scrubbed ” her twitter account of all mentions of clinton . <PARA> although we ’ ve already looked into the aforementioned claims and found them all to be false , some donald trump supporters have nonetheless doubled down and asserted that president obama and elizabeth warren have both also unfollowed clinton on twitter : <PARA> the above - displayed image is not “ proof ” that president obama unfollowed hillary clinton . in order to properly # factcheck this claim , one would have to prove that president obama ’ s twitter account had followed clinton ’ s in the first place , something that those making this claim failed to do . although this image most likely taken with a service such as doesfollow . com ) may be real , it only documents that president obama doesn ’ t currently follow hillary clinton on twitter , not that he previously did and has since “ unfollowed ” her . <PARA> similar claims were made concerning other top democratic officials , such as masschusetts senator elizabeth warren : <PARA> again , this image only shows that warren doesn ’ t follow hillary clinton on twitter , not that she “ unfollowed ” clinton after the fbi ’ s announcement . <PARA> sean hannity amplified these baseless claims during his show on 1 november 2016 , then shortly afterwards took to twitter to apologize and offer a correction : <PARA> it should also be noted that while senator warren and president obama do not follow hillary clinton on twitter , they have both used that medium to express their support for the democratic presidential candidate :
true	for years now , there has existed a thriving trade in so - called “ black americana ,” a catchall term for historical memorabilia related to america ’ s racist past . <PARA> the items valued by collectors range from real artifacts of slavery to relics of the “ jim crow ” era of segregation in the south to examples of offensive racial stereotyping in popular culture ( many of which date from not very long ago ). <PARA> some of these items , by their very nature , trigger controversy . others become tainted with controversy when divorced from their original contexts or inserted into new ones , inviting misinterpretation or misunderstanding . an example of the latter is a subset of commercial signage from the jim crow period enforcing the segregation of blacks and whites . few people nowadays are surprised to learn that “ whites only ” signs were posted on entrances to public buildings and facilities , but the fact that “ blacks only ” or “ coloreds only ” signs existed seems to flummox a lot of people . <PARA> one example posted to the snopes . com facebook group for verification on 10 may 2017 prompted an intense debate , partly because it was introduced in a new , ahistorical context : <PARA> having searched in vain for evidence to back it up , we ’ re skeptical of the claim that signs like this are currently “ appearing on college campuses ” in the united states , though we have seen such images used to illustrate internet posts ( such as here and here ) decrying alleged instances of “ reverse discrimination ”. <PARA> it is real , but hardly an example of racism against white people . the sign depicted above dates from 1921 , and it originally adorned the lenox theatre in the once - thriving “ golden blocks ” business district of augusta , georgia , which was home to dozens of black - owned businesses , including restaurants , banks , theaters , a meat market , and a real estate agency . <PARA> the lenox was , in fact , a “ colored only ” movie theater — a place where african american patrons weren ’ t relegated to sitting in the back rows , as was typically the case in theaters across the segregated south ( if african americans were allowed to enter such places at all ), according to a retrospective in the augusta chronicle : <PARA> more typically , “ colored only ” signs designated building entrances or public facilities ( such as restrooms , swimming pools and drinking fountains ) that african americans were allowed to use ( when they existed at all ), in lieu of those marked “ white only .” despite its “ separate but equal ” credo , jim crow perpetuated inequality by granting preferential treatment to whites , author jerrold m . parks wrote in american nightmare : the history of jim crow : <PARA> that a vintage “ no whites allowed ” sign from that era should engender a raging debate about “ reverse racism ” in 2017 betrays an woeful ignorance of american history . it wasn ’ t an instance of discrimination when black - owned businesses such as the lenox theatre enacted “ colored only ” policies in the segregated south ; on the contrary , it was one of the few means at hand to redress it .

false	august 2016 saw the circulation of rumors holding that the ford motor company had donated a large sum of money ( typically between one and 100 million dollars ) directly to the black lives matter movement : <PARA> a ( since removed ) blog post published by allen b . west ’ s blog on 11 august 2016 called for a boycott of the automaker over the issue : <PARA> the origins of the rumor lay with a 19 july 2016 announcement from the ford foundation titled “ why black lives matter to philanthropy ” explaining why that foundation had “ made six - year investments in the organizations and networks that compose the movement for black lives ”: <PARA> however , the flaw in claiming that the ford motor company donated millions of dollars to the black lives matter movement is two - fold . first , although the philanthropic ford foundation is so named because it was created and originally funded by automobile icon henry ford ( along with his son edsel ) and because the foundation was a large holder of ford stock , those associations ended many years ago . no member of the ford family or ford motor company management sits on the ford foundation board of trustees , and the ford foundation began selling off its ford motor company stock in the mid - 1950 ’ s ( a process that was completed in 1974 ). the completely separate ford motor company fund and community services is the current philanthropic arm of the ford motor company . <PARA> second , although they may have common goals , the black lives matter movement and the movement for black lives are not the same thing . the latter is not a single group or movement , but rather “ a coalition of over 50 black - led organizations ”: <PARA> some of the blog posts responsible for the spread of the rumor that the ford motor company had given millions of dollars to black lives matter were later edited to note that the ford foundation and ford motor company had long since parted ways , but by then the claim had already been loosed into the wilds of social media , and the important distinction between the two entities was lost as the rumor traveled from blog to blog .
false	the trump administration ’ s “ zero tolerance ” immigration policy became the leading political issue of the summer of 2018 , with images and accounts of children being separated from their detained immigrant parents causing widespread outrage and fierce debate . <PARA> in light of this outrage , some commentators — many but by no means all supporters of u . s . president donald trump — sought to highlight the immigration policies of former president barack obama and leveled allegations of hypocrisy against trump ’ s liberal opponents , reminding them that some critics of obama referred to him as the “ deporter - in - chief ” during his administration due to the record number of deportations that took place during his two terms — which was due in part , but not entirely , to a change in the definition of the word . <PARA> on 23 june 2018 , the right - wing “ federalist papers ” facebook page published a widely - shared meme which claimed that obama had overseen the separation of 89 , 000 children from their parents at the united states border with mexico , alleging a “ double standard ” and “ media bias ” against trump . <PARA> the two figures included in the meme do not describe the same thing , and the meme is fundamentally compromised by a gross misrepresentation of the differing immigration policies of the obama and trump administrations . <PARA> the administration of president trump and attorney general jeff sessions introduced a new “ zero tolerance ” immigration policy in april 2018 . whereas previously , those found crossing the border into united states illegally were largely subjected to administrative proceedings , before being deported , the zero tolerance policy instructed border agencies and immigration courts to arrest immigrants for violating u . s . immigration laws , and subject them to criminal trial , prosecution and incarceration , before their eventual deportation . <PARA> one necessary and foreseen consequence of this new policy was that adults who crossed the border from mexico into the u . s . along with their children would have their children taken away from them while they were detained , pending criminal trial , and during their period of incarceration . <PARA> in a speech about the zero tolerance policy , in may 2018 , sessions made it clear that the separation of children from their parents was a foreseen and intended component of the policy . <PARA> as a result of the new policy , 2 , 342 children were separated from their parents between 5 may and 9 june 2018 , according to multiple news reports which cited official figures provided by a department of homeland security spokesperson on 19 june 2018 . <PARA> since the policy began with a 6 april memo distributed by sessions , and persisted after 9 june 2018 , the real number of children separated from their parents at the border is likely to be significantly higher . the figure of 1 , 900 presented in the federalist papers meme was well out of date by the time it was published on 23 june 2018 . <PARA> the federalist papers facebook page did not cite any sources for either of the numbers included in its meme . however , the figure of 89 , 000 is likely to have come from a january 2016 investigation by the associated press . <PARA> that investigation did not refer to the number of children separated from their parents upon crossing the mexican border into the united states . instead , the associated press tracked the fate of children who entered the united states on their own , a cohort known as “ unaccompanied alien children ” ( uacs .) therefore , any comparison between the figure of 89 , 000 and the figure of 1 , 900 is utterly spurious and grossly misleading : <PARA> in other words , the figure of 89 , 000 refers specifically to the number of children who arrived in the united states alone between october 2013 and january 2016 and were placed with sponsors throughout the country . it does not refer to children whom united states border agencies separated from their families , which is the case with trump ’ s “ zero tolerance ” policy . <PARA> official figures are not available for the number of children taken from families while their parents underwent criminal prosecution after being detained at the border during obama ’ s tenure as president . we asked the department of homeland security for those numbers and received no response . <PARA> that means it is not possible to make a precise statistical comparison between obama and trump on this specific outcome . however , immigration experts and former homeland security officials agree that the rate of child separation under obama is likely nowhere close to what has been seen under trump . <PARA> criminal prosecution for improperly crossing into the united states was the exception under the obama administration , whose policy largely limited that approach to known criminals and repeat offenders . under the “ zero tolerance ” policy implemented by trump and sessions , criminal prosecution for any unauthorized border crossing is the rule rather than the exception .
false	here are some of the most common versions of a long - running internet hoax that has been circulating online in one form or another since 1997 . the names of the companies involved and the supposed rewards to be had periodically change , but the basic come - on remains the same : fool gullible netizens into endlessly forwarding junk messages to their friends and acquaintances with phony promises of cash and free merchandise : <PARA> nothing about this form of hoax is real : bill gates isn ’ t giving $ 5 , 000 to facebook users who click a share link , the plan wasn ’ t written up in usa today ( other than in articles about internet hoaxes ), microsoft isn ’ t running a tracked “ e - mail beta test ” with bill gates paying people for participating , and intel and aol aren ’ t merging . microsoft put up a message on their web site warning the public about this hoax back in 1999 : <PARA> the photograph shown above is an altered version of a picture of bill gates taken prior to a february 2013 ama ( ask me anything ) session on reddit . <PARA> the bottom line is that no matter which incarnation of this silliness one receives , the principle is the same : there ’ s still no free lunch , and big companies aren ’ t going to hand out fabulous vacations , thousands of dollars , free trendy clothes , new computers , cases of candies , wads of cash , or new cars just because someone with a functioning internet connection does them the favor of forwarding an e - mail . though at first blush , participating in such pie - in - the - sky wishfulness appears perfectly harmless , such participation only serves to clog up already overtaxed resources . oh yes , it does one other thing : it gives the pranksters who cooked up these frauds a great big laugh at others ’ expense .

false	variations : in circulation in e - mail in october 2010 was this version : <PARA> origins : oh , if only it were that simple ! the above incitement to female nudity is offered in a tongue - in - cheek fashion , yet we have folks ask us if it was on the up - and - up , hence this article . <PARA> no , the president of the united states of america has not made such a request . it ’ s incongruous to believe that a man whose term began with the suggestion that he was instituting a dress code at the white house would now be advocating public nudity as a response to terrorism . ( the dress code brouhaha was put to rest in a statement made by ari fleischer , white house press secretary , during a 15 february 2001 press briefing .) <PARA> whether or not muslims are offended by female nudity is a moot point — clearly the terrorists aren ’ t . an examination of the activities of the hijackers in the days and months leading to the september 11 attacks show that at least some of them “ enjoyed naked lap dancers in daytona beach ” [ palm beach post ]. nudity is thus highly unlikely to provoke such a strong reaction in any remaining operatives as to cause them to jump up and announce themselves . <PARA> in a nutshell , those whose patriotism urges them to take action are well advised to do it with their clothes on . the neighbors might stand for such nonsense once , but trooping the colors every night at 7 p . m . would be pushing it . no need to unfurl old glory , in other words . <PARA> one of the ways humans deal with tragedy and times of uncertainty is to resort to humor . akin to the piece quoted above , this next bit first circulated in mid - october 2001 has caused many a smile : <PARA> the above is a parody of the mall risk rumor ( wherein the friend of a friend of a girl who was dating a now - disappeared afghani reports on a letter the jilted gal received that warned her not to take flights on september 11 or be in the malls on halloween ). though it should be obvious that any “ warning ” about stealth alligators organizing for a day of ass biting has to be a joke , our incoming mail proves otherwise — some have in all seriousness asked if this was a real threat they had to prepare for . perhaps these folks have never heard the saying about being “ up to your ass in alligators .” <PARA> finally , a punning bit of humor that nobody ( we know of ) has taken seriously :
false	a set of images purportedly showing president putin pilfering a pin - striped lollipop from a child have been circulating online for several years : <PARA> president putin did not steal a lollipop from this child . <PARA> the featured candy was digitally added to a set of photographs that were taken in january 2013 during a christmas service in sochi by getty images photographer mikhail klimentiev . a caption for one of the images explained that orthodox christians celebrate christmas on 7 january in the middle east , russia : <PARA> the genuine images went viral shortly after their publication as internet users noticed that the little boy looked scared in one of the photographs . when they were posted to reddit , for instance , they were shared under the title “ what could vladimir putin have said to this kid to leave him this terrified ?” <PARA> the humorous juxtaposition spurred some internet users to add funny captions to the image and when this set of photographs was posted to r / photoshopbattles , a subreddit dedicated to manipulated images , user “ theskabus ” posted the viral lollipop creation . <PARA> although the images of putin and the scared - looking child are real , we aren ’ t positive that they were taken in the order displayed above , or if they show the child ’ s reaction to something putin said or did . <PARA> video of the event does not show putin ’ s interaction with the child , and although these images are frequently shared in this order it ’ s impossible to tell how much time passed between the pictures .
false	in late april 2015 , the fake news outlet world news daily report published an article reporting that two central intelligence agency agents were arrested by “ minutemen ” at the mexican border while in possession of massive amounts of cocaine : <PARA> for unclear reasons , the claim began circulating widely on facebook in early may 2016 , one year after it was originally published . the image used by world news daily report dated back to at least 2014 , and was unrelated to any cia - involved incident at the border in 2015 . there is no truth to the claim , as is consistently the case with content created by that web site . <PARA> world news daily report publishes nothing but outlandish fabrications alongside unrelated photographs to drive traffic and boost ad revenue via social media shares . its disclaimer openly states that the site ’ s articles are made up of false information : <PARA> previous world news daily report hoaxes included claims that an infant was born with stigmata in the philippines , a lottery winner died after gold - plating his testicles , a 14 - year - old virgin was impregnated solely by a flu shot , a slaughterhouse employee killed dozens of coworkers unnoticed for twenty years , a donor heart recipient received an organ from an executed serial killer and went on to carry out a killing spree , a man ’ s genitals were bitten off during an attempted sexual assault of a pit bull , a meth - using babysitter ate a small child while high , a smithsonian employee was discovered “ raping ” a mummy , an overweight man sued golden corral because he was ejected for overstaying his welcome , rat meat was sold as chicken wings nationwide before the 2016 super bowl , a woman broke a world record by giving birth to 14 children by 14 different fathers , a nazi sub surfaced in the great lakes , a mother sued a tampon company for taking her daughter ’ s virginity , and a 101 - year - old italian woman gave birth to a healthy baby .
true	a group of researchers reported in october 2014 that the triatomine bug , a reduviid bug living in the united states , can carry a parasite that causes chagas disease . <PARA> examples : <PARA> melissa nolan garcia , a research associate at baylor college of medicine in houston , presented two studies at the annual meeting of the american society of tropical medicine and hygiene . for one study , garcia and her team collected 40 triatomine bugs in texas and discovered nearly 75 % of the bugs were carrying the parasite trypanosoma cruzi . for the second study , garcia ’ s team examined 17 blood donors who had symptoms consistent with chagas disease : <PARA> the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) believes nearly 300 , 000 people may be infected with the parasite trypanosoma cruzi in the united states . garcia believes this number may be higher , however , since many people infected with the disease are asymptomatic and undiagnosed : <PARA> the cdc has classified chagas disease as one of five neglected parasitic infections in the united states . chagas , as well as cysticercosis , toxocariasis , toxoplasmosis , and trichomoniasis , are considered npis in the united states since little attention has been dedicated to their surveillance , prevention , and treatment . <PARA> a cdc factsheet about npis in the united states reads : <PARA> triatomine bugs ( also called reduviid bugs , kissing bugs , assassin bugs , cone - nosed bugs , and blood suckers ) have been found in the southern united states , mexico , central america , and south america : <PARA> shortly after garcia reported her findings , several publications ran sensational headlines claiming chagas disease was the “ new aids .” although the threat is real , it is unlikely for someone in the united states to be infected by a kissing bug : <PARA> chagas disease can be fatal , but many people infected by trypanosoma cruzi never develop the disease and remain asymptomatic for life . according to the cdc , only about 30 % of infected people will “ develop debilitating and sometimes life - threatening medical problems over the course of their lives .” <PARA> a november 2015 report on the discovery of kissing bugs in georgia noted that there had not been a reported case of chagas in that state since 1855 : <PARA> in late february 2017 , the discovery of a chagas - infected kissing bug in lubbock , texas led to renewed interest in risks posed by the parasite , and in july 2017 the warning spread about “ barber beetles .”
unproven	in january 2019 , as political tensions rose over funding for president donald trump ’ s proposed border wall , reports emerged that an undocumented immigrant had been responsible for four killings in nevada . <PARA> on 21 january , president trump himself tweeted that “ four people in nevada viciously robbed and killed by an illegal immigrant who should not have been in our country ,” and used the case in support of his argument for the enhanced security infrastructure along the southern border , adding “ we need a powerful wall !”: <PARA> president trump and some of his supporters have consistently talked up the supposed risk to public safety from immigration across the southern u . s . border . however , studies have repeatedly shown that undocumented immigrants actually commit crimes , including violent crimes , at a lower rate than native - born u . s . citizens , as we have outlined in greater detail previously . <PARA> the day after trump ’ s tweet , the conservative “ constitution club ” facebook page posted a widely - shared meme featuring a photograph of an elderly nevada couple alleged to have been killed by the “ illegal immigrant ” in question : <PARA> “ rest in peace : gerold [ sic ] ( 81 ) and sharon david ( 80 ), shot and killed by an illegal immigrant during a home invasion / robbery in reno on 1 / 10 / 19 .” <PARA> on 19 january , the carson city sheriff ’ s office arrested wilber ernesto martinez - guzman , a citizen of el salvador , in connection with a series of burglaries and homicides in washoe and douglas counties in january 2019 . initial police statements described the suspect as being 19 years old , but carson city sheriff ’ s office records list his age as 20 . <PARA> martinez - guzman is suspected of being responsible for the shooting deaths of 56 - year - old connie koontz on 10 january , 74 - year - old sophia renken on 13 january , and gerald david ( 81 ) and his wife sharon david ( 80 ) on 16 january . <PARA> a spokesperson for the federal immigration and customs enforcement agency ( ice ) confirmed to snopes that martinez - guzman is an undocumented immigrant , writing in an email to us that : “ mr . martinez - guzman is a citizen of el salvador who entered the united states unlawfully on an unknown date and location . he has no prior criminal or immigration history . ice has lodged a detainer .” <PARA> ice files a detainer request with a local law enforcement agency when they have reason to believe that an individual is eligible to be deported from the united states , and ice formally asks that agency to notify ice in advance of the individual ’ s release from custody ( for example , after serving a prison sentence ) so that ice can then immediately take the person into custody and begin the deportation process . <PARA> martinez - guzman was initially charged in carson city with burglary and possession of stolen property in relation to his alleged actions at the david household in south reno , as well as immigration offences . as of 24 january , he had not been charged with murder , but local law enforcement officials have said they are “ confident [ they ] have evidence that will link him to all four homicides .” <PARA> on 24 january , the carson city district attorney added several additional charges . according to kolo - tv , those new charges included : <PARA> as of 24 january , martinez - guzman had not been charged with killing gerald and sharon david , connie koontz or sophia renken , nor had he offered his plea in response to the charges brought against him . notwithstanding the obvious confidence of law enforcement officials that martinez - guzman was responsible for the four killings in january 2019 , we cannot yet say whether or not he was guilty of them . <PARA> we can say for certain that he had entered the united states illegally and therefore was indeed an unauthorized immigrant according to ice , and that the davids were indeed shot dead according to a medical examiner . for these reasons , we issue an unproven rating in response to the claim that gerald and sharon david were “ shot and killed by an illegal immigrant .”
false	origins : every election cycle brings its share of subtle ( and not - so - subtle ) humor pieces proclaiming that measurements have determined one candidate ’ s intelligence to be much higher than another ’ s , or <PARA> that studies have found supporters of a particular candidate or party are , in general , significantly smarter as a group than supporters of the opposite party . it seems no satirical article that makes reference to a “ study ” ( usually conducted by a fictitious academic or political group ), no matter how broadly written , won ’ t be mistaken by some readers for a valid news report . ( a similar item from 2001 fooled many a news publication and is still occasionally cited as a genuine by gullible reporters .) <PARA> the item excerpted above provides plenty of clues that it is satirical in nature ( and about whom it ’ s satirizing ): besides its general premise regarding a supposedly inverse relationship between intelligence and support for president bush , it also notes that persons with iqs in the 60 - 80 range are more likely to support dale earnhardt , jr . ( a nascar driver ) than senator john kerry in the presidential election , that there is a “ direct correlation between the number of preset country western stations on car radios and bush ’ s approval rating ,” and that “ bush supporters argue against [ polls predicting an electoral college tie ] because the word college angers them .” <PARA> this article is in fact the work of politic satirist will durst , a 9 september 2004 example of one of the columns he publishes on a semi - weekly basis .
unproven	origins : many readers have asked us about an mpeg video clip ( see links below ), roughly a minute long , depicting a u . s . apache helicopter gunship firing at men in a field . the men are iraqis shown handling a long cylindrical object ; the accompanying audio indicates that the helicopter crew believes the object to be a weapon , so they <PARA> ask their commanders for permission to engage the enemy , then take out the three men one by one with the helicopter ’ s 30mm cannons , firing over 100 rounds in all . <PARA> all we know so far is what abcnews ( presumably the source of the video ) reported : the action depicted took place north of baghdad on 1 december 2003 , the soldiers heard on the tape are from the army ’ s 4th infantry division , and the men on the ground were fired upon because the helicopter crew believed them to be armed with rocket - propelled grenade launcher . according to abc : <PARA> a senior army official who viewed the tape said the pilots had the legal right to kill the men because they were carrying a weapon . he said there were no ground troops in the area and if the apache pilots had let the three iraqis go , the men might have gone on to kill american troops . <PARA> keane agreed . “ those weapons were obviously not being pointed at them in particular , but they [ the three iraqis ] are using those weapons in their minds for lethal means and they [ the apache pilots ] have a right to interfere with that ,” he said . <PARA> anthony cordesman , an abcnews defense consultant who also viewed the tape , said the apache pilots would have had a much clearer picture of the scene than what was recorded on the videotape . he also said they would have had intelligence about the identity of the men in the vehicles . “ they ’ re not getting a sort of blurred picture . they have a combination of intelligence and much better imagery than we can see .” <PARA> as to whether the apache pilots could have called in ground troops to apprehend the men , cordesman said : “ in this kind of war , wherever you find organized resistance among the insurgents , you have to act immediately . if you wait to send in ground troops almost invariably your enemy is going to be gone .” <PARA> army officials acknowledged that the 30 mm cannons used by the apache gunners were far bigger than what was needed to kill the men , but said it is the smallest weapon the apaches have . <PARA> keane agreed . “ those weapons were obviously not being pointed at them in particular , but they [ the three iraqis ] are using those weapons in their minds for lethal means and they [ the apache pilots ] have a right to interfere with that ,” he said . <PARA> anthony cordesman , an abcnews defense consultant who also viewed the tape , said the apache pilots would have had a much clearer picture of the scene than what was recorded on the videotape . he also said they would have had intelligence about the identity of the men in the vehicles . “ they ’ re not getting a sort of blurred picture . they have a combination of intelligence and much better imagery than we can see .” <PARA> as to whether the apache pilots could have called in ground troops to apprehend the men , cordesman said : “ in this kind of war , wherever you find organized resistance among the insurgents , you have to act immediately . if you wait to send in ground troops almost invariably your enemy is going to be gone .” <PARA> army officials acknowledged that the 30 mm cannons used by the apache gunners were far bigger than what was needed to kill the men , but said it is the smallest weapon the apaches have . <PARA> the video clip described above can be found on a variety of web sites . this following link was still active at last check :

mixture	one aspect of the olympic games many u . s . viewers remain unaware of is the fact that u . s . medalists ( like those from many other countries ) receive cash prizes along with their medals : $ 25 , 000 for gold , $ 15 , 000 for silver , and $ 10 , 000 for bronze . these rewards are not paid by the international olympic committee ( which furnishes the medals ), but by the u . s . olympic committee . similarly , participants from some other countries receive monetary prizes put up by their home countries ’ olympic committees . <PARA> forbes reported on the issue of medal bonuses in july 2012 , noting that : <PARA> in july 2012 , a blog post alerted many american readers to these prize winnings , noting that the monies earned by olympic athletes ( along with the value of their medals ) were considered taxable income and could require gold medal winners to shell out up to $ 9 , 000 to the irs . <PARA> while it is true that prize winnings ( including cash awards obtained through the attainment of olympic medals ) are considered taxable income in the u . s ., it ’ s unlikely any u . s . gold medal winner would incur a tax liability of anything close $ 9 , 000 per gold medal . for starters , that estimation was based upon the assumption that the winner would be paying a 35 % tax rate , which ( in 2012 ) only applied to persons earning more than $ 388 , 350 per year . <PARA> while some athletes may end up realizing incomes that put them into the higher tax brackets through endorsement deals or participation in professional versions of their sports , many athletes earn their medals in lower - profile events that don ’ t afford them such lucrative money - making opportunities . additionally , many athletes could probably write off their olympic prize winnings against the cost of their training and other related expenses , to the point that their tax liability for those winnings would be significantly lowered ( if not completely eliminated ). <PARA> that $ 9 , 000 figure was also based on the assumption that medal - winning athletes would be paying taxes on the monetary value of the medals themselves ( based on the types and amounts of metal the medals contain ), which as cbs news calculated ranged from about $ 5 to $ 644 : <PARA> the question of whether the value of olympic medals is a form of taxable income in the u . s . is still somewhat open . the financial post tackled the issue of whether canadian athletes were responsible for paying taxes on their winnings from the 2010 winter olympics , stating that : <PARA> even if the irs did consider the value of olympic medals to be a form of taxable income in the u . s ., it ’ s probably unlikely that agency would come after any athletes who didn ’ t declare that income on their returns , as reuters observed in an article on that topic : <PARA> over the years , members of congress have offered various proposals to exempt u . s . olympic medalists from being required to pay taxes on their winnings , without success so far . but they ’ re still trying , and on 12 july 2016 the u . s . senate passed a bill ( sb 2650 ) sponsored by senator john thune of south dakota titled “ united states appreciation for olympians and paralympians act ” that seeks to exclude as taxable income prize money and medals won through competition in the olympic games or paralympic games : <PARA> this bill still has to be passed by the u . s . house of representatives and signed by the president before becoming law .
mixture	a facet of u . s . history largely unfamiliar to americans themselves is the role of indentured servitude in the survival and growth of the original 13 colonies . the earliest settlers needed laborers , but only wealthy people could afford passage to the new world . this led to a system whereby those who lacked means were brought from europe under contract to work off their passage , room , and board over a period of two to seven years , until they were considered to have earned their freedom . no fewer than half of the immigrants who came to the new world during the colonial period arrived as indentured servants . <PARA> among the many thousands of impoverished europeans brought over in this fashion were men , women , and children from england , ireland , scotland , germany , and elsewhere , but over the intervening centuries the notion has arisen that the irish , in particular , were shipped to the new world as “ white slaves .” <PARA> in fact , according to an article first published on the internet in 2008 and endlessly recirculated since , irish slaves were not only common in early america , they were more common than african slaves , and often treated more harshly . the article making these claims is usually credited to an individual named john martin , who , in turn , found most of his “ facts ” in a 2003 article by james f . cavanaugh called “ irish slaves in the caribbean .” it has gone by many names , but as of mid - 2016 , the most shared version of the irish slave narrative was entitled “ irish : the forgotten white slaves ,” and posted under the byline of a man named ronald dwyer . <PARA> regardless of who is or isn ’ t credited with writing it , nearly every iteration of the piece begins in exactly the same way : <PARA> woven throughout is the implication that the reason so few americans know anything about the so - called “ forgotten ” history of irish slavery is that it has been excluded from “ biased ” history books . <PARA> limerick - based research librarian and historian liam hogan takes aim at this notion in a series of papers debunking what he calls “ the irish slaves myth .” there were no irish slaves in the americas , hogan says . people who claim there were are conflating indentured servitude with chattel slavery — two distinct forms of servitude with more differences between them than similarities : <PARA> hogan pins a 2014 resurgence of the irish slaves narrative to increasing racial tensions within the united states , situating it within a larger world view desirous of absolving white europeans of blame for the transatlantic slave trade that brought an estimated 12 million africans to the new world in lifelong bondage : <PARA> that the institution of chattel slavery in america was founded on race is undeniable . beginning in the late 1600s , the colonies all adopted “ slave codes ” which , among other things , routinely defined slaves as “ negro ” or “ african ,” according to the encyclopedia britannica : <PARA> the dred scott decision handed down by the supreme court in 1857 reaffirmed that racialized definition of slavery . the 7 to 2 decision in scott v . sanford held that plaintiff dred scott , a black slave , did not qualify as an american citizen and had no standing to sue in federal court because , in part , persons imported as slaves “ had for more than a century before been regarded as beings of an inferior order ”: <PARA> in terms of historical accuracy , the irish slave story is a hodgepodge . for example , the “ proclamation of 1625 ” supposedly requiring all irish prisoners to be sent overseas did not exist . you won ’ t find it in any history books . there was a 1603 proclamation by james i ordering that “ rogues , vagabonds , idle , and dissolute persons ” be “ banished and conveyed ” to “ places and parts beyond the seas ,” etc ., but this was not directed at the irish in particular . it was put to use decades later in the wake of the english civil wars , however , as a justification for forcibly shipping thousands of irish prisoners , vagrants , and orphans to the caribbean as indentured servants . more than any other , this historical fact inspired the notion that the irish were enslaved . still , the text wildly exaggerates the number of those treated in this fashion , falsely claiming that “ 300 , 000 were sold as slaves .” ( liam hogan unravels these and similar statistical misrepresentations in “ a review of the numbers in the irish slaves meme .”) <PARA> that thousands of irish people were carried across the sea against their will and indentured to serve on plantations isn ’ t disputed . it happened . what ’ s in question is whether or not they are rightly referred to as “ slaves .” some writers , such as genealogist and irish times columnist john grenham , ask why not : <PARA> is it mere quibbling ? generically speaking , any form of forced labor can be called slavery . but what do we gain by doing so , besides blurring historical distinctions ? consider impressment , the 18th - century british naval practice of kidnapping young men and forcing them to serve on sailing vessels . that ’ s slavery , in a sense . so is being sentenced to hard labor in prison . but while these share features in common with the institution of chattel slavery in america , they are on a whole separate plane . <PARA> it isn ’ t “ bias ” that keeps legitimate historians from substituting the term “ slavery ” for “ impressment ,” “ hard labor ,” or even “ forced indentured servitude .” it ’ s a simple respect for the facts .
false	castoreum ( or castor , not to be confused with the oil of a castor bean ) is a yellowish - brown , unctuous substance with a strong , penetrating odor which beavers secrete from castor sacs located in skin cavities between the pelvis and the base of the tail and spray when scent - marking their territory . ( the location of the beaver ’ s castor sacs means that castoreum also often includes a mixture of anal gland secretions and urine as well .) due to the beaver ’ s typical diet of leaves and bark , castoreum doesn ’ t “ stink ” as other similar animal secretions do , but rather has a musky , vanilla scent described at the perfume site fragrantica as a “ sharp spreading tar - like note that reminds one of the odor of birch tar or russian leather ” that when diluted in alcohol picks up “ more pleasant , musky and fruity nuances .” <PARA> because of its scent properties castoreum has long been employed in the perfume - making industry , and processed forms of castoreum have also been used as food additives , in the latter case primarily as enhancers of vanilla , strawberry and raspberry flavorings found in products such as iced tea , ice cream , gelatin , candy , fruit - flavored drinks , and yogurt . <PARA> however , the publicity afforded castoreum in recent years via alarmist food activists and “ did you know ?” social media posts is vastly overblown : <PARA> the use of castoreum in common food products today is exceedingly rare , in large part because collecting the substance is difficult ( and therefore expensive ): <PARA> according to fernelli ’ s handbook of flavor ingredients , total annual national consumption of castoreum , castoreum extract , and castoreum liquid combined is only about 292 pounds , which works out to an average of less than a millionth of a pound per person in the u . s . compare that figure with the approximately 20 million pounds of vanilla naturally harvested from real vanilla beans every year . depending upon as scarce a substance as castoreum to flavor the ice cream and candy found on store shelves would create nationwide shortages of those items and drive up their prices beyond the reach of all but the wealthiest consumers . <PARA> in 2011 , the vegetarian resource group ( vrg ) queried five companies that produce vanilla flavorings about whether they used any castoreum in their products , and all five replied that they did not : <PARA> castoreum as a food additive is classified by the food and drug administration as “ generally recognized as safe ” ( gras ), and therefore food manufacturers don ’ t always have to include castoreum in their ingredients lists and may instead refer to it as “ natural flavoring .” however yucky that may seem , according to a 2007 safety assessment published the international journal of toxicology , consumption of castoreum poses no health risk to humans : <PARA> castoreum does still have a significant market even today , but almost exclusively for the use of the perfume industry , not the food industry .
false	on 29 may 2004 , as part of the annual u . s . memorial day observances honoring those who died in our nation ’ s service , the long - awaited national world war ii memorial in washington , d . c ., was formally dedicated . ( the memorial had opened for public viewing a month prior to its official dedication ceremonies .) <PARA> to most americans — particularly those who lived through world war ii itself — no words associated with that conflict are more familiar or more stirring than those delivered by president franklin d . roosevelt as he stood before congress on 8 december 1941 , the day after the surprise attack by japanese forces on the u . s . naval base at pearl harbor in hawaii , and asked for a declaration of war against japan . accordingly , no american memorial to world war ii would be complete without a reproduction of at least a portion of president roosevelt ’ s memorable speech . <PARA> the message quoted below ( which looks to be a reworking of an item originally published in the washington times on 4 june 2004 ) claims that an excerpt from fdr ’ s 8 december 1941 speech which is inscribed on the side of the memorial dedicated to the war in the pacific deliberately excised the words ‘ so help us god ,’ as uttered by president roosevelt that day , because ‘ we ’ re not supposed to say things like that now ’: <PARA> ironically , this claim is apparently based on some anonymous person ’ s flawed recollection , the very sort of tampering with memory that the message warns us against . <PARA> here is the complete text of president roosevelt ’ s 8 december 1941 address to congress : <PARA> out of that twenty - four sentence speech , only a single sentence ( the one highlighted in red above ), prefaced by roosevelt ’ s famous opening words , is inscribed on the national world war ii memorial : <PARA> the sentence that concludes with the words “ so help us god ” ( highlighted in blue above ) is not the one inscribed on the memorial ; it is a completely different sentence that occurred later in the speech . the phrase “ so help us god ” was not excised from fdr ’ s speech ; it simply didn ’ t appear at all in the single representative sentence from that speech which was chosen to adorn the memorial . <PARA> as the national park service ( nps ) noted of the faux controversy :

mixture	one day after the pulse orlando nightclub shooting in june 2016 , the web site daily caller published an article reporting that a sitting member of the homeland security advisory council is a syrian immigrant who said that 9 / 11 “ changed the world for good ” and has “ consistently disparaged america ” on social media : <PARA> by 15 june 2016 , various versions of this story reported that president barack obama personally appointed alawa “ recently ” to “ the homeland security advisory council ’ s subcommittee on countering violent extremism ”: <PARA> all versions of claims about laila alawa appeared in conjunction with widespread reporting on the mass shooting in orlando , with some unreliable web sites claiming that president obama personally appointed alawa to a dhs role : <PARA> it is true that laila alawa ’ s name appears on a document titled “ countering violent extremism subcommittee membership roster ,” but ( contrary to what some outlets implied or stated ) that group was neither a “ task force ” nor was it connected to any law enforcement initiative . a 9 june 2016 , dhs issued a report that described a discussion - based meeting , “ an incubator of ideas ” that aimed “ to leverage outside expertise and new thinking to support and enhance as well as assist ” existing efforts . in other words , a roundtable discussion , not a law enforcement initiative , that took place well before the orlando nightclub shooting ( the linkage of the dhs subcommittee with the orlando shootings apparently occurred because the former released its report just a few days before the latter event ): <PARA> as usual , the daily caller made hay out of selectively quoting material to create impressions unsupported by facts for example : <PARA> apparently in the daily caller ‘ s view , the avoidance of “ muslim terminology ” is a really bad thing , something that laila alawa clearly had a hand in . but of course , the daily caller quoted nothing documenting how much of a hand laila alawa in making that particular recommendation ( she was but one of 15 people on the subcommittee ), nor why that recommendation was made . <PARA> a bit later , though , the daily caller did offer their own disingenuous explanation for that recommendation : <PARA> in fact , the dhs report made no mention of eschewing the use of such terms to “ avoid offending muslims .” rather , it suggested that the use “ plain meaning american english ” was preferable to jargon that is often poorly understood by americans : <PARA> the daily caller ‘ s “ original report ” on the matter also falsely stated : <PARA> in fact , the dhs report did not state that the subcommittee had “ instructed dhs not to use any language that might be disrespectful to muslims ,” nor did the referenced passage cite any particular words to be avoid . the report merely noted that multiple reports ( not just the report of this subcommittee ) had advised the avoidance of any language “ disrespectful of fellow americans ” ( muslim or otherwise ): <PARA> the daily caller also misreported another aspect of the dhs report , stating that : <PARA> but the report didn ’ t say that subcommittee members had advised the dhs to “ devote more attention ” to other groups . what the subcommittee suggested was that violent extremism and radicalization are not the province of any one group or ideology , and that the u . s . government should prioritize their efforts based on “ forms that pose the greatest threats to safety and security ”: <PARA> we contacted laila alawa ourselves for additional details about the issue , and she confirmed that president obama was not linked with her appointment to the subcommittee , adding that the daily caller had urged people to call for her to be fired from that appointment . what she was referencing was apparently a daily caller poll asking readers to vote on whether she should be fired : <PARA> ( contrary to some reports , alawa isn ’ t actually employed by the dhs in any capacity ; she heads a media organization called the tempest , “ created and run by diverse millennial women .”) <PARA> the daily caller also referenced or reproduced a 2014 tweet from alawa six different times in the course of their article , without once explicating what she meant by it ( thereby creating the misleading impression that it intended to be disparaging ): <PARA> alawa told us she didn ’ t mean that 9 / 11 had changed the world “ for the [ greater ] good ,” but that she meant the attack had changed the world “ forever .” she also disputed frequent characterizations of her as a “ syrian refugee ,” noting that she was around six years old when her family moved to japan before settling in the united states . alawa is 24 ( not 25 , as is often stated ), and her move to the u . s . occurred well before the recent mass exodus of refugees from the strife in syria .

mixture	most household air conditioning units work by using a vapor - compression refrigeration system . in such systems , a mixture of chemicals known as a refrigerant is contained in liquid form under pressure , and when that mixture is pumped into a region of lower pressure , it expands and changes phase into a gas , absorbing nearby heat before being pumped to a different location . the gas is then recompressed and this process begins anew . <PARA> the first widely used refrigerants were chlorofluorocarbons , also known as cfcs . in the 1970s , however , the scientific community determined that cfcs were building up in the earth ’ s upper atmosphere in a way that damaged the ozone layer , lessening the planet ’ s natural protection from some forms of solar radiation . in 1987 , 27 countries therefore signed a global environmental treaty called the montreal protocol to reduce substances that deplete the ozone layer . under this treaty , signatories pledged to reduce the use of ozone - depleting compounds ( such as halons and cfcs ) to below 50 % of 1987 levels by the year 2000 . <PARA> one of the most widely used replacements for cfcs were chemicals known as hydrochlorofluorocarbons ( hcfcs ), and this substitution largely made the phase - out of cfcs possible . unfortunately , many hcfcs , including hcfc - 22 ( a principal component of the trade name product “ freon ”) contribute both to global warming and can , to a lesser degree , serve to deplete the ozone layer as well . <PARA> for this reason , montreal protocol signatories agreed to accelerate the phase - out of these products in 2007 . in the united states ’ case , this meant that the environmental protection agency ( epa ) mandated no new hcfc - 22 - based air conditioning systems be manufactured or installed after 1 january 2010 , and the import or production of hcfc - 22 be completely halted a decade later . <PARA> newer a / c machines are required to use ozone - friendly refrigerants . the most common replacement for hcfc - 22 in the united states is r - 410a , which does not harm the ozone layer but is considered a greenhouse gas . <PARA> all of these changes , however , are being made on the production side of operations , not the consumer end . if you have an older air conditioning unit , you will likely find it becoming increasingly harder to service in the future , but you will not be required to replace it soon than you have to :

false	origins : mentos , a candy that has a soft , chewy interior encased in a slightly hard shell , is no longer just for noshing on — when combined with a carbonated beverage in a closed environment that <PARA> has a small opening ( think “ soda bottle ”), it serves to produce a frothy geyser that shoots many feet into the air , a secondary use of the product that has served to enthrall countless persons with a penchant for making things explode . <PARA> the combination of any carbonated liquid and mint - flavored mentos will rapidly produce copious amounts of foam because the candy works to disrupt the surface tension of the liquid , thereby releasing all the drink ’ s fizz ( carbon dioxide ) in one surprisingly speedy whoosh . the resulting effect is quick , high , and explosive , yet what takes place is not a chemical reaction but a physical one ( even though some are moved to believe the confection ’ s gum arabic component or diet soda ’ s aspartame has something to do with the process ). as steve spangler , former high school science teacher turned hands - on science guru , explained : “ the mentos effect has nothing to do with the inside of the mentos and everything to <PARA> do with the outside .” the candy ’ s shell is pocked with little nooks and crannies the beverage ’ s carbon dioxide molecules are immediately drawn to , and the confection ’ s relatively large surface area provides infinitely more such nooks and crannies ( nucleation sites ) than , say , an m & m would . <PARA> as for what happens when carbonated beverage encounters mentos , when a roll of the sweets is dropped into a two - liter bottle of diet coke , the combination works to produce an impressive geyser of brown froth that shoots about 20 feet into the air ( although some of these pressurized fountains have attained even greater height ). diet cola of any manufacture is regarded as the liquid of choice for creating a “ mentos eruption ” or “ mentos effect ” because a cola ’ s brown color serves to make the reaction much more starkly dramatic in all its explosive glory , and diet versions of those sodas don ’ t leave the same sticky residue that their sugared counterparts do ( an aspect well worth considering when contemplating spraying a wide area that you may afterward be called upon to clean ). plus , some folks swear diet sodas make for higher geysers . <PARA> numerous video clips of “ mentos eruptions ” exist on the internet ; one needn ’ t search all that diligently to stumble across scads of them . <PARA> not all such videos found on the web are on the up - and - up , however , including the famed “ pepsi girl ” clip , which purports to document a demise caused by the ingestion of a mixture of mentos and coca - cola . which brings us back to this article ’ s topic , the ballyhooed death of a youngster who consumed this combination . <PARA> this alert about an unnamed child in brazil ’ s sorry fate began circulating on the internet in november 2006 . since no <PARA> checkable details are provided in the account ( the deceased is described as “ a little boy ” rather than by name , he died in “ brazil ” rather than in any particular city or region within that country , and his demise occurred “ last week ” rather than on a specific date ), the story should be regarded as fiction . no news accounts of such a death ( in brazil or elsewhere ) have surfaced , and given the media ’ s interest in “ mentos effects ,” such write - ups wouldn ’ t have gasped their last on a jaded editor ’ s desk because they weren ’ t deemed sufficiently newsworthy to include in that day ’ s edition of the local rag . likewise , with regard to “ one year before the same accident happened with another boy in brazil ,” once again the news is silent regarding such a death . <PARA> however , the failure of this explosive combination of candy and soda to cause any fatalities should not be taken as a ringing endorsement of chasing down a handful of mentos with as much pop as can be gulped . a harmless procedure it ’ s clearly not — one look at online video clips of the force of “ mentos effect ” eruptions shooting out of pop bottles should convince even the most adventurous not to risk any part of their digestive systems on such parlor tricks . those who have disregarded common sense and tried such anyway report that the intensity of the reaction forces the mouth open , thereby releasing most of the gas and foam into the wild , as it were , rather than keeping them contained within the person . do not try such experiments yourself though . videos of those who have attempted such foolishness consistently show the subjects experiencing great physical distress in the aftermath of their ill - judged stunts . <PARA> the “ child who died from combining mentos and coca - cola ” story is an updating of an older legend that began in 1979 . that year , the grist being run through the rumor mill included the sad tale of a misadventuring tot who had gulped soda and ingested pop rocks , a carbonated candy known for producing a fizzling sensation in the mouth . according to legend , said child went out with a bang . further versions of the story specified the deceased youngster was the taciturn “ mikey ” of life cereal commercials . <PARA> once again there hadn ’ t been such a child , but that did little to slow the rumor ’ s spread . the gruesome appeal of the combusted tot story kept the legend in circulation long after it had been repeatedly debunked and dismissed . <PARA> barbara “ fizzical attraction ” mikkelson
false	on 16 march 2017 , conservative legal activism group judicial watch published a blog post in which they claimed the internal revenue service had favored “ after school satan ” secularist clubs by “ fast tracking ” their tax exempt status : <PARA> although judicial watch claims to have obtained documents that prove their claim , the documents they provide do no such thing ; they obtained filings for reason alliance , a nonprofit organization that sponsors the after school satan clubs , but the clubs were not created until two years later and do not have their own independent nonprofit status . <PARA> judicial watch obtained and published an application by reason alliance ltd for tax exempt status which was signed on 21 october 2014 . they also published the irs ’ s response notifying the group they had been approved for status as a “ private foundation ” on 31 october 2014 . neither the letter from the irs or the application make mention of after school satan clubs or the “ fast tracking ” of the application . <PARA> according to a statement released by the satanic temple , an activist group that created the after school satan program in 2016 to counter a bible study group in public schools , the clubs were sponsored by reason alliance to pay for things like operating costs and insurance : <PARA> the satanic temple is a secular activist group that leverages the legal system to promote plurality and counter what they view as overreach by christianity in the public sphere ( they do not promote worshiping satan or anyone else , but have seven tenets that are similar to secular humanist beliefs ). their co - founder and spokesman lucien greaves told us that neither the satanic temple nor the after school satan clubs sought or received tax - exempt status . reason alliance was created in 2014 to be a place “ where donors who support tst ’ s tenets and who want tax deductions for donations can have an entity to donate to .” <PARA> the satanic temple is known for bringing legal challenges against religious monuments by seeking to place their own goat - headed statue of baphomet nearby and placing pentagrams next to nativity scenes during the holiday season . pushback against their tactics often results in acknowledgement that “ religious freedom ” refers to more than mainstream beliefs . true to form , the satanic temple launched a nationwide campaign in the summer of 2016 establishing after school satan clubs in public schools that had good news clubs , evangelist after - school christian clubs for schoolchildren . the washington post was the first to break the story on 30 july 2016 : <PARA> greaves sent us a copy of one of the first letters sent by the organization to a school district asking to operate a “ satan club ” on school grounds . the letter is dated 1 august 2016 , and was sent to the superintendent of neah - kah - nie school district in rockaway beach , oregon : <PARA> forbes contributor and certified public accountant peter j . reilly wrote on 26 march 2017 that the timeframe from which the group submitted their application to when they received approval was probably influenced by the fact the irs had been criticized over 2013 allegations that staffers had discriminated against conservative groups . the agency ’ s response was to create an expedited process for small organizations to more swiftly acquire an approval or denial on their tax - exempt status : <PARA> we found no evidence to support the claim that after school satan clubs were the beneficiaries of “ fast tracking ” by the irs to help them swiftly gain tax exempt status .
unproven	examples : [ collected via facebook , april 2015 ] <PARA> i told my friend to use this recipe — and she was engaged 2 weeks later . so maybe not 24 hrs , but it made me a believer . <PARA> origins : in popular culture , the foot - tapping , marriage - minded girlfriend is a common trope , <PARA> representing ( frustration with ) the notion that a woman ’ s prospects of marriage are dependent upon her reluctant husband - to - be ’ s getting down on one knee and “ popping the question ” before any wedding can take place , and that women are afforded little input as to when ( or whether ) such a relationship transition will occur . in the absence of an <PARA> ability to meaningfully participate in the process , therefore , some women give heed to the idea that they could benefit from some deus ex machina - style intervention to hurry things along . <PARA> proposal - inducing tips and tricks are not new , but in 2003 glamour magazine added a novel twist to the genre by publishing a recipe known as “ engagement chicken ,” a dish to be prepared by impatient brides tired of waiting for their reluctant boyfriends to cough up a sparkly ring . the recipe is supposed to facilitate the traversal of a shorter path to the altar ; and according to many of its adherents , a menu of engagement chicken is often soon followed by marriage . <PARA> the glossy magazine ran the recipe in their january 2004 issue ( on newsstands in december 2003 ). at the time of its publication , the recipe got a signal boost from talk radio host howard stern , who spoke on - air of a dinner prepared for him by then - girlfriend beth ostrosky . as stern described the meal , a female caller ( and apparent glamour reader ) dropped a dime on ostrosky and her proposal plot : <PARA> stern immediately called his girlfriend , live on the air , and told her the jig was up . “ i was busted ,” admits ostrosky , who had torn the title off the recipe page as a precaution , just in case stern happened to see it lying around . <PARA> still , her ruse worked . about three years later , on feb . 14 , 2007 , her radio - personality beau ( who famously vowed never to marry again ) popped the question . <PARA> according to glamour contributor kimberly bonnell , <PARA> before the engagement chicken recipe appeared in that magazine in late 2003 , it had first been passed around in the magazine ’ s offices . as a result , three impatient girlfriends had finally been the recipients of marriage proposals : <PARA> so this chicken popped into my head when assistants worried about their date - night menus , and i shared it with them , spelling out every teeny little step . success ! they ’ d report back the next morning about foolproof results and rave reviews . <PARA> and , it seemed , betrothals . maybe not that very night but with unmistakably related - to - chicken timing . with an eerie predictability , women became engaged to the men for whom they prepared this chicken . voila : engagement chicken . <PARA> a page on glamour ‘ s web site dated 2006 has since been appended with many comments endorsing engagement chicken ‘ s power as a proposal precipitator : <PARA> 3 years ago i started to date this guy i really liked . he came to visit me for my birthday so i decided to make this recipe . this guy ended up being a jerk towards me that weekend at my house . i figured either this supposed recipe was full of crap or i just wasted the magic . i had a friend from a while back come over the next day and he stayed around for dinner , which i was eating the leftovers of the chicken . he and i just got married this past nov . i guess it really is magical . <PARA> i made this in may and my boyfriend proposed in november ... does that count ? <PARA> ummn definitely made this just because i thought it was a good recipe , had no alterior motives , 2 hours later he proposed !!! <PARA> worked for me ! i was engaged 17 weeks later . it could just be the magic of believing , but whatever it is , it ’ s tasty and worth a try <PARA> sounds kind of crazy , and i was very skeptical ... but it works ! i made this and my boyfriend proposed 64 days later ! i did modify it slightly .. in step 3 , i placed lemons and some of the herbs ( sage , thyme , and rosemary ) inside the cavity of the chicken . <PARA> i just made the chicken he ’ s eating it tomorrow we have been together 4 years in january and we have 2 kids !!! i caught the bouquet in april from his lil brothers wedding so i hope that and this chicken helps speed it up !!!! been patiently waiting for a long time now !!!! <PARA> in 2011 , the magazine published a video about the engagement chicken legend to promote a then - new cookbook and claimed 70 couples became engaged as a result of the recipe : <PARA> according to the experiences quoted above , the engagement chicken rumor seemingly serves a useful function for those who set out to harness its magic : not so much inspiring a proposal as ameliorating the frustration many would - be brides feel as they wait for a ring to materialize and a wedding date to appear on the horizon . much like a dentist ’ s shaking a patient ’ s cheek to conceal the sting of a novocaine shot , engagement chicken offers a welcome distraction to fretful partners hoping to transmute a passive waiting experience into a proactive pursuit . <PARA> as evidenced by the “ success stories ” shared above , the desired payoff of engagement chicken has often followed only after the passage of months or years . the broad periods of time within which the recipe has “ worked ” indicates that something other than chicken was the likely cause , but such tales have proved powerful magic for those eagerly anticipating overdue proposals .
true	origins : americans ( and others ) have certainly opened their wallets as well as their hearts to help the victims of the september 11 terrorist attacks — at last estimate , more than $ 1 . 2 billion had been donated to a variety of charities on their behalf . unfortunately , a good deal of that money hasn ’ t ( and doesn ’ t ) end up in the hands of those for whom it was intended . that state of affairs is due to a number of reasons , primarily : <PARA> the red cross , especially , has drawn a great deal of criticism for reportedly setting aside upwards of $ 200 million — which it solicited for its “ liberty fund ” by saying that all monies would be sent directly to victims ’ families — on other long - term programs such as blood storage , assistance to needy reservist and national guard families , community outreach programs , and funds for victims of future terrorist attacks . in response , the american red cross has halted solicitations for september 11 victims , brought in an outside auditor to review the organization ’ s spending and announced that it may triple cash gifts to families who lost loved ones on september 11 . on 26 october , red cross president and ceo dr . bernadine healy also resigned ( or was forced out ) in a dispute over the management of funds . eliot spitzer , the new york state attorney general , has proposed registering victims ’ families and other survivors in a database to allow charities to reach out to them instead of their having to find the appropriate charities , and the red cross has been criticized for “ refusing ” to participate in this program . <PARA> the red cross has responded to the allegations outlined above on its “ myths and facts ” page . <PARA> media critics such as foxnews ’ bill o ’ reilly have also taken the united way to task for having distributed less than $ 35 million of the $ 250 million taken in ( and for not giving the money directly to the families of victims ), prompting a feud with some of the celebrities who took part in benefits to raise money for that organization . the united way ’ s web site displays an accounting of the monies disbursed from the september 11th fund established by united way of new york city and the new york community trust .

55 and 1958 - 59 , is taken from david h . albert ’ s 1985 book , people power : applying nonviolence theory . however , albert ’ s book includes no annotations or footnotes to indicate from where he obtained the information that the ‘ feed thine enemy ’ campaign influenced eisenhower ’ s thinking and to explain how peace activists “ learned a decade later that the campaign played a significant , perhaps even determining role in preventing nuclear war .” presumably , albert ’ s source was a 1974 interview with alfred hassler , the general secretary of the international fellowship of reconciliation , as published in the for ’ s house magazine , fellowship : <PARA> do you remember for ’ s campaign in ’ 54 and ’ 55 ? there ’ s a story we haven ’ t told very often because it was told to us in great confidence — but that was nearly twenty years ago . <PARA> there was a famine in china , extremely grave . we urged people to send president eisenhower small sacks of grain with the message , ‘ if thine enemy hunger , feed him . send surplus food to china .’ the surplus food , in fact , was never sent . on the surface , the project was an utter failure . <PARA> but then – quite by accident – we learned from someone on eisenhower ’ s press staff that our campaign was discussed at three separate cabinet meetings . also discussed at each of these meetings was a recommendation from the joint chiefs of staff that the united states bomb mainland china in response to the quemoy -

hand account obtained from an anonymous source and not disclosed until twenty years after the fact , and as such its probative value is quite marginal . the anecdote as given appears to be a garbled account of a 1954 effort undertaken by the fellowship of reconciliation to have small bags of wheat ( not rice ) sent to the white house for the purpose of prompting the eisenhower administration to undertake relief efforts on behalf of china , where a catastrophic flood on the yangtze river had left thousands homeless and hungry . nothing in contemporary news accounts of the 1955 ‘ feed thine enemy ’ effort mentions the campaign ’ s being tied to an anti - war cause — the issue was that since china had declined aid from international relief organizations ( such as the red cross ) and would not allow private voluntary organizations from the “ free world ” into the country to supervise the distribution of food and other supplies , the fellowship of reconciliation ’ s director felt that the u . s . government should extend a “ no strings attached ” offer of assistance to the chinese government . <PARA> as the new york times reported in march 1955 : <PARA> the administration has another wheat problem . <PARA> this time it is hundreds of bags of wheat . they are tiny bags , weighing about two ounces , and are addressed to president eisenhower at the white house . <PARA> the bags carry the inscription : “ if thine enemy hunger , feed him .” in smaller letters are the words : “ send surplus food to china .” <PARA> the bags are being mailed to the white house from all over the country . they come from citizens who have responded to the appeal of the fellowship of reconciliation , 21 audubon avenue , manhattan . <PARA> this organization started its drive for the administration to heed st . paul ’ s injunction and send surplus foodstuffs to red china after the yangtze river flood of last summer . the flood left thousands homeless and in need . <PARA> the fellowship [‘ s director , alfred hassler ] stated that an offer “ with no political strings attached ” would be hard for the peiping government to refuse . <PARA> the organization also said that distribution should be left to the chinese government “ even though we might feel that we could do it better , and even though we fear that some food might be diverted to other ends .” <PARA> “ part of the world problem america faces is the suspicion on the part of asians and others that we think we can do everything better than they ,” the fellowship said . <PARA> that the red chinese government had not asked for aid is “ hardly significant ,” mr . hassler wrote . <PARA> “ on the other hand ,” he said , “ the fact that the united states has offered help freely to ‘ friendly ’ nations stricken by similar disasters but not to china , is significant .” <PARA> this time it is hundreds of bags of wheat . they are tiny bags , weighing about two ounces , and are addressed to president eisenhower at the white house . <PARA> the bags carry the inscription : “ if thine enemy hunger , feed him .” in smaller letters are the words : “ send surplus food to china .” <PARA> the bags are being mailed to the white house from all over the country . they come from citizens who have responded to the appeal of the fellowship of reconciliation , 21 audubon avenue , manhattan . <PARA> this organization started its drive for the administration to heed st . paul ’ s injunction and send surplus foodstuffs to red china after the yangtze river flood of last summer . the flood left thousands homeless and in need . <PARA> the fellowship [‘ s director , alfred hassler ] stated that an offer “ with no political strings attached ” would be hard for the peiping government to refuse . <PARA> the organization also said that distribution should be left to the chinese government “ even though we might feel that we could do it better , and even though we fear that some food might be diverted to other ends .” <PARA> “ part of the world problem america faces is the suspicion on the part of asians and others that we think we can do everything better than they ,” the fellowship said . <PARA> that the red chinese government had not asked for aid is “ hardly significant ,” mr . hassler wrote . <PARA> “ on the other hand ,” he said , “ the fact that the united states has offered help freely to ‘ friendly ’ nations stricken by similar disasters but not to china , is significant .” <PARA> herbert l . pankratz , a helpful archivist at the us national archives and records administration ( nara ), provided additional corroborating information via e -

emptive nuclear strike against the communist chinese ; no “ food for china ” campaign could possibly have been instrumental in dissuading him against choosing options he was never considering in the first place . moreover , it ’ s simply wrong to assert that a “ food for china ” campaign prompted eisenhower to decide that “ he certainly wasn ’ t going to consider using nuclear weapons against [ the chinese ],” as he had already publicly stated that he most definitely would use them if the communist chinese invaded quemoy and matsu : <PARA> at eisenhower ’ s march 16 [ 1955 ] news conference , charles von fremd of cbs asked him to comment on [ secretary of state ] dulles ’ assertion that in the event of war in the far east , “ we would probably want to make use of some tactical nuclear weapons .” eisenhower was unusually direct in his answer : “ yes , of course they would be used .” he explained , “ in any combat where these things can be used on strictly military targets and for strictly military purposes , i see no reason why they shouldn ’ t be used just exactly as you would use a bullet or anything else .” <PARA> even if eisenhower were aware of the “ food for china ” campaign , and even if he made the comment attributed to him ( which might have been offered in jest , for all we know ), it would be a very large stretch of the truth to claim that his decision - making was influenced by mailed - in bags of wheat , because the situation never developed to the point where he had to make decisions . his strategy throughout the formosa strait crises was to hold back until circumstances forced him to act , and they never did : <PARA> eisenhower ’ s handling of the quemoy - matsu crisis was a tour de force , one of the great triumphs of his long career . the key to his success was his deliberate ambiguity and deception . as robert devine writes , “ the beauty of eisenhower ’ s policy is that to this day no one can be sure whether or not he would have responded militarily to an invasion of the offshore islands , and whether he would have used nuclear weapons .” the full truth is that eisenhower himself did not know . in retrospect , what stands out about eisenhower ’ s crisis management is that at every stage he kept his options open . flexibility was one of his chief characteristics as supreme commander in world war ii ; as president , he insisted on retaining that flexibility . he never knew himself just how he would respond to an invasion of quemoy and matsu , because he insisted on waiting to see the precise nature of the attack before deciding to react . what he did know was that when the moment of decision came , he would have the maximum number of options to choose from . <PARA> additional information : <PARA> last updated : 5 january 2008 <PARA> <PARA> sources : <PARA> additional information :

false	origins : this legend began its internet life after it was posted to the newsgroup alt . smokers . cigars in early 1996 , and it has continued to circulate as a “ true story ” in newsgroups , e - mail , and social media ever since , despite its having been long ago identified as a tall tale . the version posted back in 1996 was , in fact , nearly identical to one that had been published in a collection of amusing anecdotes over thirty years earlier : <PARA> a man bought several boxes of cigars and had them insured against fire . when he had smoked them , he put in a claim against the insurance company that they had been destroyed by fire . <PARA> the company refused to pay , and the man sued . the judge ruled that the company had given the man a policy protecting against fire , and must pay . <PARA> as soon as the man accepted the money , the company had him arrested on a charge of arson . <PARA> the company refused to pay , and the man sued . the judge ruled that the company had given the man a policy protecting against fire , and must pay . <PARA> as soon as the man accepted the money , the company had him arrested on a charge of arson . <PARA> another anecdote from that same volume suggests this legend stemmed from a joke whose basic premise had been used in a few different ways : <PARA> “ he ’ s the kind of accountant you ’ ve got to admire . last year he deducted eighty cartons of cigarettes from my income tax . called it loss by fire !” <PARA> sometimes , as in this 2006 example , the basic legend is given a darker ending : <PARA> a north carolina man was on the top of the world , a self - proclaimed smart guy who made money by finding the loopholes in laws . he bought a $ 15 , 000 box of vintage imported cigars and took out an insurance policy , just like he did for his other valuables , protecting them against hazards , including fire . once he finished smoking the two dozen cigars in the box , he filed an insurance claim , stating that the cigars had been “ consumed ” by fire . <PARA> the insurance company took him to court but was ordered to pay the man his claim because his policy did not specify the exact nature of fire it covered or excluded . the man jauntily stepped into the bank with his check . however , the moment he cashed it , he was arrested , charged , and convicted of twenty - four counts of arson — one for each cigar . unable to find a loophole , he was sent to prison for two years , where he met his demise in an argument over a book of matches . <PARA> the insurance company took him to court but was ordered to pay the man his claim because his policy did not specify the exact nature of fire it covered or excluded . the man jauntily stepped into the bank with his check . however , the moment he cashed it , he was arrested , charged , and convicted of twenty - four counts of arson — one for each cigar . unable to find a loophole , he was sent to prison for two years , where he met his demise in an argument over a book of matches . <PARA> in 2003 the legend was made into a song and recorded by brad paisley . <PARA> as to whether there could <PARA> be any truth to the legend ’ s <PARA> premise , we note that insurance policies are generally written so that deliberate actions on the part of the policyholders cannot trigger payouts . furthermore , destroying your own property isn ’ t arson , as long as the act isn ’ t intended to defraud anyone . if a court had already ruled that the insurance company was required to pay , then it had been determined no fraud was committed , and thus the burning could not be considered arson . <PARA> the structure of this legend — a person ’ s exploiting a regulation for personal gain , then being punished under an unforeseen aspect of that regulation — is similar to the collegiate legend about cakes and ale .
unproven	on 15 november 2016 , infowars , the web site belonging to conspiracy theorist and alternative supplement salesman alex jones shared a story claiming that democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton had to be restrained during a violent outburst after being defeated by her rival , donald trump in the 8 november 2016 election : <PARA> the only source for the story , and versions being shared on other unreliable sites , are the tweets of todd kincannon , a controversial figure who has gained notoriety by trolling on twitter , famously opining in 2013 : “ this super bowl sucks more dick than adult trayvon martin would have for drug money .” on 14 november 2016 , kincannon celebrated the death of pbs journalist gwen ifill , then responded to resulting ire by saying , “ i trigger liberals for fun and profit . you should try it .” <PARA> it ’ s unclear if the tantrum story was more “ triggering ” or a claim kincannon intended to be taken seriously . he tweeted that an unnamed cnn journalist was blocked from reporting the tantrum by his editors . there is no video provided and no other witnesses corroborating the account : <PARA> infowars attempts to shore up kincannon ’ s claim by citing crisis of character , a book written by former secret service agent gary byrne , which the association of former agents blasted as being politically motivated and possibly untrue because byrne ’ s rank wouldn ’ t have allowed him close enough access to the clintons to see what he claims he saw . <PARA> this is not the first time an unsupported claim that clinton threw a temper tantrum has surfaced . various unreliable web sites claimed clinton went into a curse - filled tirade and threw a glass at a staffer after becoming enraged at nbc host matt lauer ’ s questions during a 2016 forum . while the clinton camp was reportedly unhappy with lauer ’ s questions , there are no reliable reports clinton became violent or profane .
mixture	during the 2016 presidential campaign , an image macro circulated online holding that mike pence , the governor of indiana and republican vice presidential nominee , had signed a state bill in 2013 that allowed same - sex couples to be jailed simply for applying for marriage licenses : <PARA> indiana house bill 1006 , as it was known , amended the indiana code to downgrade the classification of various offenses , including “ knowingly furnish [ ing ] false information to a clerk of the circuit court ” while applying for a marriage license , from class d to level 6 felonies , in accordance with the state ’ s revised classification system for felonies . this action neither created a new law nor specified a harsher penalty for the existing law . <PARA> however , the revisions also included a clause that spurred concerns that it would be applicable to , and penalize , anyone who performed a same - sex wedding ceremony : <PARA> as mic noted at the time , the new law was widely misreported as being specific to same - sex couples : <PARA> moreover , legal writers have challenged the suggestion that the law could effectively be applied to penalize any same - sex couple who simply applied for a marriage license : <PARA> same - sex marriage has been legal in indiana since 6 october 2014 , when the supreme court declined to hear an appeal in the case of baskin v . bogan . we contacted the indiana state attorney general ’ s office on 9 november 2016 to confirm whether any same - sex couples have indeed been prosecuted under the terms of hb 1006 but have yet to hear back .
unproven	in a vatican ceremony on 4 september 2016 , pope francis conferred sainthood upon mother teresa , the albanian - born nun who famously devoted most of her life to ministering to the poor in india until her death in 1997 at the age of 87 . he described her as a “ model of holiness ” and “ generous dispenser of divine mercy ,” citing , among other qualifications , mother teresa ’ s unwavering opposition to abortion in any form . “ she was committed to defending life ,” the pope said , “ ceaselessly proclaiming that ‘ the unborn are the weakest , the smallest , the most vulnerable .'” <PARA> for americans , the canonization of mother teresa coincided with the home stretch of the 2016 presidential campaign , in which the two principal candidates , along with their parties , have taken opposite stands on the issue of abortion . republican donald trump has declared himself “ pro - life ” and supports legal sanctions to “ protect the unborn ,” while democrat hillary clinton says she ’ s committed to protecting “ women ’ s access to critical health services , including safe , legal abortion .” <PARA> the timing of the resurrection of an old anecdote about a meeting between hillary clinton and mother teresa — an anecdote some have called “ apocryphal ” even while passing it along — was probably not so coincidental . <PARA> most versions tie the story to a national prayer breakfast hosted by the clinton administration in 1994 , at which mother teresa was invited to speak and did not mince words about her feelings on abortion : <PARA> after the speech , mother teresa and first lady hillary clinton — who , needless to say , held disparate opinions on the topic of the day — briefly conversed , as recalled by clinton in her 2003 memoir , living history : <PARA> according to the anecdote that concerns us today , there was another verbal back - and - forth between clinton and mother teresa on that occasion ( or perhaps it was another occasion — there are varying versions of events ), which began with the first lady quizzing the future saint about , of all things , gender and politics : <PARA> it ’ s an exchange hillary clinton would vividly remember , one would think , yet she neglected to mention it in her memoir , nor has she ever spoken of it in public speeches or interviews . it doesn ’ t appear in biographies of clinton or mother teresa . ( the question of why the u . s . hadn ’ t yet seen a woman as president also seems a rather implausible query for hillary clinton to have posed to a conservative albanian - indian roman catholic nun .) <PARA> the source most frequently cited by those spreading the story during the 2016 presidential campaign is an essay by educator sean fitzpatrick that appeared in the catholic journal crisis magazine on 20 january 2016 . fitzpatrick used the anecdote as an epigraph without specifying where he found it . when we contacted him and asked for his help to authenticate it , fitzpatrick replied that he has heard it told on many occasions over the years but doesn ’ t know of a definitive source . <PARA> he pointed us to a few other iterations of the tale online , however , which at least led a few years further back , such as this variant published in the evansville , indiana courier & press on 11 march 2010 : <PARA> in this case , as in some others we found , the storyteller was identified as pro - life activist shawn carney , though we ’ ve no reason to think the story originated with him . it appears , in fact , to be standard fare at pro - life gatherings . here is a mention from october 2010 : <PARA> we haven ’ t yet come across any instances of the story being told before 2009 , however . one of the earliest examples is in a blog post written by ohio congressman steve chabot in october of that year : <PARA> but none of the leads we ’ ve followed converge on a single source , much less an authoritative one . there doesn ’ t seem to be a source . it ’ s just “ that story about that time hillary clinton got schooled by mother teresa ” people tell at pro - life events . it is told consistently , mind you — apart from small details — but such is the case with most anecdotes this pointed and this short , regardless of whether they ’ re true or false . until we encounter a citation that names an eyewitness source — or , better yet , quotes one — we ’ re labeling the authenticity of this story unproven .
unproven	examples : <PARA> here is a story that i have heard from time to time . a man has a couple tickets to a home game of a football team that is having a lousy season . ( i have heard variously the indianapolis colts , atlanta falcons , and the tampa bay buccaneers , among others , but usually it is a professional american football team .) he tries to sell them , but doesn ’ t get a nibble . he tries giving them away , but nobody will take them . finally , the day before the game , he goes shopping , and places the tickets on his windshield in hopes that somebody will pick them up . he remains at the store ( or visits several places ) for a few hours to give the tickets more exposure . when he gets back to his car , though , he discovers that , not only has nobody taken the tickets , but someone left two more ! <PARA> [ ducibella , 1998 ] <PARA> a man had a ticket to a recent home game . he parked his car and walked a mile to the stadium before he realized that he had left it on the dashboard of his car . racing back , his worst fears were realized . someone had seen the ticket , smashed his windshield — and left four more tickets next to his . <PARA> origins : this legend about tickets to a woefully underperforming team ’ s home game attracting even more tickets to that event rather than themselves being scooped up and made off with by grateful fans has been around for dogs ’ years . it has likely been told of every sports team to have experienced multi - year slumps because it so perfectly captures what lies deep in the hearts of many <PARA> loyal fans who have season after season shown up to support their teams only to once again be disappointed : at some point in the exercise , the desire to finally give up on the bums and stay home begins to make itself felt . this is the quintessential tale of disappointed fans finding a way to express their feelings — their teams are so bad that not only can ’ t tickets to their games be given away , but the attempt to do so will only spark others who are equally as disappointed to fling theirs away too . <PARA> the second example above is an escalation of the basic legend : in that version of the tale , an anonymous disgruntled fan actually smashes in a car window so as to gain access to the seemingly rejected item for the purpose of leaving more tickets with it . <PARA> oddly , at times this legend is manifested in non - sports versions too , as in the following example from 2011 : <PARA> the drought of 1988 brought hard times to ranchers . the lack of water meant that feed was harder to come by — and it got worse when farmers decided they ’ d better reserve what water they could spare for human food rather than livestock feed . <PARA> the natural reaction was to sell some of their cattle — it ’ s not good for the long run , but you have fewer cattle to feed and working capital to buy it with . the problem is that every rancher got this idea , and soon there was a glut on the market . it was a lovely thing for the average consumer , but as the suicide legend suggests , it wasn ’ t quite so good for the ranchers . <PARA> one day , a clever rancher came up with a plan . he loaded several of his calves into a trailer , then parked it on the side of the road , with the ramp to the trailer helpfully propped up next to it . with such an easy setup , somebody was bound to steal those calves — and the insurance company would pay him what they were worth , which was considerably more than he ’ d get for them on the current market . <PARA> when he came back to check his trailer , there were two more calves in it than when he left . <PARA> the natural reaction was to sell some of their cattle — it ’ s not good for the long run , but you have fewer cattle to feed and working capital to buy it with . the problem is that every rancher got this idea , and soon there was a glut on the market . it was a lovely thing for the average consumer , but as the suicide legend suggests , it wasn ’ t quite so good for the ranchers . <PARA> one day , a clever rancher came up with a plan . he loaded several of his calves into a trailer , then parked it on the side of the road , with the ramp to the trailer helpfully propped up next to it . with such an easy setup , somebody was bound to steal those calves — and the insurance company would pay him what they were worth , which was considerably more than he ’ d get for them on the current market . <PARA> when he came back to check his trailer , there were two more calves in it than when he left . <PARA> while the “ left tickets ” story is usually told as a “ this happened to someone else ” yarn , every now and then a beleaguered fan who has for too long backed a dog will tell it as having happened to him . an atlanta falcons ’ fan regaled the audience of a call - in radio show in 1999 with his account of having once left four falcons tickets under his car ’ s windshield wiper and coming back to find “ eight or 12 more .” in 1998 , another caller to a talk radio show said he ’ d once left two st . louis rams tickets he didn ’ t need under his wiper blades , and when he got back after the game , five unused tickets had been added to the pile . <PARA> barbara “ fan clubbed ” mikkelson
true	president donald trump ’ s nomination of brett kavanaugh to serve on the u . s . supreme court prompted a fierce , largely partisan battle that reached a fever pitch in september 2018 when two women accused the u . s . court of appeals judge of having engaged in sexual assault and misconduct while he was in high school and university . <PARA> kavanaugh denied the allegations , but the controversy dominated political debate in the u . s . for weeks and threatened to derail the u . s . senate ’ s confirmation of kavanaugh as a supreme court justice . <PARA> some supporters of president trump and his nomination of kavanaugh attempted to discredit the women and their associates , and the intense scrutiny associated with the saga meant that some who expressed opposition to kavanaugh ’ s nomination faced a backlash of their own . <PARA> that was the case for democratic senator richard blumenthal of connecticut , who told msnbc on 17 september that proceeding with kavanaugh ’ s nomination would “ forever stain the supreme court ”: <PARA> in response , a viral facebook post termed blumenthal himself a “ stain on the senate ” and maintained that he “ lied about serving in vietnam ”: <PARA> during his successful 2010 u . s . senate campaign , blumenthal said that he had “ misspoken ” about his military service during the vietnam war after the new york times obtained his selective service record , which showed he received five separate draft deferments while a college student and then , when those deferments ran out , secured a spot in the u . s . marine corps reserves ( serving stateside , not in vietnam ). <PARA> in a may 2010 investigation , the times reported that blumenthal , then connecticut ’ s attorney general , had on a handful of occasions given a misleading or inaccurate picture of his military service during the vietnam war , including stating that “ i served in vietnam ”: <PARA> after checking an archive of connecticut newspapers , we confirmed two separate statements in which blumenthal either claimed or strongly implied that he had played a role in combat operations in vietnam . <PARA> in may 2003 , the bridgeport news reported on a rally in support of american troops in iraq which had been organized by a local veterans council . during his speech at that rally , blumenthal contrasted the support shown for troops in 2003 with that shown to american military personnel returning from vietnam . “ when we returned , we saw nothing like this ,” blumenthal said , suggesting that he had personally been among those troops who served in the country of vietnam , which he was not : <PARA> in may 2007 , the milford mirror reported on that year ’ s memorial day parade in the city . blumenthal again suggested that he was among those troops subjected to abuse and harassment upon their return to the united states from vietnam : <PARA> as reported by the new york times , in march 2008 blumenthal told a group of veterans in norwalk , connecticut , that “ we have learned something important since the days that i served in vietnam ”: <PARA> however , blumenthal has also at times described his military service in more accurate and modest terms . as shown in the msnbc video above , in march 2010 ( two months before the new york times article ) the then - senate candidate directly contradicted his 2008 statement , saying that “ serving in the united states military gave me a perspective as well even in the reserves , although i did not serve in vietnam .” <PARA> in response to the 18 may 2010 times article , blumenthal arranged a press conference for the following day , during which he admitted that he had “ misspoken ” in the past when describing his military service : <PARA> in response to a question about allegations that he had misrepresented his military record , blumenthal added : <PARA> confirming the authenticity of the 2008 remarks attributed to him by the new york times , blumenthal asserted that he had intended to say “ since the days that i served during vietnam ,” rather than “ since the days that i served in vietnam ”: <PARA> blumenthal did not apologize for what he presented as his misstatements about his record . when invited to do so at the press conference , he merely repeated , “ i regret that i misspoke and i take full responsibility .” <PARA> blumenthal ’ s remarks at the may 2010 press conference can be viewed below : <PARA> it is true that blumenthal has made a handful of recorded statements that were false or misleading about his own military service during the vietnam war and admitted as much after the publication of the new york times ‘ investigation in 2010 . however , blumenthal insisted that these falsehoods were “ totally unintentional ” and claimed that he had “ misspoken ” rather than being deliberately or knowingly untruthful . <PARA> blumenthal did not always describe his military service in false or misleading terms . at times he spoke more accurately and modestly about his time in the marine reserves , and in a 2010 campaign speech ( given before the new york times report was published ), he stipulated that “ i did not serve in vietnam .”

mixture	in march 2018 , a number of memes appeared on social media to express the notion that the state of indiana had just passed a law requiring that “ every time a woman seeks medical or psychological treatment she must be quizzed about past abortions ,” with the failure to disclose such information being punishable by jail time and fines : <PARA> the most common interpretation attached to such memes was that women would face jail time for their failure to disclose previous abortions in health care settings . however , the actual news underlying this claim reported that health care providers ( not patients ) would be subject to potential legal sanctions under the law if they did not attempt to elicit and report information about previous abortion complications from their patients : <PARA> senate enrolled act 340 was authored by indiana state senator travis holdman in january 2018 ; it was signed into law by gov . eric holcomb on 25 march 2018 . that bill amended existing law to require that health care providers “ report to the state department each case in which [ they ] treated a patient suffering from an abortion complication ,” and to require that reports of abortion complications ( including psychological or emotional complications , depression , suicidal ideation , anxiety , and sleeping disorders ) contain information such as the age and race of the patient , the type of abortion procedure used , and where that procedure was performed . the bill says that each failure to report an abortion complication as required is a misdemeanor . <PARA> in other words , the law posits legal penalties ( including jail time and fines ) for health care providers who fail to report information about patients with abortion complications , not for patients who fail to disclose such information to their doctors . critics of the bill maintained that it was an attempt to discourage abortions by making the procedure appear “ dangerous ” and required the gathering of “ inappropriate ” information about patients :
false	on 24 august 2015 , former united states attorney general michael mukasey appeared on msnbc ’ s morning joe program and opined that democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton should be disqualified from holding that office due to her use of a private e - mail server for conducting government business while she was serving as secretary of state . mukasey cited u . s . code title 18 , section 2071 as basis of his statement : <PARA> during that initial appearance , he said that clinton ’ s wiping of data from her private e - mail server was the offense that violated the cited section of the u . s . code and disqualified her from office : <PARA> it is true that u . s . code title 18 , section 2071 establishes the concealment or destruction of some government records as a crime , and that public officeholders who violate the code are to be disqualified from “ holding any office under the united states ”: <PARA> however , when legal experts analyzed mukasey ’ s claim and his application of title 18 to hillary clinton , they concluded it was not legally sound , and within a week even mukasey agreed that his initial statement was problematic . <PARA> eugene volokh , a professor at the university of california , los angeles school of law ( and a legal analyst for the washington post ) ended an august 2015 column on the controversy by opining that disqualifying a person from holding the office of president over a criminal sentence was possibly unconstitutional , and that the issue was moot in clinton ’ s case because even if she were found guilty of such an offense , she would be effectively disqualified from office in the court of public opinion rather than in a court of law : <PARA> volokh largely deferred to an assessment by former rutgers law school prof . seth barrett tillman , who countered mukasey ’ s initial statement by expanding on the “ unconstitutional ” aspect raised by volokh : <PARA> in short , tillman ( and volokh ) held that the qualifications stipulated in the constitution regarding eligibility for the office of president ( i . e ., having reached the age of 35 and having lived in the united states for 14 years ) cannot be modified by congress through the passage of laws , only by amending the constitution itself . <PARA> prior to the august 2015 controversy , prof . matthew franck had expressed much the same viewpoint in the national review ‘ s “ bench memos ” column . addressing a prior version of the claim made in march 2015 by fox news anchor megyn kelly , franck maintained that a statute such as section 2071 did not have the judicial weight to override the constitution and create additional disqualifying criteria : <PARA> mukasey himself eventually concurred with tillman and others that his original comment regarding title 18 , section 2071 with respect to hillary clinton ’ s eligibility was off the mark . volokh appended his column with the following excerpt from a e - mail sent to him by mukasey :
false	origins : as sports card collectors began assembling sets from packs of 2008 topps baseball cards released in february of that year , quite a few of them were puzzled by the first entry in topps ’ “ future stars ” subset : a picture of one kazuo (“ the uzi ”) uzuki , described on the back of his card as a 16 - year - old japanese pitching prospect with an astonishing 104 mph fastball who was poised to make the jump straight from graduating high school to pitching in the ( north american ) major leagues : <PARA> already being called “ the uzi ” by some for his 104 mph fastball , kaz will be the first japan - based high - schooler to jump straight to professional baseball in america when he graduates in 2009 . “ he is , hands down , the best pitching prospect i ’ ve seen in 30 years ,” said one mlb scout . and one unnamed american league gm said , “ the contract this kid is going to get will be astronomical .” at age fourteen , he was the youngest player invited to the wbc squad trials and — although he was cut on the last day — he made a lasting impression with his 17 ks in 7 innings of work during intrasquad matches . <PARA> what caused many collectors to be skeptical of this budding future star was not just the improbability of his talent , but the fact that seemingly nobody in america — not even the most ardent of baseball fans — had ever heard of him . even if kazuo uzuki hadn ’ t yet attracted the attention of the mainstream press in the united states , surely at least a few specialty sports publications would have mentioned him , if not run features on him . yet the lack of any available information on uzuki prompted inquiries such as the following letter from a confused reader which was published in sports collectors digest ( scd ) in april 2008 : <PARA> i am a longtime subscriber to scd , and i look forward to reading all the different columns . i am writing to you because i have been frustrated by topps and <PARA> [ price guide publisher ] beckett in regard to the kazuo uzuki future star card topps put into the new boxes . <PARA> if you are not familiar , the card states he is 16 years old and throws 104 mph . i have contacted topps twice by phone and keep getting referred back to someone else . beckett has the card listed in their online guide at $ 6 , but after writing to them several times asking about the legitimacy of the card , there has been no response . <PARA> how can topps get away with this ? i am asking if you can contact them and , maybe with your clout , can get an answer . i have been on both message boards , and no one has any answers — yet there are plenty of inquiries . <PARA> [ price guide publisher ] beckett in regard to the kazuo uzuki future star card topps put into the new boxes . <PARA> if you are not familiar , the card states he is 16 years old and throws 104 mph . i have contacted topps twice by phone and keep getting referred back to someone else . beckett has the card listed in their online guide at $ 6 , but after writing to them several times asking about the legitimacy of the card , there has been no response . <PARA> how can topps get away with this ? i am asking if you can contact them and , maybe with your clout , can get an answer . i have been on both message boards , and no one has any answers — yet there are plenty of inquiries . <PARA> on the symbolically significant date of 1 april 2008 , topps ‘ fessed up and admitted that kazuo uzuki was fictitious and that the phenom ’ s bogus card was a hoax “ intended to celebrate the opening of the baseball season .” the young man pictured on the future star card was actually a 25 - year - old , non - baseball playing nyu law student named sensen lin , who told the wall street journal ‘ s law blog that : <PARA> i have a friend at topps who called me up a few months ago and asked if i wanted to do this . at first i was a little wary . i thought they were going to ask me to take my shirt off or something and that it ’ d be a practical joke . but my friend told me they ’ d pay for the cab over there to their offices and that they ’ d pay me $ 500 . so i figured why not . <PARA> they put me in all these funky poses . i don ’ t know that much about baseball so i didn ’ t exactly know what i was doing . turns out , the guys at topps added some things . i wasn ’ t wearing that necklace and the glove in the picture is different . they also photoshopped in the background . <PARA> they put me in all these funky poses . i don ’ t know that much about baseball so i didn ’ t exactly know what i was doing . turns out , the guys at topps added some things . i wasn ’ t wearing that necklace and the glove in the picture is different . they also photoshopped in the background . <PARA> as most press accounts of topps ’ hoax noted , one of the many giveaways to the gag was that kazuo uzuki means “ the first son of april ” in japanese .

false	examples : <PARA> origins : beginning on monday , the 10th of february , 2003 , we began receiving what would turn out to be a steady trickle of e - mails warning about upcoming terrorist attacks slated to take place sometime during that week or during the valentine ’ s weekend . each came from different people , and each were worded different ways , yet the underlying message was surprisingly congruent . many of the warnings mentioned someone having gleaned definitive information about the nature and location of the threat from another person highly placed in government or with one of the security forces . many listed specific details , such as new york subways having been targeted for a bioterrorism attack , or the terrorists having smuggled into the country three radioactive bombs , or that a smart bomb had been hidden in gotham by a now - unfindable man . although in some instances no specific city would be named , or ones other than new york ( such as . houston ) would get the nod , the new york city area was mentioned time and <PARA> again . <PARA> we don ’ t know what to make of all this . yes , all the chatter we ’ d been registering could be nothing more than a reaction to the raising of the national threat assessment on friday , february 7 , 2003 from yellow ( elevated ) to orange ( high ). rumor flourishes during times of unrest , especially when people are nervous about conditions in their world , and doubly so when they sense they and their loved ones are in the line of fire of actual danger . we pass along intelligences in the form of frightening stories we ’ ve heard in an effort both to reclaim a lost sense of mastery over events now spinning out of our control and as a way of giving voice to our growing sense of dread . scuttlebutt of this nature both works to make us feel a bit less helpless through the act of sharing tidbits of information that might prove useful in protecting ourselves from harm (“ stay out of the subways ” advice , in other words ) and functions as a catharsis , a way of articulating the deep sense of disquiet being experienced and through that voicing hopefully beginning to come to terms with what ’ s actually there . <PARA> in such an environment , as one person ’ s rumor washes onto the next fellow and is just as quickly passed on yet again , it soon becomes impossible to distinguish baseless fear - driven whisper from valid information harvested from those truly in the know . at a time when the u . s . shivered on the brink of a war with iraq and the wake of yet another osama bin laden tape , fear of impending terrorist acts ran high . moreover , the government assured us there was credible reason to harbor that sense of foreboding at that time . but does all that translate to information about specific threats being known to those in government and the protective agencies and us only hearing about the dangers because one or two of the people in on the secret had been quietly telling their friends ? <PARA> such attacks did not materialize . <PARA> barbara “ war of the whirled ” mikkelson

mixture	an eye - catching billboard in the state of minnesota caused some controversy in the early days of january 2018 . purportedly sponsored by “ republicans for honesty in government ,” the billboard showed a photograph of president donald trump accompanied by the words “ big mistake .” <PARA> we received several inquiries from readers about the authenticity of the billboard , and whether it was actually produced by republicans . <PARA> the billboard is real , as is another similar one found elsewhere in minnesota . however , the group behind it —” republicans for honesty in government ”— is run by a democratic donor and businessman in the state , suggesting there is more to the campaign than meets the eye . <PARA> on 2 january 2018 , the left - wing facebook page occupy democrats posted a photo of the billboard , along with a message emphasizing the apparent party affiliation of its sponsors : <PARA> that post was shared almost 25 , 000 times within three days . <PARA> the photo appears to have originally been posted to facebook in october 2017 by rosemary rocco , who said the billboard was located along u . s . route 52 , in the state ’ s second congressional district , which includes parts of minneapolis - st . paul and wabasha county . she wrote : <PARA> earlier in october , a reddit user posted another photograph of a billboard bearing a photograph of trump along with the word “ clueless .” it was also purported to have been erected by the same group . <PARA> according to records held by the minnesota secretary state , republicans for honesty in government was first registered as a non - profit corporation in minnesota in 2006 , as reported by the regional news web site bluestem prairie . its registered agent is robert johnson , founder and director of the minnesota real estate investment firm aei capital . <PARA> republicans for honesty in government shares its address with that of aei capital . the group was dissolved in 2009 , but was reinstated in march 2017 . <PARA> however , despite being the man behind a non - profit organization that labels itself republican , johnson is a prolific donor to democratic candidates and the minnesota branch of the democratic - farmer - labor party ( dfl ). <PARA> federal election commission records show that a “ robert p . johnson ,” “ robert johnson ” or “ bob johnson ” at “ aei fund management ” or related company names in minnesota has donated a total of $ 43 , 830 . 50 in federal campaign funding since 2004 . all of it went to dfl and democratic candidates or political action committees . <PARA> johnson told the minnesota news web site gomn that he had leaned towards the republican party in the past , but switched allegiances after what the web site described as a shift to the right within the gop . <PARA> federal election commission records show that in 1980 , johnson did donate $ 500 to the minnesota independent - republican finance committee , his only non - democratic federal election donation . <PARA> however , johnson registered “ republicans for honesty in government ” in 2006 , two years after he began donating exclusively to democratic and dfl candidates , including $ 7 , 000 to former democratic presidential candidate john kerry , and more than $ 10 , 000 to the minnesota dfl party . <PARA> we asked johnson questions about his involvement with republicans for honesty in government , his party affiliation , his political donations , and the purpose of the billboards . we did not receive a response . <PARA> he told gomn that the billboards were intended to provoke minnesotans to think more carefully about their electoral choices —” to maybe rub their chin metaphorically a little bit and wonder , what kind of decisions are we making ?”

false	origins : march 2004 saw the latest iteration of a form of conspiracy theory that attempts to tie automated systems related to financial transactions to the “ mark of the beast ” prophesied in chapter 13 of the new testament ’ s book of revelation : <PARA> [ the beast ] causes all , both small and great , rich and poor , free and slave , to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads . <PARA> and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast , or the number of his name . <PARA> here is wisdom . let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast , for it is the number of a man : his number is 666 . <PARA> and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast , or the number of his name . <PARA> here is wisdom . let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast , for it is the number of a man : his number is 666 . <PARA> in earlier days conspiratorial rumors linked this bit of scripture to the advent of bar codes on product packaging ; now a much - circulated 18 - slide powerpoint presentation earnestly tries to associate it with mondex , a brand of “ smart card ” technology , by misleadingly equating smart cards with implantable identification technology . <PARA> our conspiracy train has already jumped the track by the third slide , which conflates two distinctly different types of technology . <PARA> the device pictured above is a radio frequency identification ( rfid ) chip ( also known as an “ id chip ”), used ( among other purposes ) to assist retailers with automatic identification and data capture ( aidc ). described as “ bar codes on steroids ,” tiny rfid chips can be embedded in products ( or their packaging ); when triggered by sensors , these chips emit short bursts of identifying data streamed via radio waves ( or “ rf ”). this system offers a significant improvement over the current bar coding system for a number of reasons , including : <PARA> other uses for rfid chips have included implanting them in pets to help identify the owners should the animals become lost ( a collar and tag can too easily come loose or be removed ), or implanting them in humans to encode vital information that emergency medical personnel might need to know when treating a patient who is unconscious or unable to speak . <PARA> ( technically , a biochip is a computer chip made from organic molecules rather than from silicon or germanium . the term “ biochip ” is also used more generally to refer to any type of chip implanted in living beings , but rfid is only one of many technologies that might be used in such a chip . kevin warwick , a professor of cybernetics at reading university , made news in 2000 when he had a silicon chip transponder surgically implanted in his arm .) <PARA> the concept described in the text accompanying this photo , however , describes a different type of technology : the smart card . <PARA> almost every credit card issued nowadays includes a magnetic stripe which encodes information about the card that can be read when the card is swiped through an electronic card reader . ( in most cases the information encoded is merely a repetition of the account number and expiration date embossed on the card , allowing the card to be more easily read by electronic scanning devices .) the smart card technology takes that concept further by replacing the magnetic stripe with a tiny microprocessor embedded in the card . the microprocessor can store information that might be used for a variety of purposes , such as identifying that the bearer of the card is its authorized user , providing basic personal data ( e . g ., name , address , phone number ) to free consumers from the necessity of filling out repetitious forms , or providing important background information about a patient to medical personnel . ( smart cards also have the advantage of being “ contact - less ” — they can transmit data by rf instead of having to be physically swiped through readers .) <PARA> another envisioned use for smart cards is in electronic payment schemes . rather than carrying around currency and coins , consumers could use smart cards that would be able to tap into centralized systems which keep track of how much each person has available to spend . the purchase price would be automatically deducted from the buyer ’ s account at the point of sale , conceivably eliminating the need for money altogether someday . <PARA> here the text goes even further astray in an erroneous attempt to tie smart card technology to specifics of the biblical prophecy found in revelation 13 : 16 and 13 : 17 : <PARA> [ the beast ] also forced everyone , small and great , rich and poor , free and slave , to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead , so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark , which is the name of the beast or the number of his name . <PARA> first of all , smart card technology involves microprocessors embedded in cards , not people . secondly , the uses of biochips in humans and other animals for identification purposes do not involve implanting such chips in the head or the hands . the preferred location for such chips is an out - of - the - way fleshy area that will allow for tissue to bond the chip and lessen the possibility of any irritation or discomfort to the host , making the head and hands ( too bony and exposed ) non - ideal for such purposes . the recommended implantation location for biochips is between the shoulderblades , towards the back of the upper arm ( or on the back between the front legs of a dog or cat ). <PARA> the statements included in the last slide above are all misleading or inaccurate : <PARA> mastercard did acquire a 51 % stake in london - based mondex international in 1996 , and they have been trying to establish a variety of mondex - based applications in a number of countries in recent years . however , attempts to launch the use of mondex smart cards as “ electronic purse ” alternatives to cash over the past decade have so far been disappointingly unsuccessful , as this october 2003 news account of a mondex test launch in the uk illustrates : <PARA> a number of electronic payment schemes have been launched in the past decade but many have languished because they have not found resonance with consumers . the mondex card was launched in the uk in 1995 by a consortium of banks and bt , the telecommunications group . it looks like a credit card and contains a chip that can be “ loaded ” with cash from a bank account . it was seen as as ideal for small purchases such as newspapers and rounds of drinks in pubs . it was introduced in swindon in 1994 and then on university campuses at exeter , edinburgh and nottingham . but in spite of trials in about 20 countries , mondex has hardly got beyond the test stage . <PARA> again , mondex is a smart card technology , not a biochip technology . mondex has nothing to do with implanting chips into people , nor are biochips inserted into heads or hands . this bugaboo about heads and hands is just a silly attempt to tie this mondex screed to the mention of “ foreheads ” and “ right hand ” found in the portion of revelation 13 quoted above . <PARA> once again , mondex is not a biochip technology — it is a brand of smart card technology ( which uses chips produced by other companies ), and the mondex card itself was introduced at least ten years ago . neither mastercard nor mondex has reported problems with smart card fraud or announced plans to insert smart card chips into human beings rather than place them within cards because otherwise the “ chip could be cut and the information would be changed or falsified .” ( extracting an implanted chip from a human being isn ’ t really prohibitively more difficult than removing one from a plastic card , certainly not enough to absolutely prevent dedicated criminals from pulling it off .) <PARA> now we ’ ve zoomed into the area of the nonsensical . even if we were to contemplate implanting the chips utilized in “ smart card ” technology into human beings , locating them in the head or the right hand wouldn ’ t make them any more difficult or impossible to remove than locating them elsewhere in the body . ( again , this is a rather silly attempt to tie “ mondex ” to the prophecy of revelation 13 .) current rfid chip technology does not use lithium - based batteries , nor does it encompass tracking via a global positioning system ( gps ).

( by longstanding convention , even presidential vacation travel is categorized as “ official business ” for accounting purposes , since it is assumed , the congressional research service tells us , that the president is always on duty .) <PARA> in that vein , an internet meme loosed on social media nine months into donald trump ’ s presidency made the claim that taxpayer expenditures on vacations , golf , and personal security for the president , first lady melania trump , and their youngest son barron had thus far averaged more than $ 16 million per month , as compared to an average of about $ 1 million per month for travel by president obama and immediate family during obama ’ s entire eight years in office . <PARA> this is the text : <PARA> if accurate , the comparison is all the more striking in that trump was an inveterate critic of president obama ’ s travel and vacation expenses for years : <PARA> “ i would rarely leave the white house because there ’ s so much work to be done ,” trump told the hill in 2015 . “ i would not be a president who took vacations . i would not be a president that takes time off .” while campaigning for the presidency in 2016 , trump said to the american people : “ i ’ m going to be working for you . i ’ m not going to have time to go play golf .” <PARA> in point of fact , according to a report in usa today , trump only spent five of his first 26 weekends as president holed up exclusively in the white house . the rest entailed trips to his nearby golf clubs . in early august 2017 , cbs news white house correspondent mark knoller toted up how many days trump had spent away from the white house versus the number of days obama spent offsite and found that trump ’ s total , at all or part of 41 days away from washington , was nearly twice obama ’ s , at all or part of 21 days away ( although george w . bush had them both beat at 61 days away ). <PARA> although it ’ s too soon as of october 2017 , just nine months into his presidency , to render even a semi - complete portrait of the trump family ’ s travel expenses ( such details are rarely released except in response to freedom of information act inquiries , and sometimes not even then ), preliminary indications are that trump ’ s past criticisms of obama will come back to haunt him . <PARA> looking at the information we do have , the obama family ’ s travel expenses during the entire eight years of his presidency totaled approximately $ 106 million , according to the most recent foia numbers released by the conservative watchdog group judicial watch , who kept close tabs on obama ’ s spending . the obamas ’ travel expenses therefore averaged about $ 1 . 1 million per month over the course of his term . <PARA> turning to trump , the alleged $ 147 million already spent on travel by the president and his family during his first nine months in office wildly exceeds anything supported by actual data . that having been said , it does appear , based on the information available , that trump and family have indeed likely outstripped the obamas in terms of monthly travel costs , albeit by a smaller margin than claimed . <PARA> judicial watch , who have vowed to monitor trump ’ s travel expenses as closely as they did obama ’ s ( foia requests are already on file ), reported in july 2017 that two months into trump ’ s presidency taxpayers were already on the hook for $ 3 . 58 million in charges for air travel alone ( i . e ., excluding auxiliary costs such as secret service housing , local transporation , police protection , etc .) by the president , first lady , and vice president during february and march . that ’ s roughly $ 1 . 8 million per month , $ 700 , 000 more than the obamas ’ monthly average , which included the auxiliary costs we don ’ t yet have for trump . <PARA> focusing just on trump ’ s mar - a - lago trips , of which there were seven between inauguration day and mid - august 2017 , an attempt at a more comprehensive estimate by the progressive watchdog group center for american progress action fund settled on a cost of roughly $ 3 million per trip — a total of $ 21 million for all of trump ’ s mar - a - lago stays through august , amounting to $ 2 . 6 million per month ). the reliability of that estimate has been rightly called into question , given that it was generalized from a government accountability office report written well before trump took office , but it is indicative of how high the trump family ’ s travel costs — when they are updated to include actual secret service expenses and incidentals might well go . <PARA> for that matter , obligatory secret service protection extends to all of trump ’ s children , including his two adult sons , whose security costs while traveling are borne by american taxpayers even though they don ’ t work for the administration , instead running their father ’ s international business holdings . according to cbs news , lodging and transportation costs for federal agents protecting eric and donald trump jr . on their travels had already surpassed $ 190 , 000 by the end of president trump ’ s third month in office . <PARA> also indicative is a usa today report that in addition to his mar - a - lago residencies , as of 21 august trump had racked up five visits to his private golf club in new jersey . at these two locations , the secret service spent $ 60 , 000 on rent for the golf carts needed to protect the president . if that pattern continues , american taxpayers can expect to be dinged for as much as $ 103 , 000 per year in golf cart rentals alone . <PARA> although there isn ’ t yet enough information to work up a detailed comparison of the trump family ’ s travel expenses versus the obama family ’ s , it seems a near certainty , barring a dramatic change in lifestyle , that the trumps ’ expenses will continue to outpace the obamas ’ by a healthy margin , although nowhere approaching the $ 15 million - a - month disparity alleged by internet sources .
false	in march 2016 , a photo purportedly showing a promo for a new netflix original series called home improvementer started circulating online . the image , however , is not a real promo from netflix , but a parody of a recent string of nostalgia - fueled reboots , in particular the new full house reboot , fuller house : <PARA> while netflix hasn ’ t announced any plans to make home improvementer , this fake ad does feature a real photo of the original home improvement cast , which was taken in 2011 for a special “ reunion ” feature in entertainment weekly : <PARA> the 1990s - era sitcom was hugely popular , and speculation and rumors have swirled about a possible reboot of the show for some time . however , there are currently no official plans to start up the show again .
mixture	in the wake of the mass shooting at a black lives matter protest in dallas that resulted in the deaths of five police officers , several web sites published or referenced a video of a delivered by civil rights activist al sharpton at kean college in 1992 . for instance , the proud conservative web site reported that sharpton was screaming “ kill cops ” in the video , and the web site yes i ’ m right asserted that sharpton “ didn ’ t know the camera was on ” during his speech : <PARA> this is real video footage taken in 1992 at kean college in new jersey , but while it does capture sharpton using language such as “ offing cops ” and “ crackers ,” it doesn ’ t show him screaming “ kill cops ” or calling on blacks to go out and commit acts of violence . <PARA> this same video has been circulating for decades and was famously used in an anti - al gore ad during the 2000 presidential election campaign . it gained even wider prominence in 2016 when it was featured on the fox news show watters ’ world which featured a full minute of sharpton ’ s speech but used selective captioning to highlight sharpton ’ s alleged hateful rhetoric . <PARA> a transcript of the portion of the speech in question provides more context to sharpton ’ s remarks : <PARA> it ’ s clear from the wording that sharpton was mocking those who made bold declarations but didn ’ t follow through on them , and laughter from the audience also indicated they understood sharpton to be poking fun at those who called for violence while not condoning it himself . <PARA> sharpton did not call on “ blacks to kill cops ,” but he did use inflammatory language such as “ pigs ” and “ crackers ” and insinuated that those who threatened violence but didn ’ t have the gumption to follow through were deserving of derision from those who made other promises and lived up to them . <PARA> fox news correspondent jesse watters confronted sharpton about the video in april 2016 , and sharpton reiterated that his intent was to mock those who called for violence , not to exhort them to kill police : <PARA> although this 24 - year - old video was widely shared after five police officers were killed in dallas in july 2016 , sharpton has denounced those recent attacks on police officers :
false	in late march 2019 , a photograph supposedly showing piles of “ worthless ” currency thrown into gutters in venezuela circulated on social media , attached to comments blaming socialism for the phenomenon behind the striking visual . one popular posting on facebook was captioned , “ this is a street in venezuela . that ’ s money in the gutter . it ’ s worthless . welcome to socialism .”: <PARA> this is a genuine photograph of worthless money dumped in the gutter of a venezuelan street . however , the accompanying caption presents an oversimplification of the series of events that led to this currency ’ s worthlessness and its discarding by venezuelan residents . <PARA> the economic collapse in venezuela that began in 2013 is a complex matter which can ’ t be attributed to any single factor . news outlets such as bloomberg , the new york times , and fox news have cited a wide range of issues that led to the country ’ s current economic crisis , including plunging oil prices , government corruption , political unrest , and socialist policies . that brew of unfavorable economic conditions has spawned massive hyperinflation which has greatly devalued venezuela ’ s currency , as the washington post reported in january 2018 : <PARA> although hyperinflation has indeed caused the bolivar to become all but worthless , the caption on this viral photograph is a bit misleading . the money shown lying in the gutter in this picture is venezuela ’ s old currency , the bolívar fuerte , which was replaced by a new form of currency , the bolivar soberano , in august 2018 . when the bolivar soberano was introduced , bolívar fuerte currency in amounts less than 1 , 000 ceased to be legal tender , and bolivar fuerte currency in all amounts was completely withdrawn on 5 december 2018 . hence the discarded money seen here was literally worthless not because it had no value , because it had been completely replaced by a newer currency and was no longer legal tender . <PARA> here ’ s an excerpt from a cnn report about the switch in currencies : <PARA> the viral photograph was likely taken on 11 march 2019 and showed the aftermath of looting at a bank in the town of merida . local news outlet maduradas . com compiled several other photographs of the incident and reported that the perpetrators had discarded the old money on the streets and even lit some of it on fire ( translated via google ): <PARA> venezuelan journalists and social media users shared several other photographs of the scene : <PARA> in short , the “ money in gutters ” image shown above captured an older and now invalid form of currency that was tossed aside after the looting of a bank , and not usable currency discarded by citizens because it had been made next to worthless due to “ socialism .”

true	some of the most memorable scenes in white wilderness , disney ’ s 1958 academy award - winning “ true - life adventure ” nature documentary about wildlife in the snowy northern portions of the north american continent , were ones featuring the death of lemmings who drowned after jumping off cliffs and into the sea . but the scenes shown in the documentary were staged by filmmakers in order to replicate supposed real - life behavior of lemmings that could not be captured on film , and thus did disney perpetuate for generations to come the legend of periodic , inexplicable mass suicides by lemmings who die by hurling themselves off of cliffs . <PARA> the narration in the film accompanying the lemmings scenes begins as follows : <PARA> what the audience then sees is what appears to be a horde of lemmings entering the arctic sea by jumping off cliffs and scampering across rock - covered beaches to enter the water from the shore , whereupon they swim out to sea and ( we ’ re told by the narrator ) eventually drown — not quite because they ’ re simply committing suicide , the film states , but because they ’ ve supposedly mistaken the vast expanse of the arctic sea for a lake and assumed there ’ s a reachable shore just across the water . <PARA> none of what was shown in the film was realistic lemming behavior , however . disney ’ s white wilderness was filmed the canadian province of alberta , which is not a native habitat for lemmings and is landlocked with no outlet to the sea . the filmmakers had to import lemmings to alberta for use in the documentary ( reportedly by purchasing them from inuit children who had caught them in other provinces ); through the use of carefully controlled camera angles and tight editing , the filmmakers made no more than a few dozen lemmings look like a much larger number , placing them on turntables to create a frenzied migration effect and then herding them off a cliff and into the water ( which was actually the bow river , not an arctic sea ). <PARA> nine different photographers spent three years shooting and assembling footage for the various segments that comprise white wilderness , and it is not known whether walt disney approved or was aware of the activities of james r . simon , the principal photographer for the lemmings sequence . certainly nature documentaries are notoriously difficult to film as wild animals are not terribly cooperative , and many nature shows and films of this era ( including disney ’ s “ true - life adventure ” movies and the wild kingdom television series ) staged events to capture exciting footage for their audiences . nonetheless , in this case what was depicted on screen was a complete fabrication , not a recreation of real animal behavior that filmmakers were unable to capture on film . <PARA> lemmings do not periodically hurl themselves off cliffs and into the sea . cyclical explosions in population do occasionally induce lemmings to attempt to migrate to areas of lesser population density , and when such migrations occur , some lemmings do die by falling over cliffs or drowning in lakes or rivers . these deaths are neither acts of “ suicide ” nor the result of compulsive unreasoning behavior , however ; they ’ re accidental deaths resulting from lemmings ’ venturing into unfamiliar territories and being crowded and pushed over dangerous ledges or venturing into the water in a quest to reach new territory . <PARA> as the alaska department of fish and game noted in an article about this myth :
true	origins : as far as we know , the photograph displayed above , showing president george w . bush engaged in a rugby match during his days as a yale undergraduate , came to public attention when it accompanied an editorial ( entitled “ he ’ s got the bad - boy vote sewed up ”) penned by yale political science lecturer jim sleeper and published in the 9 august 2004 edition of the los angeles times . <PARA> the introduction to mr . sleeper ’ s piece presents the photograph as real : <PARA> i am looking at a photo of the george w . bush you ’ ve probably never seen before . it ’ s a sports - action close - up of him at yale , over a caption written by a fellow undergraduate more than 30 years ago : “ george bush delivers illegal , but gratifying right hook to opposing ball carrier .” <PARA> george w . bush did indeed play rugby during his undergraduate days at yale ( 1964 - 68 ). mr . sleeper didn ’ t mention the source of the picture in his editorial , but it evidently came from his 1969 yale yearbook ( which partly explains why the photo hadn ’ t been publicized earlier : george w . bush graduated in 1968 , so one wouldn ’ t expect to find any pictures of him in the 1969 yearbook ). <PARA> however , there is also another version of the photo with a different caption : <PARA> we don ’ t know for sure which of these captions is genuine and which might have been the product of digital manipulation . the use of the term “ thursday ’ s contest ” in the second photo ’ s caption implies the picture was taken from a school newspaper , so it ’ s possible the same photo might also have been used in a yearbook with a different caption and thus both are genuine . <PARA> we should point out that even though the picture is described as capturing george w . bush as “ delivering a punch to the face ” of an opponent , sports - action photos can make a perfectly ordinary portion of an athletic competition look extraordinarily embarrassing or violent — a play that appears routine in a video clip can look quite different when presented in the context of a single - image still photo . ( for example , a defender attempting a high tackle can easily appear as if he were trying to punch his opponent in the face , or the aftermath of a play can leave competitors in unusual positions . the caption might best be regarded as a tongue - in - cheek one .
false	versions of a “ walmart cash back scam ” warning have been circulating since late 2004 , all of them featuring the scenario of a walmart customer who uses a credit / debit card that is charged for a cash back amount even though the shopper did not request cash back and was handed no cash by the cashier , with the discrepancy being noticed only when the shopper spots the added cash back amount on the receipt : <PARA> in concept , this item was similar to an earlier piece which spread the false claim that gas stations were imposing surreptitious $ 10 . 00 surcharges on credit card customers . the similarity is that in both cases , it appears that an erroneous “ scam ” rumor originated because a customer misunderstood or misinterpreted something that happened to her while shopping and , despite not having any evidence of a deliberate attempt to defraud , was quick to write and circulate a message erroneously accusing retailers of wrongdoing . <PARA> we investigated a number of different walmart stores in different areas ( along with outlets of other general merchandising and grocery store chains ), and we spoke with ( both in person and via e - mail ) numerous people who were currently working as cashiers for a number of different retailers , including walmart . in not one single case did we find a store with a checkout system that allowed cashiers to initiate cash back transactions on customers ’ cards on their own , without any involvement , knowledge , or approval on the customer ’ s part . there was simply no way for a cashier working at any of these businesses to surreptitiously place a cash back charge on a customer ’ s card and furtively pocket the money , all without the customer ’ s requesting or knowing about it . as various walmart cashiers told us : <PARA> in every case of customers ’ complaining about getting cash back from credit / debit card purchases without having requested it that we were able to track down , the cause turned out to be that those customers didn ’ t pay close enough attention to the prompts on the card processing keypads or simply pressed the wrong keys by mistake . and in nearly every one of those cases it was verifiable that the complaining customers had in fact been handed the appropriate amount of cash back by their cashiers ( even though they insisted they hadn ’ t requested it ). <PARA> it is possible ( and sometimes occurs ) that a cashier will actually reach over and manipulate the customer keypad herself to initiate a cash back request unbeknownst to the customer , but this form of theft requires that the customer ’ s attention be completely diverted elsewhere , and it can ’ t be done surreptitiously — the action takes place in full view of other employees , customer , and security cameras ( and hence such perpetrators are easily caught ).
true	origins : the television and film industries learned long ago that mentioning a phone number in a tv program or movie would prompt a plethora of crank - calling kids to <PARA> dial the number in pursuit of some silly amusement , so they restricted themselves to employing numbers beginning with the mostly unused 555 prefix to avoid putting innocent parties on the receiving end of those prank calls . ( these days the 555 prefix is used for real numbers , but the 555 - 0100 to 555 - 0199 range is still reserved for the use of hollywood productions .) unfortunately , tommy tutone weren ’ t so accommodating , and their 1982 hit song “ jenny ( 867 - 5309 )” unleashed a torrent of phone calls to that number ( in all area codes ) from pranksters inquiring after the elusive jenny . although the flood of calls has abated in the two decades since the notorious “ jenny ” song topped the charts , a steady stream of crank callers still plague those unfortunate enough to have 867 - 5309 as their phone number . <PARA> the same phenomenon reared its annoying head again in 2004 , thanks to r & b artist alicia keys and her hit single “ diary .” the popular track , from the songstress ’ diary of alicia keys cd , included a lyric imploring the listener to give her a call at a specific phone number : <PARA> i feel such a connection <PARA> even when you far away <PARA> ooooh baby , if there ’ s anything that you fear <PARA> come forth and call 489 - 4608 , and i ’ ll be here <PARA> according to keys ’ publicist , lois najarian , the number given actually was keys ’ old phone number in new york , and callers who used the correct area code ( 347 ) got to listen to a recorded message from keys ( which sounded remarkably like a real person answering the phone ) and were invited to leave one for her : <PARA> hello ? ... co , wassup ? word . ( laughs .) nah , i ’ m jus ’ playing — i ’ m jus ’ playin ’. i always wanted to do that , but i ’ m not available to take your call right now , and although i can ’ t always call back , i do appreciate the love . so , leave me a good message , all right ? and take care of yourself . one . <PARA> predictably , however , fans tried to reach alicia by calling the given number in a variety of other area codes , resulting in a puzzling stream of calls to unsuspecting <PARA> residents who had never heard of alicia keys and knew nothing about the song “ diary .” according to the statesboro herald , a mr . <PARA> j . d . turner of statesboro , georgia , who was unlucky enough to hold the 489 - 4608 number in the 912 area code , was receiving 20 to <PARA> 25 calls a day , at all hours of the day , from fans looking for alicia . the beleaguered mr . turner reportedly racked up a $ 95 phone bill trying to track down the prank callers through the * 69 return call option ( until he found out his phone company charged 95 cents for each * 69 usage ), and was understandably reluctant to change a phone number he ’ d held for 14 years . <PARA> no doubt other parties around north america found themselves having to contend with similar circumstances .
mixture	if we had to come up with a list of “ e - mail truisms ,” one of the entries would probably something along the lines of : “ no list of funny headlines , humorous quips , witty observations , or the like will survive more than five forwardings in its original state .” it may sometimes take more than five forwardings , but “ list creep ” inevitably seem to works its way into such mailings , with recipients along the chain eventually dropping off some previous entries , adding new ones , and modifying others . <PARA> the “ 16 things it took me over 50 + years to learn ” list attributed to humorist dave barry is a case in point . it originated back in 1997 as dave barry ’ s “ 25 things i have learned in 50 years ” and has since been pared down to a reordered list of 16 items ( some of which were not part of the original , and some of which have been modified ) <PARA> the mutated version has circulated so widely that it is noted in the faq on dave barry ’ s web site : <PARA> for the record , entries # 1 , # 7 , # 15 , and # 16 included in the version displayed in the “ example ” block above were not part of the “ 25 things i have learned in 50 years ” piece as it appeared in dave barry turns 50 , and ( contrary to the wording of entry # 8 ) barry described gossip as being the “ most powerful ” ( not the “ most destructive ”) force in the universe . <PARA> the full text of the original piece has been reproduced on a number of web sites .
false	images of vintage print advertisements are often met with skepticism , as they frequently embody messaging that doesn ’ t sync up with modern modern social beliefs and viewpoints . this quality has made such ads a favorite template for the digital image editing crowd , who have found humor in swapping out one product for another in decades - old promotional material , making it all the more difficult for viewers to determine whether a given image is real or fake . <PARA> a magazine spread promoting guns for the entire family , for instance , is real . but a pictorial touting the benefits of consuming full sticks of butter ? nope , that ’ s fake . <PARA> so what about an advertisement that seemingly promotes selling beer to children ? a purported image of a vintage heineken ad featuring a depiction a baby drinking from a bottle of beer was posted to twitter by the “ history lovers club ” account in may 2018 : <PARA> thankfully , this is not a genuine old heineken ad . <PARA> this piece of artwork was a digital manipulation created for a photoshop contest hosted by the web site worth1000 ( now part of design crowd . <PARA> the version of the image seen above was cropped to remove worth1000 ’ s watermark ( the remnants of which can still be glimpsed in the bottom - left hand corner ), but we did find an uncropped version which clearly shows the worth1000 . com logo : <PARA> a reverse image search traced this fake advertisement to worth1000 ’ s 10th “ vintage ad ” contest in 2011 , which instructed contestants to “ take modern products and display them in a vintage light through advertisements .” <PARA> although modern audiences would find the prospect of advertising beer for babies to be unimaginable , the original ad on which the heineken spoof was based would probably be met with nearly as much dismay : a 1950s - era magazine spread for 7 - up soda , created to appeal to young consumers . <PARA> the following images come from the september 1955 and november 1956 issues of life magazine : <PARA> yes , 7 - up was truly advertised as a healthy product for babies in the 1950s . the copy for the image on the left even suggested that mothers mix the soda with milk for a “ wholesome combination ”:

false	in january 2019 , jacob wohl — a twitter political troll and veteran of a failed smear campaign against robert mueller — dipped his toes into the topic of constitutional law , asserting his view that 2020 democratic presidential candidate senator kamala harris of california was constitutionally ineligible to hold the office of president of the united states : <PARA> the constitutional requirements for the office of u . s . president are few . as stated in article ii section 1 of the u . s . constitution , they encompass only citizenship , residency , and age : <PARA> the term “ natural born citizen ” is not defined in the constitution , but “ natural born ” was a term commonly used in the english colonies during the time the founding fathers were crafting the constitution . like the u . s . constitution itself , the term has roots in english common law , and in cases when constitutional terms are undefined , english common law is generally cited to clarify them — as explained in a 2011 congressional research service ( crs ) report : <PARA> the requirements for president are therefore simple and have nothing to do with the naturalization status of one ’ s parents : <PARA> kamala harris was born in oakland , california , on 20 october 1964 , making her at least 35 years old and unambiguously a natural - born united states citizen . any child born on u . s . soil is a citizen of the united states from birth , regardless of the naturalization status of the child ’ s parents , and regardless of jacob wohl ’ s perplexing assertion to the contrary . though harris spent her high school years in canada , she has been resident in the united states since her time as an undergraduate at howard university that began in 1982 , and she has served in public office in the u . s . continuously since the 1990s . <PARA> jacob wohl is no stranger to invective targeting foreigners , and he seemingly attempted to portray harris ’ high school years in canada as some sort of nefarious evidence of ( perhaps ironically ) foreign influence in american politics . “ is it too much to ask to have a president that was born and raised in america ?” wohl implored his audience . <PARA> kamala harris , the daughter of a stanford professor father and breast cancer researcher mother , describes herself as having been raised “ in berkeley and in oakland and in montreal .” her parents divorced when she was seven years old , after which she lived with her mother , shayamala harris , whose work took her to positions with the jewish general hospital and the mcgill university department of medicine , both of which are located in montreal , in the canadian province of quebec . <PARA> regardless , kamala harris has resided in the united states since she left montreal for howard university in 1982 . she has been a united states citizen her entire life , and she is constitutionally eligible to run for president .

unproven	on jan . 31 , 2020 , the former secretary of state of missouri jason kander shared a purported heartwarming anecdote about kansas city chiefs quarterback patrick mahomes . according to kander , mahomes once picked up the tab for an entire restaurant because the patrons of that establishment didn ’ t bother him for an autograph while he ate his meal : <PARA> here ’ s the full text of the story : <PARA> we have some questions about the veracity of this story . <PARA> the anecdote has all the hallmarks of a chain email . for starters , it comes from a source with no first - hand knowledge of the incident . rather , it ’ s a story that has been passed from one person to the next . second , there are almost no specific details offered . this incident happened on an unknown date at an unnamed location . it ’ s almost as if you could swap in any celebrity for mahomes . <PARA> in fact , back in 2009 a similar story was circulated about pittsburgh steelers ’ safety troy polamalu . <PARA> a 2009 post on bleacher report reads : <PARA> the author of that post noted that they weren ’ t sure “ whether or not the story is true ,” but that “ troy polamalu is one of nicest , most feared players in the nfl .”
false	on 31 january 2015 , entertainment web site empirenews . net published an article reporting that the body of a homeless man discovered in san diego had been found through dna testing to be that of singer elvis presley : <PARA> soon afterwards links and excerpts referencing this article were being circulated via social media , with many of those who encountered the item mistaking it for a genuine news article . however , the report was just a spoof of the ubiquitous “ elvis is alive ” and “ elvis faked his death ” rumors that have circulated ever since the singer passed away in august 1977 , accompanied by an artificial rendering of what an elderly elvis might look like . <PARA> the spoof was published by the empire news , a site that issues nothing but fictional stories with titles such as “ cure for cancer discovered ; ‘ amazingly simple ’ says researcher ,” and “ college student excused from classes after dog eats grandmother ,” and “ woman gives birth , confuses doctors by asking for maternity test .” <PARA> the site ’ s disclaimer notes that “ empire news is intended for entertainment purposes only .”
false	on 21 july 2017 , the junk news website your news wire ( now news punch ) published a story reporting that linkin park singer chester bennington , who passed away on 20 july 2017 in his palos verdes estates home near los angeles , had been murdered in similar fashion to his friend , soundgarden singer chris cornell , who died two months earlier . <PARA> both bennington ’ s and cornell ’ s deaths have been ruled suicides by hanging by los angeles county and wayne county medical examiners , respectively . cornell died on 18 may 2017 in his hotel room after a concert in detroit , while bennington passed away at his palos verdes estates home on 20 july 2017 . the two men were friends — in fact , bennington took his life on what would have been cornell ’ s 53rd birthday . but rumors that their deaths were connected in any nefarious way are based on speculation and not evidence , and your news wire ’ s headline thus falsely proclaims “ police : chester bennington was murdered .” <PARA> citing a “ police source ,” your news wire asserted that authorities were investigating bennington ’ s death as a homicide : <PARA> it ’ s unclear what “ detectives ” your news wire could possibly have obtained such a quote from . palos verdes estates police have not commented on the case and have instead referred all inquiries to the coroner ’ s office . the police department for that small coastal community south of los angeles contracts with the much larger los angeles county sheriff ’ s department to handle homicides , and the sheriff ’ s homicide bureau told us they did not respond to bennington ’ s death . the quote doesn ’ t appear in any other news report about the incident . <PARA> we have spoken to all the agencies that have jurisdiction over bennington ’ s home and can confirm that , contrary to what your news wire reported , law enforcement has not said bennington was murdered . <PARA> the celebrity status of both men means relevant details about their deaths are publicly available . cornell ’ s autopsy report has been uploaded online , and in that report , wayne county assistant medical examiner dr . theodore brown notes that cornell ’ s bodyguard discovered him in the bathroom of his detroit hotel room with an exercise band around his neck . ligature marks were found around cornell ’ s neck , and the cause of death was determined to be suicide by hanging . <PARA> the los angeles county coroners told us the official cause of bennington ’ s death was also a suicide by hanging and that an autopsy report would be forthcoming at the end of july 2017 . <PARA> your news wire also quoted randy cody , a person they described as an “ investigator ”: <PARA> cody may be an amateur sleuth , but he is not a law enforcement investigator . he is a blogger who runs the metal den web site , where he occupies himself coming up with various theories to prove cornell was murdered . he was interviewed for a detroit news story about theories surrounding the singer ’ s death by fans unsatisfied with the suicide ruling , which is where your news wire lifted this information from . <PARA> a piece of supposed evidence cited by cody is a head wound he believes he saw in a youtube video of cornell ’ s last performance at detroit ’ s fox theater on 17 may 2017 and an unverified recording of radio traffic in which a medic claimed to have seen a wound on the head of an unnamed victim . no mention was made of a head wound in the autopsy report , prompting accusations that the information was “ suppressed .” however in the image from the concert it appears the “ wound ” is simply red stage light reflecting off the singer ’ s skin . <PARA> in a 22 may 2017 post , cody claimed cornell was murdered because he was about to expose pedophiles involved in pizzagate , a debunked conspiracy theory holding that a child sex trafficking ring linked to hillary clinton was being run out of comet ping pong , a washington , d . c ., pizzeria . no evidence was offered linking bennington to the non - existent pizzagate conspiracy other than a circumstantial reference to a revelation he made in a rock magazine interview that he had been molested when he was a child . pizzagate has been debunked by none other than conspiracy theorist alex jones , who was one of the key figures in originally spreading it . jones apologized and retracted the claim after a man intent on “ rescuing ” children went to the pizzeria with a rifle in december 2016 and opened fire inside . <PARA> your news wire is not a reliable source of information — they regularly post inaccurate articles and unfounded conspiracy theories . there is no evidence that bennington or cornell were murdered in an effort to cover up a debunked pedophile sex ring .
true	on the evening of 14 november 2011 , the nfl ’ s green bay packers hosted the minnesota vikings in a football match - up held at lambeau field in green bay which was televised by espn as part of that network ’ s monday night football schedule . as the previous friday ( 11 november ) had been veterans day , the packers announced they would be staging a number of veterans day - themed events before the game and during halftime : <PARA> some of those activities , such as the pre - game card stunts in which the stadium crowd spelled out messages including “ thank you veterans ” and “ thank you military ” and the unfurling of a large flag on the field during the playing of the national anthem , were captured in the photographs displayed above and audience videos such as the following : <PARA> within days of the game , reports ( such as the following account from milwaukee television station wtmj ) began to trickle out expressing disappointment that only spectators present at the game had been able to view the pre - game veterans day tribute activities at lambeau field , as espn did not include them in their telecast : <PARA> we contacted espn to invite them to explain the circumstances behind why the tribute had not been aired , and they sent us the following response : <PARA> this theme was played upon in a satirical 31 january 2012 daily spoof article which posited that the performance of the u . s . national anthem before the upcoming super bowl xlvi game would be pre - empted on television by a commercial for dodge trucks : <PARA> some readers who encountered this article out of its original context took it seriously , but as noted in the article ’ s disclaimer , “ the story above is a satire or parody . it is entirely fictitious .” <PARA> one photograph typically included with this item was not taken on the date of the veteran ’ s day - themed events at lambeau field , but rather during the season - opening game two months earlier :
false	on feb . 8 , 2020 , a well - shared twitter thread claimed that “ data ” showed a massive increase in sulfur emissions over wuhan , china . the thread further suggested that a likely explanation for this alleged observation was the cremation of bodies associated with the outbreak of the new coronavirus whose origin is in that region : <PARA> the sun and the express , among other outlets , uncritically repeated this claim , despite its dubious origins . both outlets later deleted their stories without a correction note by the time of our reporting . the sun , for example , had described the above image as showing the “ extent of corpse burning in wuhan .” that premise is fatally flawed for at least two reasons . <PARA> first and most significantly : the data presented are not a real - time observation of sulfur concentrations above wuhan . instead , the image is a computer - model output designed to predict , based on a historical knowledge of the area and its current atmospheric conditions , what concentration of sulfur is likely present in the air at a given time and place . second , sulfur is not a significant emission from human cremation . it is , however , a significant emission from the burning of coal in power plants or for other industrial uses like iron and steel production . the area directly below the hotspot shown in twitter thread is , in fact , the wuhan iron & steel company . <PARA> the source of the data highlighted in the twitter thread is a company named windy . com , which combines several models and meteorological inputs to create global maps of weather conditions aimed primarily at people who partake in outdoor sports . windy , in turn , gets its sulfur data from a nasa climate model named geos - 5 . arlindo da silva , a research meteorologist at nasa ’ s global modeling and assimilation office , told the british fact - checking organization full fact that the geos - 5 sulphur dioxide models do not “ assimilate real satellite data ” into their forecasts . <PARA> instead , he said , “ our forecasts are based on fixed emission inventories ,” which “ do not account for the day - to - day variations in so2 emissions and as such cannot account for sudden changes in human activity .” the sulfur fluctuations present in the geos - 5 model stem from “ variations in the meteorological conditions , in particular winds .” the high levels of industry in the region — the wuhan iron & steel company — are likely the cause of higher “ emission inventories ” prescribed by the model for the wuhan region . <PARA> the viral twitter thread asserts that “ sulfur dioxide [ is ] commonly associated with the burning of organic matters .” this is a technically correct statement that is grossly misleading in this context . sulfur dioxide is commonly associated with the burning of coal . coal , formed from the carbon compounds of dead plant material buried and heated naturally in the earth for millions to hundreds of millions of years , is indeed an example of “ organic matter ” that , when burned , can release sulfur dioxide . <PARA> humans , while also an example of organic matter , nevertheless contain a negligible amount of sulfur . carbon , hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen , calcium , and phosphorus make up more than 99 % of all chemicals in the human body , leaving less than 1 percent for anything else , including sulfur . the sulfur present in coal dominantly comes from geologic processes that occur over millions of years . as such , a recently deceased body , when burned , is not going to generate an abundance of sulfur compounds even if there were live satellite measurements to document that release of chemicals ( which there are not ). <PARA> none of this is to say that there has not been an increase in cremation in areas in china affected by the spread of the coronavirus . on feb . 2 , 2020 , the chinese government announced that it was banning all funerals for victims of the viral infection , further stipulating that cremation would be required for their bodies . <PARA> however , the suggestion that satellite data provides a measurable signal of increases in cremation relies on two fundamental misunderstandings about both the atmospheric model at issue and the chemistry used to interpret it . as such , we rate this claim as “ false .”
false	examples : [ collected via e - mail , april 2009 ] <PARA> you know the swine flu is going around and obama has had his 100 days in office right ? well i heard a saying that says “ in 100 years ( the 100 days obamas in office ) the first black man will be president , pigs will fly ( the swine flu ).” <PARA> for years people have said that there wouldn ’ t be a black president until pigs could fly . obama ’ s been in office for 100 days and wouldn ’ t you know it ; swine flu ! <PARA> origins : times of crisis prompt people to search for meaning as they struggle to come to terms with frightening events well beyond their power to control , or even influence . we hunt for portents to see if scary current events might have been foretold , <PARA> because if they had , we can at least draw some measure of comfort from a sense of history unfolding as preordained . <PARA> president barack obama , the united states of america ’ s first black president , realized his first hundred days in office on 29 april 2009 . since the time of president franklin d . roosevelt ’ s sweeping new deal reforms in 1933 , the “ 100 days ” benchmark has become a standard for gauging presidential effectiveness . those first hundred days of a new presidency are carefully scrutinized for signs of actual achievement of promises made on the campaign trail and for indications of how well the new officeholder handles the responsibilities that come with the highest job in the land . one might think of it as an informal interim report card issued by the american people on their chief executive . <PARA> while there is nothing inherently magical about that 100 - day period , some of more superstitious bent also look to the events that take place within it . which brings us back to the ‘ prophecy .’ <PARA> just at the tail end of those hundred days , news of a novel strain of swine flu broke . while it is still too soon to tell how virulent this incursion of h1n1 might be , or how widespread the contagion will become , the world health organization and many nations ( including the u . s .) are taking seriously the potential for a pandemic that could cost a great many lives . <PARA> many did not feel the u . s . was ready to elect an african - american to its highest office . such disbelief could well have been couched in a variety of colloquial terms , including “ it ’ ll happen when pigs fly .” <PARA> and yet , the u . s . did elect a black president . also , while porkers did not actually take to the skies within his first hundred days in office , one could say that ‘ swine flew ,’ especially if a bit of license were taken with the spelling of the second word . <PARA> prophecies sometimes employ such trickery , using one spelling of a word where another is intended , thereby leaving the meaning of the augury unclear until the unfolding of the events they supposedly pertain to . <PARA> the writings of one particularly famous seer are replete with this sort of doubletalk . the french physician and astrologer nostradamus ( 1503 - 1566 ) penned numerous quatrains populated by obscure imagery that continue to prove a bafflement to scholars that attempt unravel his <PARA> meaning . it is therefore no surprise that someone would attempt to lay ‘ pigs fly / swine flu ’ prediction at his feet . however , nostradamus made no claims about <PARA> u . s . presidents ( black or otherwise ) in his writings , nor did he predict the flying of pigs . his is but a name that is invoked whenever a story requires the insertion of a famous seer ( e . g ., an april 2008 satire piece titled “ nostradamus obama prophecies revealed ,” a february 2003 hoax about the disaster that took the lives of those aboard the space shuttle columbia , a september 2001 hoax regarding the foretelling of the september 11 attacks on america , and the 2000 howler that the u . s . presidential election of that year would be won by ‘ the village idiot ‘). <PARA> if not nostradamus , then who ? well , no one . that a well recognized idiom expressing disbelief (‘ when pigs fly ’) might have been applied to the election of a black president doesn ’ t mean anyone actually made such a prediction , or that any utterance of that common saying in relation to such event had been meant as prognostication . no venerable psychic or seer intoned such a prophecy . while the word play (‘ swine flew ’ versus ‘ swine flu ’) is cute , it is coincidental , not the result of a fortune teller ’ s having foreseen a looming pandemic . <PARA> barbara “ days of swine and roses ” mikkelson
mixture	in late 2017 , a number of memes circulated on facebook advising iphone users of a purported new function allowing them to discreetly contact emergency services by pressing the lock button five times and selecting emergency sos : <PARA> readers asked : <PARA> this option is available to users of iphones running the operating system ios 11 . an apple support page explaining the details and limitations of the feature began : <PARA> the feature is accessible by different methods , depending on the iphone model and geographic location of the user : <PARA> because the feature depends ios 11 , users of iphone models older than 5s cannot access it . <PARA> users with newer iphones must upgrade to ios 11 in order to access the feature ; they should read apple ’ s documentation and test whether they can access the emergency sos option before trying to use it in an emergency . the service may depend on the reliability of local emergency services . <PARA> travelers should also inform themselves about how to manually access emergency services in whatever location they are visiting , as it is entirely possible that they might not have access to their phone in an emergency . <PARA> skepticism about the claim wasn ’ t unwarranted . a similar rumor held that asking siri ( iphone ’ s voice assistant ) to “ charge my phone to 100 percent ” would trigger a police response , but that was mostly false . rumors about ways to surreptitiously contact emergency services long predate the use of smart phones . another false rumor purported that leaving a phone off the hook would eventually trigger a 911 call . the danger of these rumors is that they give potential crime victims a false sense of security , and could distract from other ( real ) ways to get help in an emergency .

mixture	on 18 september 2017 , facebook user mike abreu posted what he presented as a photograph of a restaurant check receipt from his recent visit to a cheesecake factory outlet in valencia , california , that appeared to offer some misleading and exaggerated tip amount suggestions : <PARA> the credit card receipt is authentic . abreu ( who goes by “ frank ”) brandished an identical - looking slip during an interview with los angeles television station kcal , along with an itemized receipt showing the same total cost ($ 33 . 76 including sales tax ) but accurate tip suggestions ( 20 % of the bill as $ 6 . 75 , for example ). the <PARA> date and server ’ s name on that receipt were both the same as the credit card slip featured in abreu ’ s facebook post . <PARA> a spokesperson for the cheesecake factory told us that the discrepancy was caused by an error resulting from a staff member ’ s mistakenly processing the abreus ’ order along with someone else ’ s , yielding a larger total that was then used as the basis for the tip suggestions presented in each check : <PARA> it would appear that the staff member corrected the error in the itemized receipt , leaving accurate tip suggestions there , but processed the credit card payment as if it were part of the erroneous “ split bill ,” creating the inaccurate tip suggestions there . ( if the combined cost of the two bills were $ 73 . 55 , for example , then $ 14 . 71 would have been an accurate suggested amount for a 20 % tip .) <PARA> the practice of presenting tip suggestions based a whole table ’ s order , in each separate receipt after a bill is split , is controversial . the cheesecake factory is currently being sued in los angeles superior court for allegedly presenting tip suggestions misleadingly based on percentages of a whole table ’ s bill , in instances where diners split checks : <PARA> the case has the potential to become a class action lawsuit . an initial status conference is scheduled for 18 october 2017 .
false	no matter how many times conspiracy theories are disproved , they never die . <PARA> witness the return of a decades - old canard holding that vince foster , a longtime friend and associate of bill and hillary clinton , did not commit suicide in 1993 ( contrary to the findings of multiple investigations ), but instead was murdered by the clintons “ because he knew too much .” <PARA> since the mid - 1990s , foster ’ s name has held a place of prominence on the viral list of “ clinton body bags ,” a constantly growing roster of clinton contacts who supposedly died under “ mysterious circumstances .” like the theory that foster didn ’ t really kill himself , the rest of the “ body bags ” list has been discredited time and time again . <PARA> the vince foster theory persists because it has a partisan fan base . while campaigning for the presidency , donald trump lent it credence during a 2016 interview in which he called the circumstances of foster ’ s death “ very fishy ,” the washington post reported : <PARA> the rumor cropped up in september 2018 in the form of a meme shared by two hyperpartisan facebook pages , uncle sam ’ s misguided children and cold dead hands : <PARA> the timing was curious . “ on this date in 1993 ,” the meme says , “ vince foster went to fort marcy park and shot himself 3 times in the back of the head to avoid testifying against hillary clinton .” but foster committed suicide in july of that year , not september . after some searching , we found that the meme had been previously posted on 20 july 2018 , when that part of the claim , at least , would have been accurate . <PARA> the decision to re - share it in september 2018 ( assuming there was any thought behind it at all ) may have had to do with the fact that the senate confirmation hearings of supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh had just run into a roadblock in the form of an accusation of sexual assault by a woman who said kavanaugh groped her at a party in the 1980s . the most likely explanation for bringing up foster would seem to be that it was meant to divert attention from a trump - related scandal to a clinton - related scandal , but there ’ s a complication : kavanaugh led the investigation of vince foster ’ s death by independent counsel kenneth starr in the mid - 1990s , an investigation that confirmed ( ironically , in this context ) foster ’ s death was indeed a suicide . <PARA> kavanaugh has been condemned , on the one hand , for reopening an investigation that had already been concluded by a previous independent counsel , robert fiske , and “ tormenting ” foster ’ s family ( in the words of liberal pundit paul begala ) on the basis of rumors that the clintons were somehow involved in his death . but kavanaugh ’ s involvement has also given rise to a strange new addendum to the conspiracy theory in far - right circles , namely that in exonerating the clintons he helped cover up wrongdoing on their part . <PARA> right - wing pundit andrew napolitano gave voice to this accusation during a fox news channel appearance : <PARA> whatever the motivation behind its re - sharing , the meme got almost everything wrong . what ’ s true is that foster killed himself in 1993 ( although it was in july , not september ), and that he did so in fort marcy park in virginia ( not , contrary to napolitano ’ s claim , in the white house ). <PARA> but the sarcastic claim that he “ shot himself three times in the back of the head ” ( implying that it wasn ’ t really a suicide ) is a fabrication . every investigation to date has found that he shot himself once , in the mouth , with his own handgun . the implication that his death was connected to an expectation of his giving testimony against the clintons is equally false . foster , who was a white house deputy counsel at the time , was distraught over accusations of malfeasance involving the white house travel office , and he had sought treatment for depression prior to his suicide . foster consistently maintained that the travel office scandal was baseless . <PARA> as the washington post ‘ s glenn kessler wrote :

here ’ s a marine ’ s answer : “ america is not at war , the us marines are at war ; america is at the mall .” let ’ s be clear on this : obama did not kill bin laden . an american sailor , who obama , just a few weeks before , was debating on whether or not to pay , did ! in fact , if you remember a little less than two years ago , his administration actually charged and attempted to court - martial three navy seals from seal team six , when a terrorist suspect they captured , complained they had punched him during the take - down and bloodied his nose . obama ’ s administration further commented how brutal they were . the left were calling them nazi ’ s and baby killers . now all of a sudden , the very brave men they vilified are now heroes when they make his administration look good in the eyes of the public . obama just happened to be the one in office when the cia finally found him and our sailors took him out . essentially , obama only gave an answer , yes or no , to him being taken out . this is not an obama victory , but an american victory !! <PARA> ed schreiber <PARA> col . us mc ( ret .) <PARA> ed schreiber <PARA> col . us mc ( ret .) <PARA> origins : shortly after terrorist mastermind osama bin laden was killed by a u . s . navy seal team in may 2011 , the following item began circulating , claiming to document president obama ’ s hypocrisy in approving the raid that resulted in the death of the al - qaeda leader . the piece contrasts statements supposedly made by barack obama in 2008 ( before he was elected president ) with allegedly contradictory statements made by him in 2011 ( after the killing of bin laden ). it fails in that regard , however , because all but one of the statements it attributes to barack obama were never uttered by him . <PARA> there is no record documenting that barack obama ever , publicly or privately , referred to seal team 6 as former vice - president dick “ cheney ’ s private assassination team .” and while president obama stated clearly during his 1 may 2011 announcement of bin laden ’ s death that the decision to go ahead with the operation was his , he never claimed he had “ put together ” the seal team unit that carried it out . <PARA> as noted above , president obama did state that the decision to go ahead with the navy seal raid that took out osama bin laden was his , but he never said “ bin laden is innocent until proven guilty , and must be captured alive and given a fair trial .” in fact , he said just the opposite during a 7 october 2008 debate with republican presidential candidate john mccain : <PARA> if we have osama bin laden in our sights and the pakistani government is unable or unwilling to take them out , then i think that we have to act and we will take them out . we will kill bin laden ; we will crush al qaeda . that has to be our biggest national security priority . <PARA> during the 2008 presidential campaign , barack obama promised he would close the detention facility at guantanamo , so one could therefore infer he thought the facility to be “ unnecessary .” however , he never said “ detainees should not be interrogated ,” only that he would end the use of torture as a means of interrogation : <PARA> as president , barack obama will close the detention facility at guantanamo . he will reject the military commissions act , which allowed the u . s . to circumvent geneva conventions in the handling of detainees . he will develop a fair and thorough process based on the uniform code of military justice to distinguish between those prisoners who should be prosecuted for their crimes , those who can ’ t be prosecuted but who can be held in a manner consistent with the laws of war , and those who should be released or transferred to their home countries . <PARA> military and intelligence experts agree that torture is not an effective means of interrogation , and our using it threatens american troops serving abroad . from both a moral standpoint and a practical standpoint , torture is wrong . barack obama will end the use torture without exception . he also will eliminate the practice of extreme rendition , where we outsource our torture to other countries . <PARA> military and intelligence experts agree that torture is not an effective means of interrogation , and our using it threatens american troops serving abroad . from both a moral standpoint and a practical standpoint , torture is wrong . barack obama will end the use torture without exception . he also will eliminate the practice of extreme rendition , where we outsource our torture to other countries . <PARA> although it is possible “ intelligence was obtained from guantanamo detainees that led to our locating bin laden ” ( see this abc news article for some comments on the issue ), president obama himself made no statement to that effect .

( if you ’ ve ever tasted any of the earthy , subtly spicy coffees imported from sulawesi , odds are the beans were grown and hand - harvested in tana toraja .) nor is it a coincidence that virtually every travel guide offering information about the remote location spotlights certain “ peculiar ,” “ complex ,” and purportedly “ gruesome ” funerary practices found there ( practices that are indeed so unusual and elaborate that entire books have been written about them and tourists flock to record them on their mobile devices ). the more we learned about these traditions , the more we became convinced they were the inspiration for tales about indonesia ’ s so - called “ walking dead .” <PARA> it ’ s unclear precisely how long the toraja people , who descended from austronesian speakers living in central sulawesi well before europeans arrived in the 1500s , have inhabited the island . during the 1700s , the toraja population was driven into the southern mountains ( where the majority of them are still concentrated ) by another ethnic subgroup , the buginese . although most toraja now identify as christian or muslim , many still honor beliefs and customs handed down from their ancestors — beliefs and customs in which death takes center stage . <PARA> anthropologist kelli swazey described the torajans ’ intimate , intricate relationship with the dead in a 2013 ted talk entitled “ life that doesn ’ t end with death “: <PARA> in toraja society , swazey explains , death is seen as a process — and a lengthy process , at that — rather than as a singular event : <PARA> a national geographic video shot in 2016 provides brief glimpses into tana toraja death and burial rites ( warning : includes graphic scenes of animal sacrifice ): <PARA> of particular interest with regard to the “ walking dead ” tales we ’ re investigating is the ma ’ nene ceremony , in which the mummified corpses of dead family members are exhumed , washed , reclothed , and walked through the center of town , examples can be seen both in the latter half of the national geographic video above and this tourist video uploaded to youtube in 2016 : <PARA> bringing our investigation full circle , loyola university anthropology professor kathleen adams , who spent two years in tana toraja observing the lives and culture of its people , confirmed in an interview with loyola magazine that the “ walking dead ” stories represent a corrupted version of the truth : <PARA> that ’ s not to say that concept is entirely foreign to the culture . “ torajans also tell stories about corpses that walk on their own to their final resting place ,” kelli swazey told us via e - mail : <PARA> so , folklore and media sensationalism notwithstanding , do the deceased really rise from their graves and walk in tana toraja , sulawesi ? yes , but no — not literally . they do so only with the help of surviving family members , who continue to demonstrate their love and devotion long after the physical bodies of their loved ones have gone quiet . <PARA> the photograph does not show an actual zombie .

true	origins : the petition quoted above began circulating on the internet in october 2000 . it calls upon folks to electronically sign a petition in support of the boy scouts . ( the boy scouts of america are not sponsoring this petition ; an unrelated entity is housing and administering it .) <PARA> the petition ( found at the grassfire site ) reads as follows : <PARA> petition to support the boy scouts !! <PARA> as a concerned citizen , i am deeply troubled by the recent attacks which have come against the boy scouts simply because the scouts have taken a stand for faith and moral values . as a private organization , the boy scouts has every right to set standards for leadership and morality . the u . s . supreme court made this clear ! i urge you to cease these hostile attacks against one of america ’ s great institutions . <PARA> should you sign it ? the answer to that depends on two things : what your views on the underlying issues are , as well as what you think of the validity of online petitions . <PARA> we think it ’ s not at all likely any internet petition ( no matter what issue it addresses ) will have an appreciable impact on anyone in a position to affect policy . it ’ s too easy to cook up lists of fake names and phony e - mail addresses and festoon a petition with them for anyone charged with gauging public reaction to be tempted to give such documents much weight when it comes time to make a decision . petitions signed in ink in a variety of different handwritings aren ’ t given all that much consideration in this world ; how valid will a computer printout appear ? <PARA> a decision to support this petition should probably be based on what one thinks of the recent u . s . supreme court decision to uphold the boy scouts of america ’ s right to exclude homosexuals from its ranks . the grassfire petition glosses the question of why support is being sought by saying nothing other than “ the scouts have taken a stand for faith and moral values .” this wording leaves those who weren ’ t aware of the core issue in the dark as to what prompted folks to withdraw support from the bsa . we don ’ t find that a fair way to write a petition . <PARA> in a 5 - to - 4 opinion handed down on 28 june 2000 , the supreme court decided that the boy scouts of america held the right as a private group to expel scoutmaster james dale on the basis of his sexual orientation . the court ruled : <PARA> having determined that the boy scouts is an expressive association and that the forced inclusion of dale would significantly affect its expression , we inquire whether the application of new jersey ’ s public accommodations law [ the statute contended in a new jersey suit involving dale ] to require that the boy scouts accept dale as an assistant scoutmaster runs afoul of the scouts ’ freedom of expressive association . we conclude that it does . <PARA> grassfire expresses its view of the issues at stake as : <PARA> this summer , the scouts won a hard - fought case before the u . s . supreme court called dale v . scouts . the supreme court affirmed the scouts ’ right to set standards for leadership within their organization . this apparently infuriated the politically correct cultural elites . almost immediately , the anti - scout campaign was launched , with the scouts being branded as intolerant . <PARA> the standard affirmed by the supreme court in dale vs . scouts , which recognized the bsa ’ s right to determine how to run its organization , also applies to the groups who would now withhold funding from the scouts : they too possess the right of association . some local chapters of the united way are guided by policies that expressly forbid them from financially supporting groups that practice discrimination . they have discontinued funding of the boy scouts of america because their entrenched principles <PARA> rule out this association in much the same way the bsa ’ s principles rule out an association with homosexuals . it ’ s the same issue , just the other side of the coin . <PARA> at this point , only a few chapters of the united way have withdrawn financial support from the boy scouts of america . some municipalities are also now refusing to allow scout troops to use municipal sites for camping and rallies . united way funding to the bsa has not yet been substantially affected , however . a rough estimate of loss of beneficence over this issue places the figure at $ 500 , 000 a year out of budget hundreds of times that . ( in 1996 , for example , united way funding of the bsa amounted to $ 83 , 743 , 000 .) <PARA> as to what to make of the core issue behind the petition , it comes down to this : the boy scouts uphold their deeply - held beliefs by barring homosexuals from becoming scouts or scoutmasters . that stand , however , impels organizations who have sworn to refuse aid to those who practice discrimination to now recognize the boy scouts of america as one of the groups they must turn away . <PARA> barbara “ one good turn deserves another ” mikkelson

mixture	the bombings that ripped through brussels on tuesday , 21 march 2016 , shocked belgium and sparked an outpouring of support for the dozens of victims who were killed or injured . <PARA> among those badly hurt were three american mormon missionaries , all from utah : elders richard norby , joseph empey , and mason wells . ( all are expected to recover , and a fourth , sister fanny rachel clain , was hospitalized with minor injuries .) <PARA> the name of one of the missionaries in particular — 19 - year - old mason wells — caught the attention of the media , because he had been affected by two other terror attacks as well : paris and boston . the teen ’ s third brush with terrorism prompted headlines , articles , and speculation over whether he was the luckiest or the unluckiest person in the world . <PARA> however , while wells ’ presence at all three events appears to be a terribly unlucky set of coincidences , it isn ’ t as wildly improbable as it might initially seem based on headlines (“ brussels attacks : teenager also survived boston and paris bombings ”) and articles that implied wells was in the middle of each : <PARA> on a closer reading , wells ’ proximity to each of these events was noteworthy but not as dramatic as headlines made it sound . <PARA> the 2013 boston marathon bombing killed three people , wounded at least 260 , and caused widespread panic , but the bombings were located in one small , central area . the marathon is a huge event that draws hundreds of thousands of people to the city every year ( 23 , 181 people ran in the 2013 event , including his mother , kymberly wells ). he was close to , but not in , the bombing area , as were at least 500 , 000 other spectators , each close enough to hear the explosion ( or , at least , the response to it ). <PARA> wells ’ link to the boston marathon bombings is interesting , but it is misleading to call him a survivor of the attacks rather than someone who was simply close by when they occurred . the same is true of his purported involvement in the paris bombings in november 2015 , a series of coordinated attacks which killed 130 people ( including 89 at the bataclan theater ) and injured 368 . wells was in france at the time of the attacks , but not in , or even very near , paris : <PARA> “ two hours ” away is not very specific , but it ’ s clear that whether it was a matter of dozens or hundreds of miles , wells was far enough away from the attacks that ( like the boston bombing , but unlike the brussels bombing , in which he was wounded ) he couldn ’ t be classified as a survivor , or even someone who was in the immediate vicinity at the time . rather , he was someone who was in a country at the same time that it was shaken by a series of shocking and traumatic events that occurred within a 33 - mile radius , two hours away from him ( which is about the same amount of time it takes to drive from tijuana , mexico to san bernardino , california , or from toronto , canada , to buffalo , new york ). <PARA> it ’ s human nature to seek patterns and to feel involved in an event that you were relatively near or recently visited , especially where terrorist attacks are concerned , which — thanks to the internet and round - the - clock network news coverage — feel far closer and more imminent than they might have even twenty years ago . but rather than serve as a reminder that today ’ s world is a “ dangerous and hostile place ”, as wells ’ father said , his presence near the first two attacks could also show that even the largest and most destructive terrorist attacks occur over a very limited space , and that their primary objective is to create an atmosphere of constant fear , wariness , and uncertainty . <PARA> while terrorism is undeniably frightening and unpredictable by design , the fear that these attacks create is ( also by design ) statistically far out of proportion to the death , destruction , and misery that they bring .
unproven	any occasion on which a member of the u . s . supreme court leaves the bench through retirement ( or death ) is a significant political event , providing the incumbent president with the opportunity to nominate a successor who is ideologically congruent with the party in power and ( in most cases ) will remain on the bench for decades to come . the requirement that a supreme court nominee be confirmed by a vote of the u . s . senate often touches off bitter fights between the two parties on the floor of that chamber . <PARA> when justice anthony m . kennedy announced his imminent retirement at the end of june 2018 , it set the stage for a particularly momentous shift in the makeup of the supreme court , as kennedy had long been the bridge between the court ’ s liberal and conservative sides on a number of contentious social issues : <PARA> many critics still smarting over the republicans ’ successful ( and unprecedented ) efforts at blocking approval of merrick garland , who had been nominated by outgoing president barack obama in 2016 after the death of justice antonin scalia — thus allowing incoming president donald trump the opportunity to fill the vacant court seat instead — immediately jumped on a conspiracy theory involving the timing of kennedy ’ s resignation and his son ’ s employment : <PARA> the details of this conspiracy theory were somewhat hazy , most versions of it seemingly implying that president trump somehow leveraged his financial connections with kennedy ’ s son justin to convince or coerce the jurist to retire ahead of the november 2018 u . s . mid - term elections ( during which democrats might pick up enough senate seats to block confirmation of trump ’ s preferred nominee ). <PARA> the most coherent form of the conspiracy theory posited that kennedy ’ s retirement was a sudden and unexpected event , a strategic move intended to allow trump to nominate a friendly successor who would vote favorably on any issues involving justin kennedy that might come before the court as a result of the ongoing mueller investigation into russian election interference ( whereas kennedy would have to recuse himself from such issues if he remained on the bench ): <PARA> as the new york times noted , donald trump did have a business relationship with deutsche bank , where justin kennedy once worked ( he left the company in 2009 ), that went back many years to a time when many other banks were leery of doing business with trump : <PARA> and , of course , many news outlets have reported on the potentially suspect coincidence that right about the time trump was sworn in as u . s . president , deutsche bank was fined an aggregate $ 630 million for their involvement in a $ 10 billion russian money - laundering scheme — and deutsche bank ’ s records were later reportedly subpoenaed by special prosecutor robert mueller ’ s investigation into russian interference in the 2016 u . s . elections : <PARA> little hard evidence suggests that the kennedy rumors are more than political conspiracy - driven speculation , however . justin kennedy left deutsche bank before the money laundering activity referenced above took place , and some sources have asserted that justin kennedy had little or no involvement with trump ’ s deutsche bank dealings : <PARA> the level of engagement justin kennedy might have had with donald trump ’ s financial dealings at deutsche bank remains ambiguous for now , but the new york times gave little weight to the notion that anthony kennedy was directly pressured into retiring , observing that it ’ s not unusual for presidents to be mindful of when an open seat on the supreme court bench might be in the offing and strategize around the possibility : <PARA> moreover , politico reported back in april 2017 ( before the mueller investigation into russian interference was even underway ) that the trump white house might have been utilizing connections between trump ’ s and kennedy ’ s children to ease the elder kennedy into retirement . notably , politico referenced justin kennedy ’ s having a connection with donald trump , jr ., not president trump himself , and made no mention of deutsche bank : <PARA> it may be true , as outlined above , that members of the trump administration undertook efforts to “ assure kennedy that his judicial legacy would be in good hands should he step down at the end of the court ’ s [ current ] term .” but no substantive evidence yet suggests anything more than that president trump and other members of his administration might have sought to curry favor with a justice who was already mulling retirement to influence the timing of that event .
true	in december 2018 , a photograph went viral on twitter that depicted a so - called “ mummified dinosaur ” discovered in 2011 in alberta , canada . the specimen was said to be approximately 110 million years old : <PARA> other tweets proffered different images of the same dinosaur , as well as links to articles on nationalgeographic . com and smithsonianmag . com detailing the discovery : <PARA> the photographs are real . taken at the royal tyrrell museum of paleontology in drumheller , alberta , they document a fossilized specimen of a plant - eating dinosaur from the cretaceous period , described in a june 2017 article in national geographic as follows : <PARA> nationalgeographic . com offers a 3 - dimensional , virtual tour of the nodosaur fossil , which is considered remarkable by paleontologists because it ’ s the best preserved specimen of its kind ever discovered : <PARA> when the nodosaur died , its 18 - foot - long carcass was apparently washed into an inland sea , scientists say , where it sank to the bottom and was eventually petrified inside and out by the minerals in the water and sediment covering it . the location ( no longer covered by water ) is now a mining site in what are known as the athabasca oil sands . <PARA> in media interviews , researchers participating in both the excavation and preservation of the find described the specimen as “ mummified .” one of those scientists was don brinkman , director of preservation and research at the royal tyrrell museum , who characterized it in remarks to the new york times as “ basically a dinosaur mummy .” <PARA> “ mummy ” is a word not often applied to dinosaur fossils , however , a fact that prompted confusion and debate in online discussions about the exhibit . one such conversation took place on reddit . com , where a user objected in noting that “ no , it ’ s fossilized not mummified . the difference is that the soft tissues got fossilized as well , instead of just the skeleton .” <PARA> another user replied to say : “ well , in order to get to this state it would have first become mummified and then fossilized . the reason soft tissue is so rarely preserved is because it relies on natural “ mummification ” in some sort of anoxic environment to prevent decay over the time fossilization takes .” <PARA> we reached out to some of the scientists at tyrrell for clarification on their use of the term but did not receive a response by press time . our own research suggests that the explanation above is essentially correct , however . in paleontological terms , mummification occurs when the soft tissues of a specimen are preserved under conditions that arrest the normal process of decomposition before fossilization takes place . we tend to associate mummification with extremely dry conditions , but it can also take place in moist environments inhospitable to scavengers and microbes , as paleontologist caleb brown explained in may 2017 : <PARA> a fossilized dinosaur that underwent a similar process of underwater mummification was discovered in north dakota in 2006 . it was said at the time to be one of only a handful of mummified dinosaur fossils known to exist , and that remains true today , according to brown :
unproven	a tulsa - based businessman running for governor of oklahoma was the center of controversy in may 2018 , when posts appeared on his campaign ’ s facebook page in which he appeared to call for disabled people in receipt of government benefits to be euthanized or left to “ starve and die .” <PARA> christopher barnett , who runs several small businesses in oklahoma and is running as a republican on platform of free speech and cuts to public spending , has claimed that his account was hacked and denies personally writing the posts . on 13 may 2018 , a facebook user posted a series of screenshots of posts from the “ chrisforgov ” facebook page , which has since been suspended : <PARA> in one post , barnett ’ s account posted a poll which asked : “ should a person be required to apply for 2 jobs a week if receiving food stamps and take any job offered to them to gain employment and if they refuse , they lose their food stamps ?” <PARA> in another post , someone wrote : “ the ones who are disabled and can ’ t work ... why are we required to keep them up ? sorry but euthanasia is cheaper and doesn ’ t make everyone a slave to the government .” <PARA> in a third post , written in response to another user ’ s comment ( which isn ’ t shown ) the following was posted from barnett ’ s account : <PARA> yet another post , captured by the oklahoma city television station kfor , proclaimed : <PARA> in an e - mail , barnett denied ever having written any of these posts : <PARA> christopher ’ s husband , george barnett ( also known as trey ), was an administrator of the campaign page and reportedly had his personal facebook accounts suspended as well . <PARA> in a statement posted on his campaign web site , chris barnett wrote that he had received “ thousands of death threats ” in the days after the screenshots were posted . he told us he and his husband had hired a “ 24 / 7 security detail ” to keep them safe and had placed “ armed guards ” outside their businesses as well . <PARA> in response to our questions , barnett told us he does not support involuntary euthanasia in any circumstances , but he does support assisted suicide ( due to the experience of “ watching [ his ] father die from cancer ”), and does believe governments have a duty to prevent the deaths of people who are disabled , cannot work , or cannot pay for food . <PARA> barnett also told us he had reported the alleged hacking of his account to both facebook and law enforcement . when asked which agency he reported the hacking to , he replied , “ our security team is handling that .” he also said he had reported the alleged death threats to law enforcement but again did not specify which agency . <PARA> without evidence of a hack , or proof that barnett personally wrote the statements published on his campaign page , we cannot determine what was the true source of the controversial posts . <PARA> barnett is clear about whom he suspects to be responsible for the alleged hacking of his facebook account , as well as most of the purported death threats . in an e - mail , he told us : “ this was a very well played move by someone , likely from the university of tulsa or the law firm of hall estill ...” <PARA> representatives for both the university and the law firm told us they were unable to respond to any of barnett ’ s allegations due to ongoing litigation . we asked barnett to provide proof of the death threats and evidence to support his claim that they had “ mostly ” come from the university of tulsa and the tulsa - based law firm hall estill , as well as his claim that “ democrats have promised to assassinate [ him ] if [ he ] is elected .” <PARA> barnett told us “ this is a security matter that we cannot discuss ,” but added that he hoped to be able to publish evidence of the purported threats at a later date . barnett is suing both the university of tulsa and hall estill in federal court as part of a messy , years - long legal saga which began with a production of the glass menagerie , a delayed dinner date , and — somewhat fittingly — a series of facebook posts . <PARA> ‘ christopher blackstone ’ <PARA> trey barnett was a theatre major at the university of tulsa in september 2014 , and he was a lighting designer on a production of the classic tennessee williams play the glass menagerie . on the night of 27 september , he accompanied faculty and fellow students to the on - campus theater to continue work on the production , which was scheduled to open two weeks later . <PARA> some students arrived late , however , which delayed the start of their work and ultimately caused trey barnett to be late in meeting christopher mangum ( then his fiancé ) for dinner , senior vice provost winona tanaka would later recount . ( to avoid confusion , we ’ re going to refer to christopher barnett using his maiden name for the remainder of the article , even though the couple were married in december 2014 .) <PARA> that night , mangum vented his frustration in a post on barnett ’ s facebook page , criticizing the chair of the theatre department for not taking “ better control ” of her students , denouncing one theatre professor as “ unqualified ,” and musing that “ tu really needs to fire ” her , as well as attacking a theatre student for being “ morbidly obese ” and “ giving alcohol to underage minors .” <PARA> this wasn ’ t the first time that mangum had posted scathing criticisms of the university of tulsa ’ s theatre program on social media . <PARA> in march 2014 , under the pseudonym “ christopher blackstone ,” he accused a second theatre professor of being “ corrupt ” and having an affair while she was on a theatre trip to ireland with barnett , seven other students , and mangum himself . the following month , he once again posted to his fiancé ’ s facebook page , accusing the theatre department of being “ quite careless and extremely disorganized ” in its supervision of a class project involving painting the walls of an off - campus building . <PARA> these postings came to a head in september when figures within the theatre program filed complaints against trey barnett . the following month university officials decided barnett had breached the school ’ s harassment policy by not removing his fiancé ’ s posts from his facebook page , despite repeated requests . <PARA> the university of tulsa suspended trey barnett until january 2016 , by which time the student who was the target of some of mangum ’ s attacks was expected to graduate . barnett was also barred from finishing his theatre degree , which he was close to completing , meaning that if he did return to the university in 2016 he would have to effectively start his studies from scratch with a new major . <PARA> the suspension garnered coverage from inside higher ed and drew condemnation from the foundation for individual rights in education ( fire ), who wrote : “ punishing someone for the speech of a friend or relative might be par for the course in a dictatorship , but it has no place on our nation ’ s college campuses .” <PARA> in january 2016 , barnett filed a lawsuit against the school in tulsa county district court , alleging breach of contract , a violation of his right to due process , negligence ( for allegedly failing to conduct a proper investigation ) and intentional infliction of emotional distress . he is demanding more than $ 75 , 000 in damages in a case which was still before the court as of may 2018 . the university has denied almost every factual claim made by barnett . the school is represented in that case by the law firm hall estill . <PARA> ‘ the lies of susan ’ <PARA> at the same time , the couple were engaged in a separate battle with another local educational institution — tulsa community college ( tcc ). in early 2015 , a few months after trey barnett ’ s suspension from the university of tulsa , mangum contacted tcc with a request to rent its theater for a play called “ the lies of susan ,” which barnett was going to put on . <PARA> this appears to have set off red flags among tcc and university of tulsa faculty , according to e - mails released later . the head of the university ’ s theatre department , whose complaint about barnett paved the way for his suspension , is named susan barrett . her husband , bill carter , works in the theatre department at tcc . <PARA> “ wow , now you are ‘ art ,'” a university of tulsa colleague wrote to barnett in july 2015 . in an email sent to us , mangum acknowledged that his husband ’ s former department head was “ going to be the inspiration for the main character .” <PARA> the couple never got the space , and the play was never performed , but the story did not end there . in july 2015 , mangum filed an open records request with tcc , asking for any and all email correspondence between tcc faculty member bill carter and his wife , university of tulsa professor susan barrett . <PARA> the college sent him some emails , but not all of them , withholding messages of a personal or private nature . from there , mangum ’ s requests mushroomed . <PARA> he asked the college for a copy of any contract it had with a local attorney ; consistently disputed the search fees charged to him ; and requested all emails held on tcc ’ s servers containing the words “ nigger ,” “ terrorist ,” “ queer ,” “ fag ” and “ fagot ” [ sic ], in order to “ see if discrimination and racism ” were taking place at the college . <PARA> when mangum found out that the woman in charge of records requests at tcc also worked for the city ’ s water and sewage authority , he then filed a records request with the city of tulsa , asking for all emails sent to or from her email address , later noting that they would “ answer more of [ his ] questions about the city ’ s drinking water .” <PARA> in july 2017 , two years after his first open records request , mangum sued tcc , asking tulsa county district court for a declaration that tcc ’ s policy on records requests was a violation of the oklahoma open records act , as well as an injunction ordering the college to end its allegedly narrow interpretation of the law . as of may 2018 , that case was also pending . <PARA> “ this does not make me feel safe ” <PARA> on 4 january 2018 , the lawsuit took a dramatic turn — one which would spawn yet another legal battle , provoke troubling questions about mangum ’ s behavior , and prompt a sharp escalation in his allegations against the university of tulsa and attorneys at hall estill . <PARA> that morning , mangum was taken out of court by sheriff ’ s deputies and detained for a short period , before being released and returned to the courtroom . in transcripts , oklahoma assistant attorney general jeb joseph , who is representing tcc in the open records case , explained that his office had received information about possible “ threats ” made by mangum : <PARA> we asked mangum whether this was true , or if he had ever said or done anything , even as a joke , which could have been interpreted as a threat . he responded , “ no .” we could find no record of him ever having been prosecuted for making threats or engaging in intimidation or harassment . <PARA> however , court records and e - mails sent between members of the tulsa theatre community reveal a pattern of behavior that some of mangum ’ s legal adversaries clearly found concerning . <PARA> during trey barnett ’ s litigation against the university of tulsa , mangum started a web site called universityoftulsalawsuit . com , which he promoted by sending thousands of leaflets to local residents , and even taking out billboard advertisements bearing the web site ’ s name . in september 2017 , he told local news web site tulsa world that the billboards were costing him $ 7 , 500 a month . <PARA> on the web site , mangum posted documents from the couple ’ s ongoing lawsuits , but also launched relentless personal attacks on almost everyone involved in each case . he called university of tulsa administrators and attorneys from their law firm hall estill “ nazis ” and “ racists ,” claiming they were members of the ku klux klan and “ hate gay people .” <PARA> “ i think that these people are worse than adolf hitler ,” mangum wrote of hall estill attorneys . in a series of bizarre postings , he lashed out at the appearance and even personal hygiene of his legal adversaries , calling one university of tulsa professor a “ cat lady ” whose “ house smelled of cat urine and feces ,” and labelling one attorney at hall estill “ morbidly obese ,” writing that “ the man smelled like big macs during the court hearing .” <PARA> mangum took to posting the home addresses and names of relatives of hall estill attorneys , as well as figures from the university of tulsa and tcc . he took photos of opposing attorneys from inside the courtroom and posted them online , in one instance posting a photograph of a hall estill attorney and a woman mangum identified as his wife . <PARA> he made deeply personal comments and allegations about the purported criminal history of one attorney ’ s wife and daughter . in one instance , he even posted about the death of that attorney ’ s son , writing that “ karma is a bitch ,” and “ he is dead because of you .” <PARA> in an email sent in response to our enquiries , mangum defended these postings , saying “ it shows how ridiculous it sounds to make someone responsible for something they have no control over ,” and likened this to barnett ’ s suspension from the university of tulsa over comments mangum had made . he told us he posted this type of content because he is “ defending [ himself ] against their attacks and trying to bring the truth to light .” <PARA> “ people choose to read my website and they choose to get upset because they do not like the content . i ’ ve not done anything illegal ,” he added . <PARA> mangum told us he posted various home addresses as a “ demonstration of how transparency works ,” and defended his repeated descriptions of his adversaries as “ nazis ” and “ little hitlers ,” saying : “ to take away someone ’ s rights and try to take away their livelihood because of who they are is exactly what the nazis did .” <PARA> mangum is an avowed gun lover and owns several firearms . in the midst of several bitter legal disputes , some of his public pronouncements on that subject have clearly caused concern to those he and his husband are suing . in april 2015 , while engaged in a dispute over renting theatre space from tcc , he mused on facebook about his desire to purchase an ar - 15 semi - automatic rifle , and buy a safe for all his guns . “ does that make me a terrorist or a radical or a threat to society ?” he asked , adding that he was looking for “ something powerful .” <PARA> a few months later , a university of tulsa theatre professor highlighted the facebook posts in an e - mail to department chair susan barrett , which was later disclosed under mangum ’ s open records requests . the professor said she was “ concerned ” by them , writing , “ while there was no explicit threat , this does not make me feel safe ,” and adding : “ i don ’ t think [ the university of tulsa ] will do a thing until chris comes in with that big gun and mows us all down .” <PARA> in february 2015 , the same professor asked barrett for a security guard to be assigned to the theatre building , citing her concerns about mangum . <PARA> on universityoftulsalawsuit . com , mangum later posted a photograph of himself holding an ar - 15 rifle and carrying a holstered handgun : <PARA> when asked why he had posted a photograph of himself holding firearms on a web site devoted to a lawsuit that had no connection to gun rights , mangum told us he was only using the picture “ to show who the author [ of the posts ] is ” and that others had “ put meaning behind it .” <PARA> although mangum was only briefly taken out of court for questioning by a sheriff ’ s deputy in january 2018 , he saw the episode as proof of a conspiracy between the university of tulsa , hall estill , the oklahoma attorney general ’ s office , and the tulsa county sheriff ’ s office to silence and intimidate him in the context of the ongoing litigation . the next day , he filed yet another lawsuit , this time accusing the university , the law firm , and two particular attorneys of unlawful seizure , false imprisonment , civil conspiracy and other charges relating to the january courtroom incident . <PARA> the case was sent to federal court in february , where both the university and the law firm have rejected almost every factual claim made by mangum , and argued for his suit to be thrown out . as of may 2018 , the case is still before the u . s . district court for the northern district of oklahoma . <PARA> the “ false imprisonment ” lawsuit marked a striking escalation in the couple ’ s contentious history with the university of tulsa and its law firm , hall estill . in may 2018 , those allegations reached a new peak of seriousness when mangum accused them of hacking into his gubernatorial campaign facebook page , posting inflammatory comments on his behalf , and then sending him hundreds of death threats . <PARA> the republican primary in the oklahoma gubernatorial election is scheduled for 26 june 2018 . mangum is unlikely to feature among the contenders in a ten - way race which — as of may — was led by lieutenant governor todd lamb , former oklahoma city mayor mick cornett , and businessman kevin stitt .
false	internet trolls were working overtime to discredit christine blasey ford after she accused supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh of having sexually assaulted her when they were both in high school in 1982 . while many of these false rumors focused on miscaptioned photographs , others — such as the claim that ford had similarly accused previous nominee neil gorsuch of sexual assault — were simply made up out of whole cloth . <PARA> the twitter account “ grrrgraphics ” helped spread yet another falsehood about ford by posting a meme claiming that she had lied about calling a friend on a cellphone about the attack in 1982 : <PARA> another version of this meme was posted in a thread on 4chan : <PARA> dr . christine blasey ford did not claim that she called a friend on her cellphone after brett kavanaugh allegedly attacked her in 1982 . this claim does not appear in the letter ford sent to the senate judiciary committee on 22 september 2018 , nor was it offered by her during her opening statement or in the subsequent questioning of her before the committee . <PARA> in fact , ford said that she didn ’ t tell anyone ( via cellphone or otherwise ) about what had happened in the immediate aftermath of the alleged attack : <PARA> this claim appears to be based on an attempt to read between the lines of ford ’ s testimony and not on something she actually said or claimed . in other words , it was completely fabricated . <PARA> ford said during her testimony that she ran out of the house after the alleged attack , but averred that she didn ’ t remember exactly how she got home . arizona prosecutor rachel mitchel summarized this portion of ford ’ s testimony in a memo to gop senators and noted that making arrangements for a ride in 1982 , before the widespread use of cellphones , would not have been easy : <PARA> an internet user on “ the_donald ” section of reddit also found the absence of cellphones in 1982 to be a detriment to ford ’ s account : <PARA> cellphones have certainly made mobile communication easier , but society was still able to function before their invention . ford could conceivably have used the landline in the house where the party took place , found a nearby payphone , hailed a cab , hitchhiked , or been picked up by a friend who happened to be driving by in order to get home . regardless , ford never claimed that she used a cellphone in 1982 to tell a friend what had happened or arrange for a ride after she was allegedly sexually assaulted by brett kavanaugh . <PARA> this meme contained a completely fabricated claim about ford ’ s testimony in an apparent attempt to discredit her . however , it did , for what it ’ s worth , correctly state that the retail price of a motorola dynatac 8000x in 1984 . in fact , this meme plagiarized the introductory paragraph of an article about the first handheld cellphone published by mashable back in 2014 .
false	in mid - march 2018 , social media rumors appeared that walter palmer , a trophy hunter responsible for the 2015 death of cecil the lion , was appointed by the trump administration to its wildlife conservation council : <PARA> the rumor appears to have come from misleading ( or misconstrued ) articles . for example , on 16 march 2018 , washingtonpress . com published a post with a confusing headline : <PARA> that post referenced a mother jones piece published the same day , which did not say walter palmer was on the council . the article stated that of sixteen council members , ten have an affiliation with trophy - hunting lobby group safari club international , one of whom is walter palmer : <PARA> safari club international , or sci , has an estimated 50 , 000 members . <PARA> the claim was widely misinterpreted , with many inferring from reports that the trump administration had personally appointed walter palmer to the international wildlife conservation council . formation of the group was announced on 8 november 2017 . palmer was not listed among its sixteen members .
false	examples : <PARA> if you think you ’ re having a bad day ... the following true story should help put everything in perspective . <PARA> seems a couple got a brand new , top of the line , jeep cherokee for christmas and drove it to visit relatives in michigan . the guys decided to do that male bonding ritual of duck hunting . so they load up the cherokee with decoys , food , beer , guns , warm clothes , etc . and head off for the lake . now it ’ s a little known fact that when duck hunting in cold climates like that , it ’ s common to drive the truck out onto the ice . <PARA> it ’ s also a little known fact that , to break a hole in the ice for the decoys , a stick of dynamite is commonly used . ( we are talking michigan .) now this particular stick of dynamite had a short fuse , estimated at 20 seconds or so . normally you put the dynamite on the ice , light the fuse , and run away . but with only 20 seconds they didn ’ t want to do that , they might slip while running . so the guy lights the fuse and throws the stick of dynamite out onto the ice . <PARA> next thing you know , their well - trained labrador retriever dashes out onto the ice and , just as he ’ s done several times before , picks up the stick ( of lit dynamite ) in his mouth and starts running back to the group of guys . the guys start yelling at the dog but , as he ’ s played fetch so many times before , he just keeps bringing the stick back to his master . one of the guys thinks fast and loads his shotgun , and shoots the dog . as it ’ s loaded with bird shot the dog isn ’ t hurt much , but is confused . the guy shoots the dog again . the dog gets scared and runs , stick in his mouth , under the cherokee . <PARA> the cherokee is now at the bottom of the lake . the insurance company won ’ t pay up because it was destroyed due to an illegal use of explosives . <PARA> the first payment of $ 475 was due december 15 . only 59 more to go . . . <PARA> [ collected on the internet , 2002 ] <PARA> this is from a radio program , a true report of an incident in michigan : <PARA> a guy buys a brand new lincoln navigator for $ 42 , 500 and has $ 560 monthly payments . he and a friend go duck hunting in winter , and , of course , all the lakes are frozen . these two guys go out on the lake with the guns , the dog , and , of course , the new vehicle . <PARA> they drive out onto the lake and get ready . now , they want to make some kind of a natural landing area for the ducks , something for the decoys to float on . in order to make a hole large enough to look like something a wandering duck would fly down and land on , it is going to take a little more effort than an ice hole drill . <PARA> so , out of the back of the new navigator comes a stick of dynamite with a short , 40 - second fuse . now these two rocket scientists do take into consideration that they want to place the stick of dynamite on the ice at a location far from where they are standing ( and the new navigator ), because they don ’ t want to take the risk of slipping on the ice when they run from the burning fuse and possibly go up in smoke with the resulting blast . <PARA> they light the 40 - second fuse and throw the dynamite . <PARA> remember a couple of paragraphs back when i mentioned the vehicle , the guns and the dog ? let ’ s talk about the dog : a highly trained black lab used for ... retrieving . especially things thrown by the owner . you guessed it , the dog takes off at a high rate of doggy speed on the ice and captures the stick of dynamite with the burning 40 - second fuse about the time it hits the ice . the two men yell , scream , wave their arms and wonder what to do now . the dog , cheered on , keeps coming . one of the guys grabs the shotgun and shoots the dog . the shotgun is loaded with # 8 shot , hardly big enough to stop a black lab . the dog stops for a moment , slightly confused , but continues on . another shot and this time the dog , still standing , becomes really confused and of course terrified , thinking these two geniuses have gone insane . <PARA> the dog takes off to find cover , under the brand new navigator . <PARA> boom ! <PARA> dog and navigator are blown to bits and sink to the bottom of the lake in a very large hole , leaving the two idiots standing there with this “ i can ’ t believe this happened ” look on their faces . the insurance company says that sinking a vehicle in a lake by illegal use of explosives is not covered . <PARA> he still had yet to make the first of those $ 560 a month payments !! <PARA> and you thought your day wasn ’ t going well ? <PARA> origins : the story of the incompetent hunters and their boomerang dog first made the internet rounds in <PARA> early 1997 . <PARA> as much as people want to believe this tale , it ’ s folklore and nothing more . in addition to the lack of checkable facts ( in none of the versions are the lads named ; neither is the lake where this supposedly happened , yet we know the type of truck and the amount of the monthly payments ), there are further indications this story is but a fanciful tale . <PARA> duck hunting takes place in the fall , not the dead of winter . ducks fly south for the cold months , long before there is ice thick enough to support a truck . a duck ’ s food supply is located under water — would they put off migrating until what they subsisted on was locked up in nature ’ s refrigerator and they were starving ? heck , no : unless there ’ s an unseasonably early freeze , they ’ re long gone by the time lakes are ice locked . <PARA> additionally , to put a hole in the ice , one cuts with a saw or drills with an auger . blowing a hole with dynamite would shatter the edges and cause cracks to radiate outwards , making it a foolhardy venture to attempt walking on the ice anywhere near that hole as the ice surface could give way underfoot at any moment . <PARA> next , we ’ re asked to believe that their “ well - trained labrador retriever ” is at the same time both the world ’ s greatest fetch artist and hasn ’ t mastered any one of three basic obedience commands : namely , “ drop ( it ),” “ down ,” or “ stop .” it ’ s unthinkable that a hunting dog wouldn ’ t know “ drop ” — how else do you get the prey from him once he ’ s fetched it ? <PARA> wrestle him for it , maybe ? <PARA> last but not least is the urban legend theme of the “ loaded dog ” ( or prey ) running underneath a vehicle with a lit stick of dynamite in its mouth . stories about booby - trapped animals getting revenge on the hunters who pursue them are rife ; it takes little looking around to unearth numerous examples . <PARA> in the “ prey gets even ” category , we have the tale of the coyote that had a stick of dynamite tied to its tail : he runs back and goes to ground underneath the owner ’ s brand new camper , with the expected pyrotechnic results . similarly - armed rabbits and dingoes have reputedly done in other trucks the same way . <PARA> then we have the chicken hawk a pissed - off farmer subjected to the same treatment : he perches on the roof of the man ’ s house , blowing it away . dogs with lit gasoline - soaked rags have tunneled under their tormentor ’ s homes , and lit bunnies have torched hay barns . fish who ’ ve been fed an explosive have had the piscatorial sense to swim back under the boat and make their final moments ones of vengeance , and so supposedly have sharks who ’ ve had cherry bombs tossed to them . the moral of the story is always clear : cruelty reaps its own reward . justice is served , sometimes even with a side of slaw . <PARA> in addition to the prey ’ s getting even with cruel hunters , we also have tales of hunting dogs that have been overtrained to fetch . in regards our loaded hunting dog , folklorist jan brunvand says that jack london ’ s 1902 short story “ moon - face ” may be based on this legend : <PARA> the narrator contrives to murder a man who catches a trout by tossing dynamite into a deep pool . his scheme is to give the poacher a dog that has been highly trained to retrieve ; then , when the dynamite stick is tossed out , the dog brings it back to its new master . the verdict of a coroner ’ s jury is “ death from accident while engaged in illegal fishing .” <PARA> other versions of the “ fatal retriever ” story have the man trying to get rid of excess fish by blasting them to kingdom come ; the dog dives in after the dynamite , then chases his owner with it , blowing up a chicken coop as a suitable finale . that one was told in britain in 1995 — notice how strong a resemblance it bears to the 1902 jack london tale . <PARA> another ancient example of this legend as literature is the 1899 henry lawson short story “ the loaded dog .” <PARA> loaded animal stories are told all over the world , with the avenging critter supposedly wreaking his revenge in canada , the u . s ., australia , and britain ( and probably in other countries that don ’ t keep nearly as good records of their urban folklore tales .) for a couple of related tales featuring well - dressed kangaroos and well - armed deer , visit our “ deja ‘ roo “ page . <PARA> why do we tell such nonsense stories ? it ’ s a matter of loving a good revenge tale . we cheer for the loaded bunny who blows up a brand new land rover because we ’ re all too aware the hunters shouldn ’ t be treating varmints like that in the first place . such stories satisfy our need to believe in retribution , reaffirming our trust in evil deeds not going unpunished ( and therefore good deeds being justly rewarded ). <PARA> in the case of a hunter ’ s own dog turning on him , it becomes a matter of laughing at someone ’ s stupidity . there ’ s something morally right about a fellow ’ s having to continue to make payments on a vehicle his own idiocy sent to the bottom of a lake . we laugh at him even as we reassure ourselves that we ’ d never be that stupid . <PARA> as a suitable finale to the “ duck hunters ” tale , i give you this from a 1990 newspaper . keep in mind that not everything that appears in print is necessarily true , and that the art of tongue - in - cheek writing has not yet entirely passed away : <PARA> a bunch of arkansaw stockbrokers went out in the numbing cold of last december to hunt ducks . the pond they chose was frozen over and ever prepared , they tossed a stick of dynamite onto the ice to break it , as ducks refuse to come to a frozen pond . with them was their highly trained and valuable duck dog who carried the noble name of napoleon . napoleon ’ s speciality was fetching . when the explosive was tossed , he skidded on the ice , grabbed the stick with the smoldering wick and began to return it to whence it came . the hunters went into a panic and began retreating but good old napoleon kept acoming . there was nothing to do but shoot him . just as the shot reached him the dynamite exploded and the poor dog was scattered over southern arkansaw . <PARA> reassembled and buried , his headstone reads , napoleon blown - apart . <PARA> reassembled and buried , his headstone reads , napoleon blown - apart . <PARA> barbara “ terrier - able ” mikkelson <PARA> sightings : some elements of this legend appear in the 1997 film grosse pointe blank . though the incident itself is not shown on screen , in one conversation two characters discuss an “ exploded dog ” episode . mention is made of a prized pooch who grabbed explosives meant to kill someone else and did itself in , but there ’ s nothing about its diving under the owner ’ s car or chasing after anyone with the dynamite in its mouth . <PARA> the legend plays out in tragic fashion in the british television series monarch of the glen . in the 10th episode of season three ( original air date 13 january 2002 ), useless ( hector macdonald ’ s dog ) retrieves a dynamite - laden toy boat that had been launched in an effort to kill a pike that had been laying waste to the loch and lays it at his master ’ s feet , thereby dispatching hector to the great beyond . ( unaccountably , the dog survives untouched and appears in further episodes .) <PARA> update : a january 2006 news story described events quite similar to the gist of this legend , although it didn ’ t involve hunting . a fort sumner , new mexico , man who caught a mouse inside his house tried to dispose of the rodent by tossing it into a pile of burning leaves . the mouse , with its fur ablaze , reportedly scampered out of the burning leaf pile and ran back towards the house , stopping beneath a window and catching the exterior of the structure on fire . the home and everything in it was destroyed by the resulting conflagration .
true	a popular video has puzzled countless viewers who have stumbled across it on the internet , leaving them wondering about both its genuineness and its context . what could prompt a middle - aged woman to haul off and deliver a solid punch to the face of another woman , all without causing any apparent consternation to the bystanders who witnessed the attack ? <PARA> the scene took place in 1999 outside a courtroom where a reckless driver had just been sentenced for causing an accident that left two people dead and a third severely injured . this clip was taken from ( originally unaired ) videotape shot by a news crew from station ky3 - tv in springfield , missouri , and was used in a “ newsroom ethics ” lesson prepared by the radio and television news directors foundation , who described it thusly :
false	this version of the “ help a family in need by forwarding an e - mail ” plea began its internet life in early september 2003 . once again , kind - hearted netizens were being told that by spamming their friends they could help relieve the plight of a financially - stricken family at a loss for any other method of affording vital medical care for a dangerously ill or injured child : <PARA> yet once again it ’ s a hoax . there is no comatose five - year - old victim of a hit - and - run accident , and no premature baby born with down syndrome and chronic colitis as a result of the emotional stress her mother endured . it ’ s just another leg - pull , another chapter in the “ let ’ s see how many fools we can get to spam each other ” game . <PARA> although aol is often named in these sorts of hoaxes as the benefactor standing by ready to ship monies to the desperate family on the basis of how many forwards are generated aol does not help ill children in this fashion . at least up until 2001 ( we ’ re not sure if this program is still in operation ), the internet provider did have a program wherein it recognized through its “ child of resolution ” awards in the united kingdom the achievements of children who had “ demonstrated tremendous resolve in continuing their education , in spite of chronic or recurring illness , disability , or injury ,” but said award amounted to “ an aol child of resolution 2001 certificate , a £ 100 cheque , a year ’ s sponsored membership of the aol service in the uk , and an aol rucksack containing a watch , t - shirt and stationery .” <PARA> although these gifts would certainly delight and motivate a child , they hardly amount to underwriting medical bills that run into tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars for individual youngsters . aol is invoked in these hoaxes simply because it ’ s big and it ’ s online . <PARA> hoaxes such as these rely upon the recipient ’ s believing in bits of shopworn internet fiction , such as the myth of a program for tracking e - mail through a cascade of forwards and the widespread gag involving rewards of free merchandise from any number of household - name companies . <PARA> therefore , bleed not your heart for this fictitious single mother of four and her ill - advantaged brood , nor forward “ her ” plea to others . spare your friends .

false	for decades , scientists have alleged a connection between aluminum and alzheimer ’ s disease , and whether such a link exists has been the subject of a long - standing debate within the scientific community . ( indeed , when silent film great rudolph valentino passed away from a perforated ulcer in 1926 , rumor held that his demise was caused by his consuming food prepared in aluminum cookware .) <PARA> the more specific claim about the health dangers cooking with aluminum foil often pops up in viral news stories , such as one published on clickbait site awm . com under the headline “ doctors now have warning : if you use aluminum foil , stop it or face deadly consequences ,” which made the following argument : <PARA> this claim rests on three assertions . first , that cooking with aluminum foil will liberate aluminum and be transferred to your food in a form that can be ingested ; second , that this aluminum will reach your brain in concentrations high enough to be significant ; and third , that high concentrations of aluminum in your brain put you at increased risk of alzheimer ’ s . <PARA> will cooking with aluminum foil liberate aluminum ? yes , acids typically dissolve metals , and aluminum is no exception . a 2012 study published in the international journal of electrochemical science , which is often cited in viral news stories because of its more alarmist claims about alzheimer ’ s , investigated how much aluminum was liberated through the process of cooking food in foil . not surprisingly , researchers found the amount varied depending upon factors such as temperature and acidity , but that some aluminum did , in fact , leach into food cooked in foil : <PARA> how much of that leached aluminum would stay in your body ? not much — most research on the topic agrees that it ’ s much less than 1 %. a 2011 report published in the journal neuroscience stated that “ healthy humans and laboratory rats absorb between 0 . 06 % and 0 . 4 % of ingested al ”. <PARA> could some of that ~ 0 . 4 % of leached aluminum make it to your brain ? based on studies that directly injected rats with high doses of aluminum , the answer is yes , but not much . according to the world health organization , once the aluminum does make it into your bloodstream , a very small percentage ( of an already small percentage of ingested aluminum ) actually ends up in your brain : “ approximately 60 , 25 , 10 , 3 and 1 % of the aluminium body burden is in the bone , lung , muscle , liver and brain , respectively .” <PARA> the amount of aluminum you would need to eat on a regular basis to see much of a buildup in your brain is unrealistically large . but , for the sake of argument , let ’ s say some of that leached aluminum does get into your brain . will it increase your risk factor for alzheimer ’ s ? <PARA> the debate over a connection between aluminum and alzheimer ’ s has gone on for decades , originally inspired by the observation that the brains of alzheimer ’ s patients have high concentrations of aluminum compounds and that a major symptom of the disease is the buildup of plaque that contains aluminum compounds . <PARA> at the moment the field remains mixed on the role of aluminum as a possible risk factor for alzheimer ’ s . both the alzheimer ’ s society of canada and the international alzheimer ’ s association ’ s official stance is that aluminum is not a risk factor for the disease . a 2008 cdc toxicology report describes the scientific consensus as follows : <PARA> more recent studies have come to light that may end up reinvigorating the debate , but both the connection of aluminum to alzheimer ’ s and its mechanism for causing the disease are far from settled science . that being said , it ’ s incredibly unlikely you are exposing your brain to high concentrations of aluminum by cooking with aluminum foil in the first place .
false	examples : [ collected via facebook , october 2013 ] <PARA> i heard that facebook is getting rid of its privacy policy ? if so , what about the safety of the children who are on facebook ? <PARA> origins : back in december 2012 facebook announced it would be retiring an option that allowed users to control whether they show up when others type their names into the facebook search bar . the social network began eliminating that option ( which shows up in privacy settings as “ who can look up your timeline by name ?”) from the accounts of people who weren ’ t using it , and in october 2013 facebook announced it would be completing the removal of that setting for the “ small percentage of people still using it ”: <PARA> everyone used to have a setting called “ who can look up your timeline by name ?,” which controlled whether you could be found when people typed your name into the facebook search bar . <PARA> the setting was created when facebook was a simple directory of profiles and it was very limited . for example , it didn ’ t prevent people from navigating to your timeline by clicking your name in a story in news feed , or from a mutual friend ’ s timeline . today , people can also search facebook using graph search ( for example , “ people who live in <PARA> seattle ,”) making it even more important to control the privacy of the things you share rather than how people get to your timeline . <PARA> the setting also made facebook ’ s search feature feel broken at times . for example , people told us that they found it confusing when they tried looking for someone who they knew personally and couldn ’ t find in search results , or when two people were in a facebook group and then couldn ’ t find each other through search . <PARA> the search setting was removed last year for people who weren ’ t using it . for the small percentage of people still using the setting , they will see reminders about it being removed in the coming weeks . <PARA> whether you ’ ve been using the setting or not , the best way to control what people can find about you on facebook is to choose who can see the individual things you share . <PARA> the setting was created when facebook was a simple directory of profiles and it was very limited . for example , it didn ’ t prevent people from navigating to your timeline by clicking your name in a story in news feed , or from a mutual friend ’ s timeline . today , people can also search facebook using graph search ( for example , “ people who live in <PARA> seattle ,”) making it even more important to control the privacy of the things you share rather than how people get to your timeline . <PARA> the setting also made facebook ’ s search feature feel broken at times . for example , people told us that they found it confusing when they tried looking for someone who they knew personally and couldn ’ t find in search results , or when two people were in a facebook group and then couldn ’ t find each other through search . <PARA> the search setting was removed last year for people who weren ’ t using it . for the small percentage of people still using the setting , they will see reminders about it being removed in the coming weeks . <PARA> whether you ’ ve been using the setting or not , the best way to control what people can find about you on facebook is to choose who can see the individual things you share . <PARA> this development did not , as claimed in some alarmist messages spread on the internet , “ delete all privacy settings on facebook ,” nor did facebook “ get rid of its privacy policy ” ( and the change certainly had nothing to do with the obama administration or the u . s . government ). all of facebook ’ s other privacy controls and policies remain in place , and while the “ who can look up your timeline by name ?” setting had some utility for helping facebook users be less visible to those who might be searching for them , it didn ’ t absolutely prevent others from finding them : <PARA> [ the setting ] wasn ’ t perfect . it would not have stopped , for example , facebook users from being able to access profiles if those users had been tagged in a public post or picture . still , it did help those users to keep a lower profile on the social network , such as those trying to hide their profiles from abusive ex - partners or harassment . <PARA> there is no equivalent function for preventing other people from finding a facebook user by name in the search bar , as facebook has been moving towards prompting users to maintain privacy on an item -

false	on 24 june 2016 , facebook user jeff stern published the above - reproduced facebook status update alongside three images of united nations ( un ) armored vehicles he ’ d purportedly spotted on that date along interstate 81 ( i - 81 ) near lexington , virginia : <PARA> the images and post were shared tens of thousands of times on facebook , and they even inspired their own daily mail article pondering whether “ the u . n . is preparing [ to respond to ] economic collapse in america .” the daily mail ( a publication that seldom , if ever , allows the truth to stand in the way of a good story ) apparently based their “ reporting ” on nothing more than some facebook - posted photographs : <PARA> unlike the daily mail , we contacted alpine armoring , the manufacturer named in their article , to inquire about the images . according to an individual with whom we spoke at alpine , the vehicles seen in these photographs were purchased by the united nations for use outside the united states . a number of defense industry manufacturers are based in and around washington , d . c . ( a region that includes virginia ) for obvious logistical reasons , and the representative confirmed that the trucks were ordered by the un for use in locations abroad . <PARA> after manufacturing , the un vehicles require transportation to their final ports of call inside the u . s ., and driving them to those final embarkation points could potentially put several thousand miles on them prior to their being loaded onto cargo planes or ships , so the trucks seen here were loaded onto a flatbed truck and transported in that fashion . it is a reasonable inference that , depending on their route and final destination , the same trucks would be spotted in other southern states ( particularly if they were to be sent abroad via a cargo ship leaving from a southern port ). it isn ’ t clear whether rumors of the trucks being spotted in kentucky were accurate , or if social media users confused lexington , virginia , with lexington , kentucky . <PARA> it is true that the un vehicles spotted in lexington were transported via i - 81 , but they were on their way to an undisclosed destination abroad and are not being deployed for use within the united states . the rumor associated with them was not unlike reports from october 2014 about a “ large truck convoy ” in virginia , which also did not result in the imposition of martial law or a un takeover . it also bore resemblance to long - circulating rumors about the uncovering of a plot to impose martial law via an overturned tractor - trailer carrying portentous signs , which has traveled around the web since 1999 despite the fact its claims never came to pass .
false	jeffrey j . rothschild , an american businessman now in his mid - sixties , is a successful engineer , entrepreneur , and former facebook vice president whose net worth , according to forbes , exceeds $ 3 billion . <PARA> he is also , if online conspiracy theorists are to be believed , a thought leader in a cia - backed new world order plot to exterminate most of the world ’ s population and enslave the survivors . in internet memes making the rounds since 2013 , rothschild is quoted as saying a third world war will be required to accomplish these goals : <PARA> to unpack some of those buzzwords , in conspiracist circles “ new world order ” refers to the end result of an intricate plan set in motion ages ago by the world ’ s wealthiest and most powerful elites ( also known as “ the illuminati “) to replace the existing international framework of sovereign states with a totalitarian one - world government ; every human being who is not a member of that elite will be enslaved under a “ globalized feudalist system ” in which which private ownership and individual freedom will have been eliminated ; and “ rothschild ” is a surname the former facebook executive happens to share with a prominent jewish family long supposed to be at the heart of conspiracies aimed at world domination . <PARA> much as it may disappoint anti - semitic conspiracy theorists , however , forbes says that despite his great personal wealth jeff rothschild isn ’ t related to the august banking family whose patriarch was mayer amschel rothschild ( 1744 - 1812 ) of frankfurt , germany . jeff rothschild ’ s father , william b . rothschild , inherited a rubber import business from his father , marcus rothschild , whose name appears nowhere in the mayer rothschild family tree . <PARA> and although jeff rothschild did speak at a conference of chinese and american entrepreneurs and investors in january 2013 ( at which the above photo was taken ), the event took place in santa clara , california ( not china ), and there is no record of him saying anything about a new world order , a third world war , or a globalized feudal system . nor have we been able to find such references in any other public statements uttered by jeff rothschild over the past two decades . <PARA> this utter lack of evidence hasn ’ t stopped anyone from promulgating these falsehoods , however . we ran across a similar quote shared by someone using the twitter handle “ truther monkey ” in 2014 : <PARA> though their precise points of origin are uncertain , we traced both quotes to a 3 august 2013 post on a now - defunct “ underground anarchist ” blog called anarchadia . crucially , the anonymous author of the post cited no sources authenticating the statements . <PARA> “ where is the evidence he actually said these things ?” asked someone in the comments section of the page . <PARA> “ where is the evidence he didn ’ t ?” was the response — a low evidentiary bar indeed . <PARA> as is the case in so much conspiracist discourse , the very existence of the quotes , if real , would be self - contradictory anyway . by definition , the illuminati conduct their business in absolute secrecy , yet we find them , time and time again ( going all the way back to the fictitious 1903 protocols of the elders of zion ), allegedly revealing their entire subversive agenda in public . <PARA> if that ’ s as secretive they can be , we have nothing to fear from our supposed illuminati overlords .

false	the question posed above is not a claim we ever anticipated investigating , but we ’ ll start by noting we found no evidence that the american dental association ( ada ) ever issued a statement regarding the effectiveness of semen as a cavity prevention tool , nor could we can determine any viable mechanism by which the transient presence of semen in one ’ s mouth would affect the build - up of plaque or tartar . <PARA> a search of the ada ’ s website for the word “ semen ” reveals seven hits , none of which make any claims about that substance ’ s potential use as part of dental hygiene regimen . <PARA> this claim appears to have its roots in a sophomoric ( nsfw ) joke , but claims regarding the effectiveness of semen as a dental health supplement are nonetheless often presented as quirky science facts . one example , which likely invokes a different method than standard forms of plaque or tartar removal , comes from a women ’ s health magazine post titled “ 18 sexy excuses to hop into bed ”: <PARA> while technically factual , this statement ignores the hard truth that the amount of semen needed to provide any appreciable amount of these minerals would shock even the most seasoned pornographer . <PARA> based on a review of studies published in 2005 , semen contains ( per 100 ml ) about 17 mg of zinc and 30 mg of calcium , while the recommended daily intake of zinc is 8 mg for adult women and 11 mg for adult men . for calcium , the daily value for adult men and women is 1000 mg . <PARA> however , other studies suggest that the average human male ’ s ejaculation produces around 3 - 4 ml of semen , so at the low end of that range , 16 to 22 ejaculations would be needed per day to supply the recommended daily intake of zinc , and 1 , 111 ejaculations to obtain the recommended daily intake of calcium .
true	mostly true <PARA> origins : on 15 june 2015 the women ’ s rights - focused group ultraviolet published the above - displayed image , addressing the record of republican presidential hopeful jeb bush , to their facebook page . after many viewers questioned the veracity of the claims made about bush and his record on women ’ s issues , the post was edited to include supporting citations for its entries ; but earlier versions of the post continued to circulate without it . <PARA> the numbered claims and their attendant backgrounds are as follows : <PARA> this statement stemmed from a 2003 case involving a 22 - year - old , severely developmentally disabled florida woman who had been living in state - supervised facilities for most of her life . she had become pregnant after being raped while living in a group home and had no family to make decisions on her behalf ; and ( even though neither the woman herself nor anyone caring for her had sought to abort the fetus ) governor bush stepped in and asked the court to intervene in this “ uniquely troubling situation ” and appoint a representative to protect the fetus ’ s rights : <PARA> the statement originated with the florida adoption act of 2001 ( more commonly known as “ bill 141 ” or the “ scarlet letter ” law ), which overhauled the state ’ s adoption regulations with the stated goal of trying to “ provide greater finality once the adoption is approved , and to avoid circumstances where future challenges to the adoption disrupt the life of the child .” the bill was inspired , in part , by the three - year fight over baby emily , whose father , a convicted rapist , had contested her adoption . ( the florida supreme court ruled in favor of emily ’ s adoptive parents in 1995 .) <PARA> the law required that any woman who was planning to put her infant up for adoption but did not know the identity of the child ’ s father first had to run newspaper advertisements once a week for a month in the community where the child might have been conceived disclosing their names , ages , height , hair and eye color , race and weight , the child ’ s name and birthplace , a description of the possible father , and details of the dates and places of sexual encounters that might have produced the child . <PARA> advocates of the bill maintained that it protected the rights of men who may not have known they had fathered children and that it would “ minimize last - minute challenges from a biological father , as well as challenges a father might bring after an adoption has been made legal ,” while critics contended that it was “ draconian and humiliating ,” and that governor bush ’ s failure to veto the bill indicated he supporting the “ shaming ” of women for their sexual activity . <PARA> although jeb bush had previously lamented the lack of social stigma for having children outside of marriage ( writing in his 1995 book profiles in character that “ one of the reasons more young women are giving birth out of wedlock and more young men are walking away from their paternal obligations is that there is no longer a stigma attached to this behavior , no reason to feel shame ”), he did not fully approve of bill 141 and said that the state should not be “ stigmatizing women ”: <PARA> gov . bush also stated in a letter to secretary of state katherine harris that he felt the bill put too much responsibility on the birth mother to locate the father , and while he did not veto the “ scarlet letter ” bill , neither did he sign it : he passively allowed it to become law in the expectation that legislators would revise the section requiring the publication of women ’ s sexual histories <PARA> governor bush repealed the “ scarlet letter ” law in may 2003 , signing a replacement measure that instituted the paternity registry mentioned above . the repeal had become something of a moot issue by then , however , as an appeals court had ruled the previous month that it was unconstitutional for the state to require women and underage girls to disclose their sexual histories , even in cases of consensual sex . <PARA> the claim that jeb bush hired a staffer who called women “ sluts ” is true in a literal sense , although the staffer ’ s employment by bush was very short - lived , as he immediately left his position after the controversy about some of his several - year - old tweets hit the news . <PARA> this brouhaha originated with jeb bush ’ s temporary hiring in february 2015 of hipster . com co - founder ethan czahor as his chief technology officer , in charge of handling the preparations for bush ’ s presidential run . almost immediately after the hiring was announced , czahor ’ s twitter history was dissected and shared by various media outlets . among their findings were a handful of tweets published by czahor in 2009 and 2010 in which he made insensitive remarks about women and used the word “ sluts ” in reference to them . a bush spokesman quickly characterized the comments as “ inappropriate ” and indicated that czahor had been directed to promptly delete them . <PARA> one day later , czahor resigned from his newly - assigned position and apologized for his previous remarks . <PARA> as is often the case with political memes , sometimes the basic assertions check out but are misleading or inaccurate due to a lack of context . so while it ’ s true that jeb bush made a statement that resembled the one quoted above , it has been reproduced without any relevant contextual information . <PARA> the controversial quote was one bush uttered during the 1994 florida gubernatorial campaign ; and the thrust of his statement was that he favored setting a two - year limit on welfare benefits , requiring recipients after that period to find work or other assistance on their own : <PARA> although a generous interpretation of this statement might be to say that jeb bush was simply enumerating the several possibilities that ( female ) welfare recipients could avail themselves of after the expiration of their benefits , he made it clear later that he felt unmarried women were a significant contribution to the welfare problem : <PARA> in support of this claim , ultraviolet cited an april 2015 salon article , which in turn referenced an interview bush gave to focus on the family on 13 april 2015 . during the course of that interview , bush lauded florida ’ s role as an outlier in funding “ crisis pregnancy centers ” ( cpcs ) during his tenure as governor : <PARA> while jeb bush was governor of florida , the state funded crisis pregnancy centers through the sales of ‘ choose life ’ specialty license plates ( under legislation signed into law by bush in 1999 ) and through the creation of the florida pregnancy support services program ( which was introduced by bush in 2005 ): <PARA> florida was not alone in that regard , however : several other states , including minnesota , nebraska , north dakota , and texas , approved state funding of crisis pregnancy centers during the same timeframe . moreover , between 2001 and 2006 over $ 60 million in federal funds were given to crisis pregnancy centers , in large part through abstinence - only programs initiated during the administration of jeb ’ s brother , president george w . bush . <PARA> originally published : 21 june 2015 <PARA> canedy , dana . “ gov . jeb bush to seek guardian for fetus of rape victim .” the new york times . 15 may 2003 . <PARA> canedy , dana . “ florida ‘ scarlet letter ’ law is repealed by gov . bush .” the new york times . 31 may 2003 . <PARA> dahlburg , john - thor . “ florida wants all the details from mothers in adoption notices .” los angeles times . 21 august 2002 . <PARA> dahlburg , john - thor . “ florida ends ‘ scarlet letter ’ adoption law .” los angeles times . 31 may 2003 . <PARA> manes , billy . “ immaculate deception .” orlando weekly . 26 february 2009 . <PARA> griffin , michael . “ smith rips bush ’ s ‘ find a husband ’ tip for women on welfare .” orlando sentinel . 7 september 1994 . <PARA> hongo , hudson . “ new jeb bush hire deletes comments about sluts , gays from twitter .” gawker . 9 february 2015 . <PARA> kaczynski , andrew . “ jeb bush chief technology officer resigns after deleting old tweets about ‘ sluts .'” buzzfeed . 10 february 2015 . <PARA> kurtzleben , danielle . “ jeb bush and florida ’ s ‘ scarlet letter law ,’ explained .” npr . 10 june 2015 . <PARA> mcdonough , katie . “ jeb ’ s abortion nightmare .” salon . 14 april 2015 . <PARA> miller , zeke j . “ jeb bush hires co - founder of hipster . com .” time . 9 february 2015 . <PARA> simon , stephanie . “ states fund antiabortion advice .” los angeles times . 11 february 2007 .

unproven	there have been some rumblings around the office about the future of this company , and more specifically , your job . as you know , the economy has changed for the worse and presents many challenges . however , the good news is this : the economy doesn ’ t pose a threat to your job . what does threaten your job however , is the changing political landscape in this country . <PARA> of course , as your employer , i am forbidden to tell you whom to vote for – it is against the law to discriminate based on political affiliation , race , creed , religion , etc . please vote who you think will serve your interests the best . <PARA> however , let me tell you some little tidbits of fact which might help you decide what is in your best interest . <PARA> first , while it is easy to spew rhetoric that casts employers against employees , you have to understand that for every business owner there is a back story . this back story is often neglected and overshadowed by what you see and hear . sure , you see me park my mercedes outside . you ’ ve seen my big home at last year ’ s christmas party . i ’ m sure all these flashy icons of luxury conjure up some idealized thoughts about my life . <PARA> however , what you don ’ t see is the back story . <PARA> i started this company 12 years ago . at that time , i lived in a 300 square foot studio apartment for 3 years . my entire living space was converted into an office so i could put forth 100 % effort into building a company , which by the way , would eventually employ you . <PARA> my diet consisted of ramen pride noodles because every dollar i spent went back into this company . i drove a rusty toyota corolla with a defective transmission . i didn ’ t have time to date . often times , i stayed home on weekends , while my friends went out drinking and partying . in fact , i was married to my business — hard work , discipline , and sacrifice . <PARA> meanwhile , my friends got jobs . they worked 40 hours a week and made a modest $ 50k a year and spent every dime they earned . they drove flashy cars and lived in expensive homes and wore fancy designer clothes . instead of hitting the nordstrom ’ s for the latest hot fashion item , i was trolling through the goodwill store extracting any clothing item that didn ’ t look like it was birthed in the 70 ’ s . my friends refinanced their mortgages and lived a life of luxury . i , however , did not . i put my time , my money , and my life into a business with a vision that eventually , some day , i too , will be able to afford these luxuries my friends supposedly had . <PARA> so , while you physically arrive at the office at 9am , mentally check in at about noon , and then leave at 5pm , i don ’ t . there is no “ off ” button for me . when you leave the office , you are done and you have a weekend all to yourself . i unfortunately do not have the freedom . i eat , ****, and breathe this company every minute of the day . there is no rest . there is no weekend . there is no happy hour . every day this business is attached to my hip like a 1 year old special - needs child . you , of course , only see the fruits of that garden — the nice house , the mercedes , the vacations ... you never realize the back story and the sacrifices i ’ ve made . <PARA> now , the economy is falling apart and i , the guy that made all the right decisions and saved his money , have to bail - out all the people who didn ’ t . the people that overspent their paychecks suddenly feel entitled to the same luxuries that i earned and sacrificed a decade of my life for . <PARA> yes , business ownership has is benefits but the price i ’ ve paid is steep and without wounds . <PARA> unfortunately , the cost of running this business , and employing you , is starting to eclipse the threshold of marginal benefit and let me tell you why : <PARA> i am being taxed to death and the government thinks i don ’ t pay enough . i have state taxes . federal taxes . property taxes . sales and use taxes . payroll taxes . workers compensation taxes . unemployment taxes . taxes on taxes . i have to hire a tax man to manage all these taxes and then guess what ? i have to pay taxes for employing him . government mandates and regulations and all the accounting that goes with it , now occupy most of my time . on oct 15th , i wrote a check to the us treasury for $ 288 , 000 for quarterly taxes . you know what my “ stimulus ” check was ? zero . nada . zilch . <PARA> the question i have is this : who is stimulating the economy ? me , the guy who has provided 14 people good paying jobs and serves over 2 , 200 , 000 people per year with a flourishing business ? or , the single mother sitting at home pregnant with her fourth child waiting for her next welfare check ? obviously , government feels the latter is the economic stimulus of this country . <PARA> the fact is , if i deducted ( read : stole ) 50 % of your paycheck you ’ d quit and you wouldn ’ t work here . i mean , why should you ? that ’ s nuts . who wants to get rewarded only 50 % of their hard work ? well , i agree which is why your job is in jeopardy . <PARA> here is what many of you don ’ t understand ... to stimulate the economy you need to stimulate what runs the economy . had suddenly government mandated to me that i didn ’ t need to pay taxes , guess what ? instead of depositing that $ 288 , 000 into the washington black - hole , i would have spent it , hired more employees , and generated substantial economic growth . my employees would have enjoyed the wealth of that tax cut in the form of promotions and better salaries . but you can forget it now . <PARA> when you have a comatose man on the verge of death , you don ’ t defibrillate and shock his thumb thinking that will bring him back to life , do you ? or , do you defibrillate his heart ? business is at the heart of america and always has been . to restart it , you must stimulate it , not kill it . suddenly , the power brokers in washington believe the mud of america are the essential drivers of the american economic engine . nothing could be further from the truth and this is the type of change you can keep . <PARA> so where am i going with all this ? <PARA> it ’ s quite simple . <PARA> if any new taxes are levied on me , or my company , my reaction will be swift and simple . i fire you . i fire your co - workers . you can then plead with the government to pay for your mortgage , your suv , and your child ’ s <PARA> future . frankly , it isn ’ t my problem anymore . <PARA> then , i will close this company down , move to another country , and retire . you see , i ’ m done . i ’ m done with a country that penalizes the productive and gives to the unproductive . my motivation to work and to provide jobs will be destroyed , and with it , will be my citizenship . <PARA> while tax cuts to 95 % of america sounds great on paper , don ’ t forget the back story : if there is no job , there is no income to tax . a tax cut on zero dollars is zero . <PARA> so , when you make decision to vote , ask yourself , who understands the economics of business ownership and who doesn ’ t ? whose policies will endanger your job ? <PARA> answer those questions and you should know who might be the one capable of saving your job . while the media wants to tell you “ it ’ s the economy stupid ” i ’ m telling you it isn ’ t . <PARA> if you lose your job , it won ’ t be at the hands of the economy ; it will be at the hands of a political hurricane that swept through this country , steamrolled the constitution , and will have changed its landscape forever . if that happens , you can find me in south caribbean sitting on a beach , retired , and with no employees to worry about . <PARA> signed , <PARA> your boss <PARA> origins : in the ramp - up towards the 2008 presidential election and in its wake , a number of anonymous “ here ’ s how you , the ones who voted for him , will directly suffer from a barack obama presidency ” missives landed in inboxes everywhere . one such was putatively from a hard - working and generous grandfather telling his beloved liberal granddaughter that her support for obama meant grandpa was no longer going to be in a position to help her financially . another was supposedly penned by ceo to his 140 employees informing them that thanks to the new taxes now surely headed his way , he ’ d have to lay off a few of them , so he was starting with those whose cars sported obama bumper stickers .” <PARA> the “ to all my valued employees ” letter quoted above is another of such ilk . in it , a boss threatens to shut down his company ( thus wiping out the livelihoods of the 14 people who work there ) if any more taxes are levied upon him , an outcome he views a virtual <PARA> certainty under an obama presidency . the piece is perhaps best viewed as an attempt to put into real - world terms the possible consequences to average folks if business is interfered with to the point of no longer being able to operate rather than as an actual letter sent by a real boss to his employees . <PARA> although our earliest sighting of this item dates to 3 november 2008 , textual clues within the missive ( such as <PARA> “ please vote who you think will serve your interests the best ” and “ so , when you make decision to vote ”) indicate it was likely penned sooner than just the day before the 2008 presidential election . <PARA> the original author of this piece is unknown to us . while some versions are merely signed “ your boss ,” others are attributed to michael a . crowley of wake forest , north carolina , via inclusion of his signature block at the end of the piece . crowley himself denies authorship , saying : <PARA> in reference to the “ to all my valued employees ” letter currently circulating the internet : <PARA> this letter was forwarded to me by a colleague . while the letter may indeed be authentic , i was not the author and i do not know the identity of the original author . i forwarded it to the “ john mccain joe the plumbers ” email group prior to the election . someone moved my contact information into the body of the message making it appear that i was the author of the letter . i would appreciate your removing my contact information prior to forwarding this message . <PARA> michael a . crowley , pe <PARA> this letter was forwarded to me by a colleague . while the letter may indeed be authentic , i was not the author and i do not know the identity of the original author . i forwarded it to the “ john mccain joe the plumbers ” email group prior to the election . someone moved my contact information into the body of the message making it appear that i was the author of the letter . i would appreciate your removing my contact information prior to forwarding this message . <PARA> michael a . crowley , pe <PARA> while sometimes people looking to distance themselves from soapbox pieces they ’ ve penned subsequently claim they found such contentious items elsewhere on the internet and merely forwarded them to others , that is not the case here . more than just crowley ’ s own words of denial support his claim of non - authorship , with the key to that proof lying in the very signature block that has worked to convince so many of his being the real “ boss ” behind the letter . <PARA> that signature block identifies his firm as crowley , crisp & associates , inc ., a now defunct business entity that ( according to north carolina ’ s secretary of state ) was formed in may 2007 . the missive so widely laid at crowley ’ s feet states “ i started this company 12 years ago .” twelve years prior to 2008 was 1996 . ( his current firm , crowley & associates , inc ., was formed in october 2000 .) were crowley the actual author , that line about when he began his company would have read “ last year ” or “ 8 years ago .” <PARA> the response to the missive falsely attributed to him prompted michael crowley to pen his own letter on the plight of the small business owner , which can be read here . <PARA> in october 2012 , david siegel , the founder and ceo of westgate resorts , sent a modified version of this letter to all of his employees . he based his missive on that much - circulated 2008 piece , saying of his offering : “ i did use the letter that had circulated before as a guideline , but i changed it [ to fit my circumstances ]. it speaks the truth and it gives [ employees ] something to think about when they go to the polls .”
false	on 23 march 2016 , maricopa county ( arizona ) recorder helen purcell said that she was to blame for the lengthy lines voters encountered during the state ’ s presidential preference election in march 2016 — lines that critics contended resulted from a deliberate closure of polling places intended to suppress certain segments of the voting populace : <PARA> while purcell may have made some “ bad decisions ” that led to long voting lines in arizona , some media outlets additionally accused her of deliberately attempting to suppress the vote , stating that she had deep ties to the clinton campaign due to her alleged marriage to the late lieutenant governor of arkansas joe purcell : <PARA> it ’ s true that joe purcell served as lieutenant governor under bill clinton . it ’ s also true that joe purcell was married to a woman named helen hale purcell . but while the late joe purcell ’ s wife and the maricopa county arizona recorder bear similar names , they are not the same person . <PARA> according to a biography on the maricopa county government web site , that county ’ s recorder , helen purcell , was born in topeka , kansas , and has been living in phoenix since 1964 ( the latter being an unusual place of residence if her husband was serving as lieutenant governor of arkansas from 1975 – 1981 ). also , although helen purcell ’ s age isn ’ t listed on the maricopa county government web site , recent photographs of her show a woman far too young to have been college age in 1948 , as joe purcell ’ s future wife was when he met her in arkansas . <PARA> it should also be noted that helen purcell is listed as a republican , making it even more improbable that she somehow conspired to do the clintons ’ bidding .
unproven	origins : the <PARA> above - quoted list of washday chores has surfaced in a number of places , including a museum display in arrowtown , new zealand titled “ grandma ’ s washday .” well before the internet , it was circulated as xeroxlore , with photocopied versions passing from hand to hand . <PARA> it has been kicking about for a very long time . while its folksy spelling is in some versions further exaggerated and in other iterations cleaned up , the order of the items and their contents remain relatively stable . folklorist jan harold brunvand reports encountering it in a 1981 south carolina folklore journal , which had in turn found it in a 1975 newspaper . his article about this item of contemporary lore prompted a woman to send him a typed copy of a 13 - item list that , she said , hung in a handwritten version “ above my mother ’ s wringer washer in a little town in the wheat country of colorado for as long as i can remember . that was during the forties .” <PARA> it also appeared in a kansas newspaper in 1954 . the columnist who presented it said the item came to him as a news clipping from a reader , intelligence that indicates it had been published in a newspaper prior to that . <PARA> our own find of a closely related item comes from a book published in 1959 : <PARA> [ cerf , 1959 ] <PARA> an anonymous friend mailed me the following little poem . i wish somebody could identify the author : <PARA> grandmother , on a winter ’ s day , milked the cows , <PARA> slopped the hogs , and got the children off to school ; <PARA> did a washing , mopped the floors , <PARA> washed the windows , and did some chores ; <PARA> cooked a dish of home - dried fruit , <PARA> pressed her husband ’ s sunday suit , <PARA> swept the parlor , made the bed , <PARA> baked a dozen loaves of bread , <PARA> split some firewood and lugged it in , <PARA> enough to fill the kitchen bin ; <PARA> cleaned the lamps and put in oil , <PARA> stewed some apples she thought would spoil ; <PARA> churned the butter , baked a cake , <PARA> then exclaimed , “ for goodness ’ sake , <PARA> the calves have got out of the pen ,” <PARA> and went out and chased them in again ; <PARA> gathered the eggs and locked the stable , <PARA> back to the house and set the table , <PARA> cooked a supper that was delicious , <PARA> and afterward washed up all the dishes ; <PARA> fed the cat and sprinkled the clothes , <PARA> mended a basketful of hose ; <PARA> then opened the organ and began to play <PARA> “ when you come to the end of a perfect day .” <PARA> an anonymous friend mailed me the following little poem . i wish somebody could identify the author : <PARA> grandmother , on a winter ’ s day , milked the cows , <PARA> slopped the hogs , and got the children off to school ; <PARA> did a washing , mopped the floors , <PARA> washed the windows , and did some chores ; <PARA> cooked a dish of home - dried fruit , <PARA> pressed her husband ’ s sunday suit , <PARA> swept the parlor , made the bed , <PARA> baked a dozen loaves of bread , <PARA> split some firewood and lugged it in , <PARA> enough to fill the kitchen bin ; <PARA> cleaned the lamps and put in oil , <PARA> stewed some apples she thought would spoil ; <PARA> churned the butter , baked a cake , <PARA> then exclaimed , “ for goodness ’ sake , <PARA> the calves have got out of the pen ,” <PARA> and went out and chased them in again ; <PARA> gathered the eggs and locked the stable , <PARA> back to the house and set the table , <PARA> cooked a supper that was delicious , <PARA> and afterward washed up all the dishes ; <PARA> fed the cat and sprinkled the clothes , <PARA> mended a basketful of hose ; <PARA> then opened the organ and began to play <PARA> “ when you come to the end of a perfect day .” <PARA> yet the “ perfect day ” poem predates even that — a copy was found in an ohio newspaper in 1926 . <PARA> while undoubtedly these poems and lists have been around for quite a while , it is not necessarily true they date back to the days supposedly being lauded . the desire to view earlier eras through rose - tinged lenses did not begin with this generation ; nostalgia for “ the good old days ” is an ordinary part of the human experience . just as each generation views its young people as going to hell in a handbasket , so does it regard the times of its grandfathers as simple , honest , and more wholesome . forgotten are dread disease that snuffed out so many lives , crushing poverty , and widespread discrimination against anyone who was not both white and male ; instead , the long hours of back - breaking hard work endured by previous generations are presented as having been a matter of choice , and a noble one at that . lists and poems like these are far more about how we imagine our forebears to have cheerfully shouldered their hardships rather than how they actually lived them . <PARA> barbara “ fond remembrances of things that never were ” mikkelson

false	false <PARA> examples : [ collected via e - mail , july 2015 ] <PARA> origins : on 16 july 2015 , a facebook user published the following status update : <PARA> this narrative improbably presumes that walmart decided to eliminate the sale of all bible - related merchandise in their stores yet left such merchandise out on their stores shelves , somehow coded their sales system to recognize any bible - related item ( even a composition book that simply bore a bible verse on its cover ), and brazenly informed their customers about their new sales ban on all things biblical . <PARA> a cursory search of walmart . com returned number of results for “ sadie robertson ,” and searching “ made in the usa ” similarly turned up many products ( upwards of 400 , 000 ). a query entered for “ bible ” was also quite fruitful , and searching for products via the term “ jesus ” led to thousands of results ( including artwork and home decor that belied the claim the retailer sought to eradicate overtly religious merchandise ). following on from that , a search for “ american flag ” yielded thousands of items , several of which were decorative tchotchkes for the home . <PARA> despite clear evidence to the contrary , a separate facebook user referenced the rumor about walmart ’ s removing obviously american and / or christian items from their stores in an unrelated comment thread [ opens to video ] on walmart ’ s facebook wall . in a 19 july 2015 comment , the user asked : <PARA> in a 20 july 2015 reply , walmart ’ s verified facebook account stated that the rumor was untrue and indicated that the chain planned to increase ( not ban ) the number of stocked products made in the united states : <PARA> this latter portion of this rumor likely originated with walmart ’ s temporarily directing stores to remove “ made in the u . s . a .” signs due to problems with foreign - made merchandise being tagged as such . <PARA> originally published : 26 july 2015
mixture	a vintage piece of glurge , one which appears to have been in continuous circulation since at least 1948 , has been through a variety of alterations , with names being added and dropped from the list , the fates of the various men changing in severity , and different morals being tacked onto the end . in modern versions many of the names are have become so distorted through mistranscription to be almost unrecognizable : <PARA> the introductory section about all these men meeting at chicago ’ s edgewater beach hotel in 1923 is apocryphal : contemporaneous newspapers made no mention of such a meeting nor suggested any event that could plausibly have brought so many prominent men from several diverse industries to chicago all at the same time . also , as noted below , some of the entries are anachronistic in that they list men who did not yet hold the positions ascribed to them in 1923 . after sifting through stacks and stacks of dusty old newspapers , we managed to assemble capsule biographies of the men listed in all the variations of this piece we ’ ve collected so far : <PARA> in 1945 , while the 55 - year - old fraser was president of first national bank of new york , he shot himself in the head at his summer home in north granville , ny . he left behind a suicide note stating that he had been “ depressed mentally and [ had ] suffered from melancholia that gets steadily worse .” obituaries noted that he had been in “ low spirits ” since the death of his wife two years earlier . <PARA> the lessons we ’ re to take from this item are many and varied : money and power don ’ t bring happiness so be careful what dreams you pursue ; a lust for wealth is necessarily a corrupting goal ; playing golf more and working less will do wonders for your lifespan ( and possibly your wallet ). whether one could prove any of these lessons from the examples offered is problematic , as the data have been carefully selected to establish the desired conclusions . one could just as easily draw up a very long list of wealthy and powerful men who did not lose great sums of money , who did not earn their fortunes through fraud , and who lived long , healthy , and happy lives , but none of their names appear here . and by its very nature the list offered here is somewhat self - selecting for failure in the sense that : <PARA> as with most glurge , we might scratch the surface of this one to find a darker subtext beneath : only a few of us lead lives of privilege , it says ; the rest of us can take comfort in a skewed “ sour grapes ” tale that casts those privileged few as corrupt individuals struggling through flawed , unhappy existences , inevitably suffering disastrous losses of their wealth and health . perhaps it ’ s better we not obscure the idea that happiness and misery , kindness and greed , and good works and bad deeds are within the capacities of us all , not merely a select few . <PARA> sightings : this list appears in the 1997 financial advice bestseller rich dad , poor dad .
unproven	on 2 october 2016 , the web site true pundit published an article reporting that hillary clinton had supposedly attempted to order a drone strike on wikileaks founder julian assange in order to “ silence ” that organization ’ s efforts : <PARA> the claim might not have seemed so incredible to some readers , as assange himself had previously voiced the possibility of his being assassinated by drone , although even in his imaginings the chances of such an action ( initiated by the cia , not by hillary clinton ) were not likely : <PARA> first of all , the only cited source documenting that hillary clinton had ever suggested ( even in jest ) that a drone strike could take out julian assange was “ sources at the state department ,” a vague and anonymous reference that does not yield to verification . second , the claim that hillary clinton or her aides had either hinted or directly ordered remote assassination of assange in november 2010 focused on a questionable interpretation of the terms “ legal and nonlegal strategies ” that appeared in the subject line of e - mails sent by anne - marie slaughter , director of policy planning at the u . s . department of state and released via wikileaks ’ first searchable hillary clinton e - mail archive in march 2016 . <PARA> the e - mails in question purportedly followed clinton ’ s proposing that julian assange be targeted by a drone strike : <PARA> however , the text of those e - mails ( located here and here ) neither said nor implied anything of the sort : <PARA> the thrust of true pundit ’ s article hinged almost entirely on claiming that the term “ nonlegal ” essentially means the same thing as “ illegal ,” and much of the article ’ s content delved into discussing why illegal methods for dealing with a wikileaks issue would be improper . however , “ nonlegal ” also bears a distinctly different meaning than “ illegal ”; the former can be used to distinguish discussions dealing with the law and legalities from discussions that don ’ t involve legal matters : <PARA> moreover , anne - marie slaughter ’ s only reference to “ nonlegal ” methods were some “ very good suggestions about how to handle our public diplomacy ” ( included in an unavailable appended memo ). unless “ public diplomacy ” is reasonable code for “ drone strike ,” the most logical reading of the e - mail chain would be that the meeting referenced in the e - mail explored what legal actions could be taken to minimize damage from wikileaks , with a secondary focus on “ nonlegal ” ( i . e ., not related to law enforcement or litigation ) approaches such as diplomacy and public relations . <PARA> on 4 october 2016 clinton answered a question about whether the rumor was accurate , responding that she didn ’ t “ recall any joke ... [ reference to targeting assange with a drone ] would have been a joke ”
false	south african comedian trevor noah often talks about growing up under apartheid as the child of a black mother and white father . so if it seems a stretch that the famously mixed - race host of comedy central ’ s long - running parody news program “ the daily show ” would call on non - whites to unite in anger against white people in south africa , it ’ s because he didn ’ t . <PARA> the fake quote attributed to noah has been circulating on the internet , in varying forms and countries , since at least 2017 , according to an investigation by digital forensic research lab , a project of the international affairs think tank atlantic council , which traces the sources of online disinformation . <PARA> in a nutshell , the quote calls on immigrants and black south africans to unite in their anger toward white south africans , who control most of the country ’ s wealth . “ whites in south africa makes up about 8 . 7 % of the population and controls over 85 % wealth ,” the quote states , then continues , “ i say that your anger and outrage is misplaced . african immigrants don ’ t own lands , don ’ t run companies , don ’ t operate trophy hunting companies , do not ship out capital to european banks .” <PARA> it ’ s a toxic quote , considering that its spread online coincides with deadly xenophobic violence in south africa . and even though it isn ’ t authentic , it spread on various african websites and on social media . <PARA> the sharing of the quote to u . s . readers got a boost from frequent purveyors of online disinformation , including alex jones ’ conspiracy site infowars , as well as jim hoft , who runs the junk news site gateway pundit , and jack posobiec , a right - wing internet personality who helped spread the pizzagate conspiracy theory . <PARA> the quote has changed over time . according to the digital forensic research lab , the earliest version of it has been on the internet since feb . 20 , 2017 , when a nigerian website published it and attributed it to noah without any citations . it was then reproduced by a malawian website with the claim that noah gave the markedly unfunny monologue while hosting his comedy show . <PARA> the quote hadn ’ t seen much activity since early 2017 but then reemerged with the start of violence targeting immigrants in south africa in early september 2019 . <PARA> in 2017 , noah made a comment about race but it was the inverse of the fake one attributed to him . noah told canadian broadcaster cbc that apartheid represents one of the easiest forms of control , accomplished by “[ convincing people ] that they are different — even black people by the way — and [ separating ] them into groups that now spend more time trying to fight each other than realizing that they all share a common goal .” <PARA> noah also authored a book entitled “ born a crime ” about his experience growing up under apartheid as a mixed - race child , as his parents ’ union at the time was a violation of south african law under apartheid . <PARA> for reference , the version of the quote circulating in the u . s . as of this writing states in full :
false	joke : general motors issued a caustic press release in response to bill gates ’ comparison of advances in computing to the automotive industry . <PARA> examples : [ collected on the internet , 1999 ] <PARA> in response to bill ’ s comments , general motors issued a press release ( by mr . welch himself ) stating : <PARA> if gm had developed technology like microsoft , we would all be driving cars with the following characteristics : <PARA> 1 . for no reason at all , your car would crash twice a day . <PARA> 2 . every time they repainted the lines on the road , you would have to buy a new car . <PARA> 3 . occasionally , executing a manoeuver such as a left - turn would cause your car to shut down and refuse to restart , and you would have to reinstall the engine . <PARA> 4 . when your car died on the freeway for no reason , you would just accept this , restart and drive on . <PARA> 5 . only one person at a time could use the car , unless you bought ‘ car95 ’ or ‘ carnt ’, and then added more seats . <PARA> 6 . apple would make a car powered by the sun , reliable , five times as fast , and twice as easy to drive , but would run on only five per cent of the roads . <PARA> 7 . oil , water temperature and alternator warning lights would be replaced by a single ‘ general car default ’ warning light . <PARA> 8 . new seats would force every - one to have the same size butt . <PARA> 9 . the airbag would say ‘ are you sure ?’ before going off . <PARA> 10 . occasionally , for no reason , your car would lock you out and refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the door handle , turned the key , and grabbed the radio antenna . <PARA> 11 . gm would require all car buyers to also purchase a deluxe set of road maps from rand - mcnally ( a subsidiary of gm ), even though they neither need them nor want them . trying to delete this option would immediately cause the car ’ s performance to diminish by 50 per cent or more . moreover , gm would become a target for investigation by the justice department . <PARA> 12 . every time gm introduced a new model , car buyers would have to learn how to drive all over again because none of the controls would operate in the same manner as the old car . <PARA> 13 . you would press the ‘ start ’ button to shut off the engine . <PARA> origins : jokes sometimes take the long way around on their journeys from mere humor to “ this really happened ” tales . <PARA> the basic premise of this gag — the computer industry ’ s touting advances in computing technology by comparing them to the automotive industry is met by a stinging rejoinder from car manufacturers — began life as a mere three - line joke at least as far back as early 1997 : <PARA> there ’ s word in business circles that the computer industry likes to measure itself against the big three auto - makers . the comparison goes this way : if automotive technology had kept pace with silicon valley , motorists could buy a v - 32 engine that goes 10 , 000 m . p . h . or a 30 - pound car that gets 1 , 000 miles to the gallon — either one at a sticker price of less than $ 50 . detroit ’ s response : “ ok . but who would want a car that crashes twice a day ?” <PARA> microsoft ceo bill gates made a brief reference to the existing pc vs . automobiles price comparison concept during his remarks at the comdex computer exposition in november 1997 : <PARA> the pc industry is different than any other industry . the volume , the openness , the innovation , it ’ s really unequaled . in fact , comparisons are often done between this industry and others , and it ’ s just stunning when you look at it . the price of a mid - sized auto , it ’ s about double what it used to be . cereal , i admit i don ’ t buy that much cereal , but research shows that , too , has doubled in price . and if you take that and say , what would those prices be if it were like the pc industry , the car would cost about $ 27 , and the cereal would cost about one cent . so , i think there ’ s a lot to be learned by watching how this industry has done what it ’ s done . <PARA> as typically happens in the urban legend cycle , a generic tale that invoked types of businesses was quickly transformed into a version that specifically attributed it to the biggest and most well -

mixture	examples : [ collected via e - mail , october 2011 ] <PARA> i wanted to know if this is true cause people are talking about on facebook .... <PARA> heard on glenn beck ’ s radio show that on nov . 9 , 2011 the government is going to shut down all communications for 3 1 / 2 minutes beginning @ 2 pm <PARA> i just received and email stating that power in this nation is to be cut off on nov . 9th . is this true ? <PARA> heard that government was shutting down all methods of communication ( computers , t . v .’ s , etc .) for 3 minutes on <PARA> november 9 . is this true and if so , what ’ s the reason ? <PARA> origins : at 2 : 00 pm est on 9 november 2011 , the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) in coordination with the federal communications commission ( fcc ) and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ), will conduct the first nationwide test of the emergency alert system ( eas ). eas participants include broadcasters , satellite and digital radio and television , cable television and wireline video providers , whose programming will be temporarily interrupted for about three minutes in order to “ provide a critical public service to the nation as the resilient backbone of alert and warning when all other means of communication are unavailable .” as described by the fcc : <PARA> the eas is often used by state and local emergency managers to alert the public about emergencies and weather events . the system provides the ability to send messages regionally or nationally , though it has never been tested at these levels . a major disaster such as an earthquake or tsunami could require the use of the system to send life - saving information to the public . <PARA> according to fema , what people will see and hear during the nationwide eas test is as follows : <PARA> during the test , listeners will hear a message indicating that “ this is a test .” although the eas test may resemble the periodic , monthly eas tests that most americans are already familiar with , there will be some differences in what viewers will see and hear . the audio message will be the same for all eas participants ; <PARA> however , due to limitations in the eas , the video test message scroll may not be the same or indicate that “ this is a test .” this is due to the use of the live ean code — the same code that would be used in an actual emergency . the text at the top of the television screen may indicate that an “ emergency action notification has been issued .” this notification is used to disseminate a national alert and in this case , the test . in addition , the background image that appears on video screens during an alert may indicate that “ this is a test ,” but in some instances there might not be an image at all . <PARA> the test will last for approximately three minutes ; however this may vary across the country . while state and local eas messages are limited to 2 minutes , there is no time limit for national eas alerts . to evaluate whether the system properly interprets the national message code in the national eas test , the message duration must be longer than two minutes . <PARA> however , due to limitations in the eas , the video test message scroll may not be the same or indicate that “ this is a test .” this is due to the use of the live ean code — the same code that would be used in an actual emergency . the text at the top of the television screen may indicate that an “ emergency action notification has been issued .” this notification is used to disseminate a national alert and in this case , the test . in addition , the background image that appears on video screens during an alert may indicate that “ this is a test ,” but in some instances there might not be an image at all . <PARA> the test will last for approximately three minutes ; however this may vary across the country . while state and local eas messages are limited to 2 minutes , there is no time limit for national eas alerts . to evaluate whether the system properly interprets the national message code in the national eas test , the message duration must be longer than two minutes . <PARA> contrary to some of the rumors which have sprung out of news of the nationwide eas test ( as noted in the examples above ), the test will not involve the cutting off of power or general communications throughout the u . s .; just a temporary interruption of television and radio programming .
unproven	in february 2018 , president donald trump spawned yet another political controversy when he said that he would have intervened to stop a recent mass school shooting if had he been present at the scene , as rhe new york times reported : <PARA> president trump ’ s remarks prompted a wave of scoffing from critics who scornfully pointed out that he had obtained a series of student and medical deferments that kept him out of the military during the vietnam war era . but trump ’ s supporters backed him up by pointing to newspaper accounts from 1991 reporting that he had once confronted a baseball - bat - wielding mugger on the streets of new york city : <PARA> many readers reacted with skepticism to this information , disbelieving it because it seemed conveniently and suspiciously new to them after the contentious 2016 presidential campaign in which trump ’ s actions over the course of his life came under scrutiny . however , a google trends graph that illustrates search data demonstrated spikes of interest in the story over the previous two years : <PARA> the original new yorkdaily news report of the incident carried a dateline of 20 november 1991 and was syndicated to a number of regional newspapers : <PARA> the text of the article described trump , en route to a paula abdul concert in november 1991 , ordering his limo driver to pull over when he spotted a man wielding a bat attacking another man on the streets of manhattan : <PARA> determining how much of this account is true nearly three decades later is difficult , especially given trump ’ s long history of self - aggrandizing statements ( including his making self - publicizing phone calls to reporters while pretending to be someone else ). but unless one were to believe that the daily news was completely deceived or complicit in running an entirely fabricated story , replete with witness statements , this report would seem to have had some real - life incident behind it . <PARA> however , the public record of the incident all stemmed from a single report , and even that account was contradictory about exactly what took place . one named witness asserted that the would - be mugger had already run off by the time trump exited his limo , and the billionaire did nothing more than join a crowd of onlookers after the fact . another anonymous witness supported trump ’ s account , maintaining that the bat - wielder had apparently dropped his weapon in response to the billionaire ’ s verbally confronting him . local police said they could provide no information about what transpired , as the incident wasn ’ t reported to them : <PARA> the article also noted that this account followed a high - profile mugging of donald trump ’ s mother that had taken place a month earlier .
mixture	the stamp described in the example section above exists , although it is not new , it is not a “ christmas stamp ,” and it has nothing to do with president barack obama . <PARA> the eid stamp was a 2001 usps holiday series stamp commemorating two islamic holidays that have no connection to christmas . it was introduced by the united states postal service ( at the then - current 34 - cent rate ) as part of its holiday celebrations series on 1 september 2001 , just ten days before the september 11 terrorist attacks on new york and washington . it has since been reissued ( with varying background colors ) at updated first - class postage rates in 2002 , 2006 , 2007 , 2008 , 2009 , and as a forever stamp after 2011 . <PARA> as the usps describes the eid stamp : <PARA> the word “ eid ” is roughly equivalent to the english word “ celebration ” or “ festival .” the three - day eid al - fitr celebrates the end of the month - long fasting of ramadan ; the three - day eid al - adha commemorates the willingness of the prophet abraham to sacrifice his son ishmael in response to god ’ s command *, and it marks the end of hajj , the annual muslim pilgrimage to the holy city of mecca . ( in 2016 , eid al - fitr begins at sundown on july 6 , and eid al - adha commences at sundown on september 12 .) <PARA> the eid commemorative is often mischaracterized as a “ christmas stamp ,” but it has nothing to do with christmas other than that it is part of a series of u . s . postage stamps commemorating several diverse celebrations , some of which generally occur around the november - december “ holiday season ” timeframe ( christmas , hanukkah , kwanzaa , thanksgiving ), some of which occur at other times of year ( cinco de mayo ), and some of which move around from year to year relative to the gregorian calendar ( eid al - fitr and eid al - adha ). <PARA> the statement “[ muslims ] don ’ t even believe in christ and they ’ re getting their own christmas stamp !” is therefore nonsensical , akin to protesting hanukkah stamps because “ jews don ’ t even believe in christ but they have their own christmas stamp !” ( although muslims do not believe that jesus was the son of god , islam does regard him as a prophet , a mortal who was divinely chosen to spread god ’ s message .) <PARA> an august 2009 version of the “ muslim stamp ” e - mail added the claim that “ president obama has directed the united states postal service to remember and honor the eid muslim holiday season with a new commemorative 42 cent first class holiday postage stamp .” this statement is manifestly false : the eid stamp was introduced in 2001 , eight years before barack obama became president of the united states , and usps stamp designs are chosen by the citizens ’ stamp advisory committee ( csac ) and not by u . s . presidents . <PARA> the issue of “ boycotting ” a stamp that commemorates islamic holidays is largely moot , since eid stamps are generally a specialty item sold mostly to postal customers who specifically request them . moreover , the eid stamp is an ordinary first - class postage stamp ; all proceeds from its sale go to the usps , not to any muslim - related groups or organizations . <PARA> the eid stamp is also not the first or only governmental or commercial recognition of these islamic holidays in the u . s . the american greeting card manufacturer hallmark has produced a variety of holiday cards celebrating eid al - fitr , and president obama ’ s predecessor in the white house , president george w . bush , extended official greetings , issued messages , participated in commemorations of both eid al - fitr and eid al - adha ( even after the september 11 attacks ), and promoted the eid stamp via the white house web site . <PARA> variations : the following images have been circulated as pictures of the usps “ muslim ” stamp ( or as an “ arabic valentine ’ s day stamp ”), but neither depicts the eid stamp : the former is a non - usps custom stamp ordered through the zazzle web site , and the latter is one of the usps ’ s 2013 kaleidoscope flowers series : <PARA> (* this is the reverse of judeo - christian tradition , which holds that abraham was commanded by god to sacrifice not ishmael but his other son , isaac .)
false	on 12 july 2017 , the miami herald covered the death of former haitian official klaus eberwein , news that soon developed into an version of the “ clinton body count ” political urban legend . <PARA> in the original article , the herald reported that eberwein held the position of director general of haiti ’ s economic development agency ( fonds d ’ assistance économique et social , or faes ) from may 2012 until his replacement in february 2015 . according to the report , eberwein had subsequently struggled and worked as an uber driver , presumably to make ends meet : <PARA> the portion of the article that caught the attention of conspiracy blogs was about “ allegations of fraud and corruption ” faced by eberwein about faes ’ management of funds . the paper made no mention of clinton or the clinton foundation : <PARA> by 14 july 2017 , internet sleuths got wind of the news and , perhaps inevitably , built on it : <PARA> a separate blog post on the same day summarized the herald ‘ s report , then made an uncited and unsourced claim about eberwein ’ s scheduled appearance at a 18 july 2017 hearing : <PARA> the outlet originally reported that eberwein was slated to appear in relation to a probe into the management of petrocaribe funds , “ the money haiti receives from venezuela ’ s discounted oil program ”. we were unable to find a credible link to eberwein ’ s involvement in the hearing ; the same unsourced claim was repeated by a blog called the haiti sentinel . <PARA> however , many readers citing that site failed to recognize that the haiti sentinel article came after the other pieces , and that it based its claims upon them : <PARA> as it turns out , however , the article from yournewswire from which the haiti sentinel piece was written is suspect , containing a “ quote ” from eberwein — the only part of the article that linked him to the clintons to begin with — that was actually spoken by someone else : <PARA> someone did say that outside clinton foundation headquarters in manhattan in november 2016 , but yournewswire appears to have , for some reason , confused one person of haitian descent with another . the actual person who spoke this phrase is a community activist and new york area radio host named dahdoud andré , and this comment originally appeared in a bbc article : <PARA> andré , despite the attempts to stir suspicion , remains very much alive as of july 2017 , and pointed out to us that eberwein had nothing to do with any protests against the clintons that he had helped organize . ( it appears yournewswire took some liberties with the false quote as well , weaving donald trump ’ s assessment of the clinton foundation into andré ’ s .) <PARA> as we have noted before , allegations about hillary clinton , the clinton foundation , and corruption in haiti are not new , nor are they fully substantiated : <PARA> in 2014 , eberwein lamented slow progress in haiti following a 2010 earthquake , despite an outpouring of aid to the country , and claims about the clintons ’ influence in haiti are not limited to career clinton critics . in 2015 , politico reported : <PARA> the clintons ’ role in what was frequently framed as a bungled - at - best relief effort was described in a september 2016 slate piece : <PARA> the claim about eberwein ’ s purportedly suspicious suicide bore a strong resemblance to similar rumors involving former u . n . official john ashe in 2016 . ashe purportedly died before he could testify against clinton in the summer of that year . although insiders have repeatedly stated that ashe was never scheduled to testify against clinton , his name regularly appears on lists of those allegedly murdered by the clintons or their associates . <PARA> before news of klaus eberwein ’ s suicide was reported on 12 july 2017 , no reports said or even hinted that any probe in which he was involved targeted hillary clinton or the clinton foundation . the claim originated on the frequently disreputable yournewswire . com , and was uncritically repeated and amplified by readers and blogs . however , we have found no specific information tying eberwein to clinton before his july 2017 death . <PARA> we attempted to contact both the original herald writer as well as sen . evalière beauplan to verify the link or lack thereof , but have not yet received a response from either .
unproven	on 7 december 2016 , web site lifenews . com reported that anti - abortion groups had pressured retail chain macy ’ s into dropping its support for reproductive health organization planned parenthood : <PARA> lifenews . com appears to have sourced its claims to anti - abortion group 2ndvote rather than any firsthand information from macy ’ s . we attempted to independently confirm that macy ’ s had ever supported for planned parenthood , and turned up news items from a period in july 2015 when donald trump sent a tweet claiming macy ’ s funded planned parenthood : <PARA> in july 2015 , macy ’ s pulled trump ’ s merchandise from its stores over an unrelated controversy , releasing the following statement : <PARA> during the same time period , planned parenthood was making separate headlines over a series of undercover videos ( which have since been discredited ) captured in a “ sting ” perpetrated by an anti - abortion group . trump did not cite his claims that macy ’ s supported planned parenthood in the tweet , and we found nothing suggesting that the assertion was true . <PARA> one month later , an individual contacted several companies to ask whether they provided funds to planned parenthood . a statement from macy ’ s denied the claim : <PARA> we have contacted macy ’ s about the claim , but have not yet received a response . however , the december 2016 controversy would not be the first time that a company was erroneously accused of donating to planned parenthood . olive garden was falsely accused of donating to the organization in a similar social media frenzy ; the claims were false . the 2015 macy ’ s statement reproduced here suggests that the company does not and did not fund planned parenthood , and we could find no evidence to the contrary .
false	in early august 2018 social media users began sharing a quote ostensibly uttered by house minority leader nancy pelosi concerning a nonsensical connection between a national push to ban single - use plastic straws for environmental reasons , and gun control : “ the plastic straw ban is important for gun control . it stops pea shooting and spitballing which are gateway guns .” <PARA> although this statement was featured in a number of memes and facebook posts , it was never accompanied by any information about where and when pelosi supposedly made this pronouncement . the reason for this lack of evidence , of course , is that pelosi never actually said any such thing . <PARA> this quote did not originate with reporting by a credible news organization or a transcript of an interview , speech , or press conference . rather , it was manufactured in an attempt to paint pelosi as an foolish , crazy , or just plain out - of - touch politician . <PARA> we ’ ve encountered a number of fake quotes that were shared with similar intentions . these quotes rarely reflect politicians ’ actual words or beliefs ; instead , they ’ re intended to reinforce existing negative perceptions of those figures . these fabrications are often shared with clarifying statements opining that although the offered quote may be a fake , it “ might as well be real ” because it “ sounds like something [ that person ] would say ”:
false	many a college student has had to confront the dilemma of what to do when an instructor fails to show up for class but hasn ’ t informed anyone that class has been canceled . an instructor might be a few minutes late in arriving at the classroom for any number of reasons , so of course you wait — but for how long ? ten minutes ? fifteen minutes ? until the scheduled end of class ? it might be reasonable to give up and leave at 10 : 30 if no one has shown up to lead your 10 : 00 class , but what if the instructor strolls in at 10 : 40 and decides to give a pop quiz ( on which every student who failed to wait will get a zero )? <PARA> many students believe every college has regulations covering such circumstances , including detailed sets of rules that prescribe exactly how long students must wait based upon the academic “ rank ” ( i . e ., tenure and degree ) of the tardy instructor . surprisingly , although some schools do have an official “ wait ” rule , many institutions of higher learning have no official policies at all in this area , and we haven ’ t found any college with written regulations specifying different wait times based upon instructors ’ academic rankings , which is the disputed point of this “ everybody knows ” factoid and the item on which our ‘ false ’ designation rests . <PARA> a related legend about students turning the tables on a professor who fails to show up for a lecture can be found on our present tense page . it appears in two forms : an arrogant professor who leaves the day ’ s lecture on a cassette player , expecting students to stay to hear it , returns to find that his tape recorder is now talking to a roomful of other tape recorders with the students nowhere to be found , and a professor who chides a class for having left despite his hat being on the desk ( signifying he had been there earlier and would likely be coming right back ) next week arrives to find no students but a hat upon every desk . <PARA> variations : varying wait times ( generally between 10 and 20 minutes ) are usually assigned according to the rank of the instructor : the shortest wait times are for graduate assistants and the longest wait times are for tenured , doctorate - holding professors . mandatory wait times for classes led by instructors with other academic rankings ( e . g ., non - tenured faculty , instructors with master ’ s degrees , visiting professors ) fall somewhere in between the two .
unproven	nevada lawmakers have roundly criticized the u . s . department of energy after the agency revealed in court that they had secretly shipped one - half metric ton of radioactive plutonium into their state , confirming a journalist ’ s report in january 2019 , though federal officials deny the claim . <PARA> u . s . sen . catherine cortez masto of nevada , a democrat , said in a statement that she had put officials from the national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ) “ on notice ” about the secrecy . <PARA> “ the department of energy ( doe ) and nnsa negotiated in bad faith , hiding the timing of their shipment and refused to share crucial information with members of congress who had the security clearance to know ,” her statement read . <PARA> the u . s . government shipped around half a ton of the substance into nevada in november 2018 , a move first reported by journalist dan leone and confirmed in a court filing on 30 january 2019 by bruce diamond , the nnsa ’ s general counsel . <PARA> the weapons - grade plutonium was shipped into the state just before nevada state officials sued the doe in federal court in december 2018 looking to block the move in the first place . at the time , the nevada agency for nuclear projects executive director robert halstead said that the doe refused to share any information with the state , citing security reasons . <PARA> “ we ’ re going to be really pissed off if it turns out they snuck a shipment in here while they were engaged in what we thought were good faith negotiations ,” he said . <PARA> the revelation that the doe proceeded with the shipment to a site about 70 miles north of las vegas before the matter was brought to federal judge miranda du prompted state officials to double - down on opposing future waste shipments . du is currently considering the state ’ s request to block such a move in the first place . <PARA> “ i am beyond outraged by this completely unacceptable deception from the u . s . department of energy ,” gov . steve sisolak said in a statement . “ the [ doe ] led the state of nevada to believe that they were engaging in good - faith negotiations with us regarding a potential shipment of weapons - grade plutonium , only to reveal that those negotiations were a sham all along .” <PARA> the doe disputed accusations of impropriety in a statement , saying that it was “ inaccurate to state ” that lawmakers were not kept apprised of the shipment : <PARA> the nnsa had announced in november 2018 that texas or nevada was being considered as <PARA> an alternative “ staging point ” for the plutonium following a separate court ruling ordering the agency to remove it from a facility in south carolina . according to an nnsa report , the agency intended to use a location in each state as a temporary storage space until the material was taken to its final destination in new mexico . <PARA> cortez masto said that she “ put nnsa officials on notice ” regarding what she called a betrayal of trust on the part of the doe against nevadans , adding , “ i ’ m fighting alongside nevada ’ s congressional delegation , attorney general ford , and our governor to hold them accountable and to find out when this plutonium will be removed .” <PARA> it is unclear , however , what that effort could entail or whether the nevada legislature will take action of its own regarding the issue . we contacted both state senate majority leader kelvin atkinson and assembly speaker jason frierson seeking comment but did not hear back prior to publication .

false	a popular meme in march 2019 questioned why bill clinton had “ paid paula jones $ 850k to go away ” yet the fbi hadn ’ t raided his lawyer ’ s office . the meme was an obvious reference to two completely unrelated issues separated by decades : a 1994 lawsuit involving clinton and a search warrant executed by the fbi in april 2018 at the office of president donald trump ’ s attorney , michael cohen . <PARA> in short , the major differences in the cases referenced by the meme — one of which involved an fbi raid on a lawyer ’ s office and the other not — were as follows : clinton openly paid jones $ 850 , 000 to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit well after he became president and well after jones had had a chance to air her allegations to the public , press , and court system , while trump secretly used an intermediary to pay hush money to porn actress stormy daniels just ahead of a presidential election in order to keep her allegations that she had an affair with him from reaching the public and influencing the election results against him . <PARA> nothing clinton did in settling jones ’ civil lawsuit was illegal ( or even potentially illegal ), but trump ’ s payment of hush money to daniels through his lawyer was possibly an illegal act on the part of trump and / or cohen , hence the raid on the latter ’ s office but not the office of clinton ’ s lawyer . <PARA> on 6 may 1994 , jones , a former arkansas state employee , filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against clinton just days before the statute of limitations would have expired . in her lawsuit , she maintained that on 8 may 1991 , she was working the registration desk at excelsior hotel in little rock , arkansas , where the third annual governor ’ s quality management conference was being held , an event bill clinton ( then governor of arkansas ) attended to deliver a speech . jones alleged that an arkansas state trooper , danny ferguson , approached her at the registration desk , told her that clinton would like to meet with her , and escorted her to a business suite in the hotel where clinton was staying . <PARA> according to jones , once she entered clinton ’ s hotel suite he complimented her on her physical appearance , put his hand on her leg , attempted to kiss her on the neck , asked her if she was married , and finally lowered his trousers to expose his erect penis and asked jones to “ kiss it .” when jones rebuffed clinton ’ s advances , she said , he told her to “ keep this between ourselves ” and suggested that , in her words , he “ could damage her in her job and even jeopardize her employment .” <PARA> jones did not publicly discuss the incident until the american spectator referenced it in a january 1994 article , apparently based on information provided by trooper ferguson : <PARA> several months later , jones filed her lawsuit against clinton and ferguson , seeking a total of $ 750 , 000 in compensation for damages and attorneys ’ fees on counts of sexual harassment , intentional infliction of emotional distress , and defamation . the issue of whether jones could sue a sitting president went all the way to the u . s . supreme court , who upheld an appellate court decision that “ the president , like all other government officials , is subject to the same laws that apply to all other members of our society ,” and allowed jones ’ case to proceed . <PARA> however , judge susan webber wright of the u . s . district court for the eastern district of arkansas dismissed the lawsuit on 1 april 1998 , holding that “ the governor ’ s alleged conduct does not constitute sexual assault ,” that “ plaintiff ’ s allegations fall far short of the rigorous standards for establishing a claim of outrage under arkansas law ,” that “ plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that she has a case worthy of submitting to a jury ,” and that “ there are no genuine issues for trial in this case .” <PARA> when it came to light a few months later that clinton had lied under oath about his relationship with monica lewinsky during proceedings in jones ’ lawsuit , jones filed an appeal to reverse the dismissal and have her claims reinstated . on 13 november 1998 , clinton settled the matter by offering to pay jones $ 850 , 000 in exchange for her agreement to drop her appeal , without admitting to or apologizing for the conduct alleged by jones . <PARA> porn actress daniels ( the stage name of stephanie clifford ) said she first met trump at a celebrity golf tournament in nevada in july 2006 . the two engaged in sex in trump ’ s hotel room , she claimed , and continued an “ intimate relationship ” into the following year . daniels discussed her relationship with trump in a 2011 interview for in touch magazine , but the interview was not published at that time , reportedly because trump ’ s personal attorney , michael cohen , threatened to sue over it when the magazine reached out to ask for comment . <PARA> in january 2018 , the wall street journal reported that trump ’ s personal attorney , cohen , had arranged to pay daniels $ 130 , 000 just weeks before the 2016 u . s . presidential election in exchange for her signing a nondisclosure agreement related to her alleged 2006 affair with trump . <PARA> the following month , cohen confirmed that $ 130 , 000 had been paid to daniels , but he maintained that he had used his personal funds for the payment , and that “ neither the trump organization nor the trump campaign was a party to the transaction with ms . clifford , and neither reimbursed me for the payment , either directly or indirectly .” <PARA> on 5 april 2018 , trump denied to reporters that he knew about the payment to daniels . when pressed about why the payment had been made , trump replied , “ you ’ ll have to ask michael cohen ” and asserted he didn ’ t know where the $ 130 , 000 had come from . four days later , acting on a warrant from federal prosecutors in new york ’ s southern district obtained in part on a referral from special counsel robert mueller ’ s office , fbi agents seized a variety of material from cohen ’ s new york city office , home , and hotel room , including documents related to cohen ’ s payment to daniels and to karen mcdougal , another woman who had alleged an affair with trump . <PARA> a month later , former new york mayor rudy giuliani , now a member of trump ’ s legal team , said that trump had personally repaid cohen for the $ 130 , 000 payment to daniels , and that the reimbursement had been “ funneled through a law firm .” the following day , trump contradicted his earlier claim that he didn ’ t know about the payment by acknowledging that he had repaid cohen , but he asserted the money “ had nothing to do with the campaign .” <PARA> in august 2018 , cohen pleaded guilty to eight charges , including five counts of tax evasion , one count of making a false statement to a financial institution , one count of being a “ willful cause ” of an unlawful corporate contribution , and one count of making an excessive campaign contribution , the latter two stemming from the “ hush money ” payments made to daniels and mcdougal . prosecutors held that the payments made by cohen violated federal campaign finance laws because they were meant to benefit the campaign but did not come from campaign contributions and were not reported to the federal election commission ( fec ). the payments therefore constituted illegal in - kind contributions to the trump campaign that violated laws limiting such donations to $ 2 , 700 and requiring their disclosure to the fec . <PARA> whether trump himself could be charged with engaging in a criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws for his involvement in the hush money payments is still a matter of legal debate , but the issue took a dramatic turn in february 2019 when cohen revealed before congress that he was paid reimbursement for the hush money directly from trump ’ s personal bank account after trump became president . <PARA> “ cohen ’ s public testimony directly implicates trump in serious campaign finance violations ,” former fec general counsel lawrence noble told the washington post . “ assuming cohen is telling the truth about the purpose of the checks , the checks are documentary evidence supporting the allegation that trump had cohen pay daniels $ 135 , 000 in hush money and then reimbursed cohen .” <PARA> all in all , events proved the fbi had good reason to raid cohen ’ s office , as they gathered evidence of multiple federal crimes ( beyond just campaign finance violations ) to which cohen pleaded guilty . bill clinton ’ s payment to paula jones was a settlement of a civil lawsuit that did not involve any criminal matter or criminal wrongdoing , and thus it was of no legitimate interest to law enforcement . the only commonality between the two cases was that they involved payments by politicians to women , but for very different reasons and circumstances .
false	false <PARA> origins : on 13 june 2015 , the facebook page for american news (“ thepatriotreview ”) published a link to an article headlined “ breaking : federal court formally charges obama with treason ... this is it ” with an introduction stating that “ obama is formally being charged with treason .” <PARA> both the headline of the linked article and the comment appended to it strongly implied that president barack obama had been recently charged by federal authorities on treason charges . but the underlying article was dated 1 april 2015 , which ( irrespective of content ) made the “ breaking ” aspect of the story specious : it beggars belief that in the more than two months between 1 april 2015 and 13 june 2015 , not a single credible news outlets picked up on a story that would be a lead news item around the world . additional digging revealed that this very same claim was fronted by other sites back in june 2014 , making it almost exactly a year old at the time it resurfaced in american news . <PARA> aside from the highly questionable aspect of how a report this momentous could conceivably be “ breaking ” for a year , the “ formally charged ” claim — which suggests that a branch of government stepped in and independently charged president obama with treason — is highly dubious . and even the click - baiting american news didn ’ t go so far as to state that any such thing was the case : <PARA> if the name orly taitz sounds familiar , it ’ s because she ’ s been involved in a number of “ birther ” claims involving president obama that never bore fruit , including ones asserting that president obama stole his social security number and that taitz had uncovered a conspiracy surrounding the selection of attorney general nominee loretta lynch . <PARA> as far back as october 2009 , a federal judge in georgia sanctioned and fined taitz $ 20 , 000 for repeatedly filing frivolous motions found to be without merit : <PARA> the 2009 case ( rhodes v . mcdonald ) made mention of taitz ’ s use of the courts to promote an agenda and noted that she had earlier made accusations of treason against president obama : <PARA> the ruling in question explained that the courts were left with little choice but to sanction taitz and impose a fine due to her repeated misconduct as early as 2009 : <PARA> matching the claims of taitz and those of a number of unreliable web sites to an actual legal paper trail is difficult . however , during the june 2014 timeframe in which claims first circulated that obama had been “ formally charged ” with treason in a federal court , taitz appeared in at least two public legal records . one document was dated 13 june 2014 and pertained to a civil action ( not a criminal one , the type for which “ formally charged ” would be an accurate descriptor ) brought by taitz in united states district court in maryland . a second document dated 25 july 2014 ( a memorandum by ellen lipton hollander , united states district judge ) described taitz thusly : “[ b ] y way of background , plaintiff is a national leader in the so called ‘ birther ’ movement , whose mission is to establish that president obama is ineligible to serve as president of the united states because he was not born in the united states , as he claims .” <PARA> in judge lipton hollander ’ s memorandum ( prompted by orly taitz ’ s demand that hollander recuse herself from a case involving taitz ’ s claim that president obama had stolen the social security number of a man named harrison j . bounel ), she witheringly addressed taitz ’ s various challenges to the legal authority of both president obama and his various judicial appointees : <PARA> in summation , president obama was not “ formally charged with treason ” by any legal entity capable of bringing such charges in june 2014 , july 2014 , april 2015 , or june 2015 . the only legal action that blogs making such a claim referred to was a specious civil lawsuit brought by well - known “ birther ” crank orly taitz . <PARA> originally published : 15 june 2015
true	in june 2018 , longtime pittsburgh post - gazette cartoonist rob rogers was fired after a number of his drawings were rejected by the paper . shortly after the news broke , a tweet purportedly showing the cartoon that proved to be the final straw in rogers ’ relationship with the paper went viral : <PARA> the cartoon was created by rob rogers shortly before he lost his position at the pittsburgh post - gazette , but his firing was not based solely on this image but one of several anti - trump cartoons that was rejected by the paper shortly before he was let go . <PARA> rogers ’ cartoons have regularly appeared in the newspaper since he was first hired in 1993 . in 2018 , however , he noticed that more of his cartoons were being killed after a new editorial director joined the paper : <PARA> several of the drawings the paper rejected were critical of the president and his policies , but others dealt with issues not specifically tied to the president . for instance , rogers ’ cartoon mocking roseanne barr and her “ ambien ” excuse for making racist remarks was also rejected . rogers posted that cartoon , as well as many of his other spiked drawings , to his twitter page : <PARA> as rogers ’ work was repeatedly rejected by the paper , he announced on 6 june 2018 that he was taking a vacation as the editorial issues with his paper were resolved : <PARA> but rogers never returned to his position . on 14 june 2018 , he announced that he had been fired from his job : <PARA> the following day he published an op - ed in the new york times , saying that the political slant of his cartoons , which did not shy away from criticizing the trump administration and its various policies , played a large role in his termination : <PARA> editorial director keith burris said that rogers was fired because he was unwilling to “ collaborate ” on his cartoons : <PARA> john block — publisher of the pittsburgh post - gazette — was more blunt about the decision , saying that rogers “ hasn ’ t been funny in a long time ”: <PARA> on 3 june 2018 , rogers posted this comic featuring president trump :
mixture	two of donald trump ’ s most prominent 2016 campaign pledges were to build a border wall along the mexican border ( or rather , to reinforce and extend it ; a wall already exists along hundreds of miles of the international border ), and to renegotiate the north american free trade agreement , a 1994 arrangement between the united states , canada and mexico which he called “ the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country .” <PARA> in october 2017 , left - wing facebook page “ the other 98 %” posted a widely - shared meme which claimed that mexico had — in retaliation for trump ’ s border wall plans — signed a major agricultural trade agreement with argentina , which would have very harmful effects on american farmers : <PARA> as of 1 november 2017 , mexico and argentina have not signed an agreement like the one described by “ the other 98 %”, but the two countries have held talks about a more limited ( though still significant ) trade deal involving grains and cars . furthermore , the main catalyst for the negotiations has been the uncertainty caused by donald trump ’ s vow to renegotiate nafta rather than his plans to build a border wall . <PARA> the source cited by “ the other 98 %” is a september 2017 article by daily kos , which reported : <PARA> it ’ s not clear what the source of these claims is , but a similar meme appeared online earlier in 2017 , which read : <PARA> “ made in america week ” took place from 17 - 24 july 2017 ; we found no evidence of any deal between mexico and argentina being announced during that time period . however , talks have been ongoing between the two countries . <PARA> in the spring of 2017 , mexico ’ s deputy economy minister juan carlos baker made several comments in interviews about his country ’ s negotiations with argentina and brazil . on 26 march 2017 , the financial times reported : <PARA> the following month , baker told reuters that a deal with argentina could be finalized by the end of 2017 : <PARA> a trade deal between mexico and argentina may be in the works , but it has not yet been announced as of 1 november 2017 . however , assuming a deal goes ahead to shift mexico ’ s importation of certain products from the united states to argentina , the numbers are significant — but not as dramatic as they are in the meme . <PARA> according to united states grain council statistics , the united states exported $ 2 . 5 billion worth of corn to mexico in 2015 and 2016 . in 2015 , the united states exported $ 2 . 9 billion worth of soy products to mexico , according to the u . s . soybean export council ( page 19 .) according to global agricultural trade system statistics for 2016 , exports of wheat and rice were worth $ 612 million and $ 274 million , respectively . <PARA> this yields a total of $ 6 . 3 billion in u . s . exports to mexico of corn , rice , wheat and soy — the four products specified in the above meme . so even if mexico did decide to stop importing all these products from the u . s ., the likely annual financial cost to the american agriculture industry would be extremely significant , but still only around half the $ 13 billion claimed . <PARA> it ’ s not entirely clear where the figure of $ 13 billion came from , but it might have originated in an october 2017 letter sent to commerce secretary wilbur ross , and signed by dozens of food and agriculture companies and industry associations , warning ross about the dangers , as they see them , of withdrawing from nafta . <PARA> the study mentioned here was an august 2017 working paper produced by the economic consulting firm impactecon . it did not actually mention any figure of $ 13 billion . rather , it projected that over the course of two to three years after a u . s . withdrawal from nafta , real gdp in the united states would fall by as much as 0 . 09 percent . <PARA> gross domestic product , or gdp , is the combined market value of all goods and services produced in a particular geographic area ( in this case , the united states .) it is a calculation commonly used to measure the total size of an economy . real gdp is gross domestic product adjusted for inflation – meaning , roughly speaking , the size of the economy in relation to the cost of living . <PARA> as of the third quarter of 2017 ( when the impactecon report was published ), the real gdp of the united states was $ 17 . 01 trillion , according to figures from the bureau of economic analysis . a 0 . 09 percent decline in that would amount to a $ 15 . 3 billion loss — not far off the $ 13 billion posited by the food and agriculture industry , in their letter . <PARA> there are a couple of things to note here : firstly , the 0 . 09 percent decline estimated in the impactecon report relates to the entire u . s . economy , and not “ the farm sector alone ,” as mentioned in the letter . <PARA> in fact , the working paper projects a very small increase in production for the crops and forestry sector ( 0 . 04 percent , page 20 ), accompanied by a significant boost to production in the sugar sector ( 5 . 11 percent ), but it also projects production declines of between one and two percent in the meat , food and livestock and fishing sectors . <PARA> secondly , this real gdp declined is projected to happen “ in the next 2 - 3 years ”, so if the meme is using the letter to wilbur ross as the source of its $ 13 billion figure , it is misrepresenting the decline as happening “ annually .”
mixture	prior to the passage of the american health care act in the u . s . house of representatives on 4 may 2017 , critics warned that the bill would specifically put sexual assault and rape survivors at risk because it would list their circumstances as being “ pre - existing conditions ” subject to either price gouging or disqualification from healthcare insurance providers . <PARA> after it was passed , those concerns only increased . jodi omear , a spokesperson for the rape , abuse & incest national network survivor advocacy group released a statement : <PARA> neither sexual assault nor rape were named in the legislation , which critics have dubbed “ trumpcare .” the concern stemmed in part from an amendment to the bill , which allows states to apply for waivers on an aca mandate requiring insurers to provide coverage for several “ essential ” services . <PARA> author and freelance journalist linda tirado called the concern on the part of sexual assault victims a “ visceral fear ;” in a string of tweets after the bill passed , tirado related an encounter with a woman who told her she had been raped but did not report it and was concerned about the potential effect on her health care : <PARA> the amendment was crafted by rep . mark meadows ( r - north carolina ) and rep . tom macarthur ( r - new jersey ). attempts to reach their respective washington d . c . offices following the bill ’ s passage were unsuccessful . <PARA> a spokesperson for the health insurer trade group america ’ s health insurance plans , kristine grow , told us : <PARA> the latter document grow named was created in 1999 by the national association of insurance commissioners , and prohibits “ unfair discrimination by health carriers and insurance professionals on the basis of abuse status .” by february 2014 , a majority of states had enacted provisions similar to the naic ’ s legislation . for example , florida law says : <PARA> as of may 2017 , 42 states had enacted provisions similar to those described naic model acts while another six ( kansas , mississippi , nebraska , new mexico , rhode island , and tennessee ) had outright adopted an naic model . tirado told us the debate over whether the ahca would turn rape into a pre - existing condition is a “ linguistic ” one : <PARA> a 2009 huffington post report found evidence that rape victims were , indeed , being denied coverage in the wake of their assault : <PARA> at the time , a different ahip spokesperson said that insurers ordinarily would not know if an applicant had been sexually assaulted , but that if someone developed post - traumatic stress disorder in the wake of an attack , it “ could be a factor ” in their being denied coverage .
false	origins : neither the fcc nor congress is considering — much less voting on — legislation that would impose ( or allow phone companies to impose ) per - minute access fees on internet users . recent decisions by the fcc in this area have dealt only with the issue of how phone companies reimburse each other for handling calls placed to internet service providers , not with the prospect of allowing phone companies to charge their customers long - distance rates for internet use . <PARA> as soon as we get hold of something we really like at a reasonable price , we start worrying that it will be banned , taxed , or made too expensive for us to afford . the internet is no exception , as our old friend — the capitalized , exclamation pointed , “ send this to everyone you know ” anonymous e - mail message — is here to tell you . <PARA> way back when in 1987 , the federal communications commission did consider imposing a surcharge for transmitting data over the public telephone network , but they ultimately rejected the idea ( thanks in part to the more than 10 , 000 letters of complaint they received ). unable to believe our good fortune ( the government wasn ’ t going to make us pay through the nose for dialing up all those neat computer bulletin boards we ’ d discovered ), we couldn ’ t leave well enough alone , and in 1991 a flood of urgent messages warning us that the fcc was again considering a proposal they ’ d rejected three years earlier hit e - mail systems all over the country ( and the nascently popular internet ). like the ubiquitous craig shergold message , the “ modem tax ” warning would long outlive the validity of the information it conveyed . <PARA> fast forward to 1998 . on - line services , the internet , the world wide web , e - mail , and chat rooms are more popular than ever , a daily part of many people ’ s lives . somebody — the government , the phone companies , bill gates , the grinch — must be on his way to spoil the party . sure enough , we ’ re now being told the phone companies and the government are in cahoots to ruin our good <PARA> time . <PARA> first of all , a little background . most of us still have to dial up over a modem and connect to an internet service provider ( isp ) to access the internet . if your isp is in your local dialing area , you probably don ’ t pay anything at all for the call , no matter how long you stay connected . this means you get to tie up a phone line with your modem for hours and hours on end , every day , at no charge beyond the price of basic phone service . and the party at the other end of the line — your isp — isn ’ t paying anything extra , either . it ’ s easy to see that somebody has a chance to reap some windfall profits here . if the phone companies were allowed to charge you a per - minute fee for accessing the internet ( or the government were allowed to tax your use of the internet ), their coffers would soon overflow with cash . <PARA> scary thought , isn ’ t it ? all the phone companies need , we hear , is to get the fcc to reclassify and / or regulate isps , and then the phone companies can charge gobs of extra money for handling internet traffic . and congress is just about to vote on that very issue , we ’ re told . <PARA> in fact , there is no such proposal before congress , and there never has been . <PARA> the only real issue before the fcc concerning internet usage ( and the genesis of this latest round of scaremongering ) is the subject of “ reciprocal compensation .” in short , reciprocal compensation means that when you place a local call to someone who is serviced by a different phone company , your phone company has to compensate his phone company for completing the call . ( on the other hand , when you place a long - distance call , the long distance carrier who handles the traffic has to pay access charges to your phone company for originating the call .) but if the “ person ” you ’ re calling is an isp , should your phone company have to compensate the isp ’ s phone company ? <PARA> the subject of reciprocal compensation has been a hot issue of late because new local phone companies have been springing up all over the place . the bigger phone companies , figuring that they would have many more customers than their newer ( and smaller ) competitors , negotiated reciprocal compensation agreements with the new phone companies . every time one of these little phone companies ’ customers placed a call to a destination outside his local service that ended up on the bigger phone company ’ s network , the big phone company would get to collect money from the little phone company . not a bad scheme , the big phone companies thought . <PARA> ah , but some of the little guys had a neat trick up their sleeves . they started offering their services to internet service providers — isps with banks and banks of modems that received thousands and thousands of calls every day , but never made any outgoing calls . all the reciprocal compensation started flowing one direction , from the big phone companies to the little phone companies , which wasn ’ t what the big guys had in mind at all . “ foul ,” they cried . “ internet traffic flows all over the world ,” they noted . “ internet traffic is therefore interstate in nature and should be classified as long - distance , so the little guys should be paying us for originating the calls ,” they insisted . “ we ’ re not paying ,” they sputtered . <PARA> enter the fcc to resolve the dispute , which they did ( for now ) on 25 february 1999 by ruling that phone companies are bound by whatever reciprocal compensation agreements they ’ ve negotiated with each other , whether they think they ’ re fair or not . that was the only issue before the fcc . but most of us are already struggling with a glut of information , and we don ’ t have the time to familiarize ourselves with details like interconnection agreements and reciprocal compensation , so when we hear reports with buzzwords like “ internet ,” “ fcc ,” “ access fees ,” and “ long distance ,” we assume the worst , even though the real story is something quite different . and even if we make the effort to understand the whole story , we find all too often that we ’ re reading information that has been misreported by others — often the mainstream media — who didn ’ t make enough of an effort to understand the whole story themselves . if we can ’ t even depend upon the people whose business it is to supply us with accurate information to get the facts straight , what more can we do ?

false	a contentious 8 november 2016 election ( and its results ) led to a cottage industry of preying on hopes that a pre - inauguration upset was going to take place . one instance of this came from bipartisan report , which published a 6 december 2016 headline claiming that the swing state of florida was moving for a “ full recount ” because of purported voting irregularities : <PARA> the article was primed to move on facebook and twitter , but its content did not quite match its headline . bipartisan report cited the detroit free press , but that source material did not support the claim that florida sought a recount . that article reported that three voters filed a suit likely to have no effects on the state ’ s certification process ( according to the attorney for the plaintiffs ): <PARA> the claim that florida uncovered massive voter fraud or moved to recount any of the ballots in 2016 was false . additionally , the 12 december 2016 “ safe - harbor deadline ” in florida came and went with no movement on the part of election officials to either recount ballots or contest the results in that state .

false	all over facebook and youtube is the announcement that the muslim call to prayer will be broadcast every friday . this seems strange to me , as the call to prayer is usually broadcast 5 times a day in countries with a predominantly muslim population . <PARA> origins : on 14 january 2015 , christian evangelist franklin graham ( son of billy graham ) published the above - referenced <PARA> status update to his facebook page . graham urged his followers to condemn duke university due to a newly - instituted weekly call to prayer for its muslim students . <PARA> graham ’ s plea rapidly began to circulate and prompt outcry due in part to its timing : earlier in january 2015 , twelve employees of the french satirical publication charlie hebdo were massacred at their workplace by suspected sympathizers of islamic state . duke ’ s timing was not coincidental , either : in a 14 january 2015 commentary about the decision , associate dean for religious life at duke university chapel in durham christy lorr sapp explained the move was aimed at promoting inclusion on campus in light of an increased level of hostility toward muslims : <PARA> with the recent attacks in paris and pakistan and renewed conflict in nigeria , there is much negative press focused on parts of the muslim world . from isis to boko haram to al - qaida , muslims in the media are portrayed as angry aggressors driven by values that are anti - education and anti - western . <PARA> yet , at duke university , the muslim community represents a strikingly different face of islam than is seen on the nightly news : one that is peaceful and prayerful . this face of the faith will be given more of a voice as the duke muslim community begins chanting the adhan , the call to prayer , from the duke chapel bell tower on fridays beginning this week . it will be chanted by muslim students prior to the jummah prayer service that takes place in the chapel basement each friday afternoon . <PARA> this opportunity represents a larger commitment to religious pluralism that is at the heart of duke ’ s mission and connects the university to national trends in religious accommodation . <PARA> perhaps , too , this small token of welcome will provide a platform for a truer voice to resonate : a voice that challenges media stereotypes of muslims , a voice of wisdom , a voice prayer and a voice of peace . <PARA> yet , at duke university , the muslim community represents a strikingly different face of islam than is seen on the nightly news : one that is peaceful and prayerful . this face of the faith will be given more of a voice as the duke muslim community begins chanting the adhan , the call to prayer , from the duke chapel bell tower on fridays beginning this week . it will be chanted by muslim students prior to the jummah prayer service that takes place in the chapel basement each friday afternoon . <PARA> this opportunity represents a larger commitment to religious pluralism that is at the heart of duke ’ s mission and connects the university to national trends in religious accommodation . <PARA> perhaps , too , this small token of welcome will provide a platform for a truer voice to resonate : a voice that challenges media stereotypes of muslims , a voice of wisdom , a voice prayer and a voice of peace . <PARA> driving the outrage in part was a general sentiment duke university is a historically christian institution . however , the level to which duke is so considered has been a subject of debate and dispute in previous controversies . in 2010 , duke ’ s vice president for public affairs and government relations described the university as an “ independent and non - sectarian institution ,” and said “ its ties to the church are primarily historical and symbolic .” the dean of the chapel concurred and “ characterized the relationship between duke and the church as ‘ benign and benevolent .'” <PARA> many of those posting angry comments to duke university ’ s facebook wall labored under the impression the institution was favoring muslim traditions at the expense christian ones . that claim is not true : duke ’ s chapel calendar revealed that during the week in which the initial muslim call to prayer was announced , a number of denominational services were scheduled . among them were no fewer than seven catholic masses ( three on sunday ), several adult bible study meetings , christian sunday school , an event called “ godly play ” for young children , and “ midweek prayer .” a mission statement on the duke chapel ’ s site explains : <PARA> duke chapel continues to be a christian church of uniquely interdenominational character and purpose . through its tradition of inspiring worship and music , and a calling to walk with people of all faiths and circumstances , duke chapel acts a beacon of grace on campus and in the community . all are welcome to take part in worship , learning , dialogue , and service . <PARA> however , shortly afterwards duke decided to reverse the previously announced policy due to public criticism : <PARA> in the face of biting criticism from conservative christian evangelist franklin graham , duke university [ has ] dropped its plan to let muslim students chant a weekly call to prayer from the duke chapel bell tower . <PARA> “ duke remains committed to fostering an inclusive , tolerant and welcoming campus for all of its students ,” michael schoenfeld , vice president for public affairs , said in a news release . “ however , it was clear that what was conceived as an effort to unify was not having the intended effect .” <PARA> “ duke remains committed to fostering an inclusive , tolerant and welcoming campus for all of its students ,” michael schoenfeld , vice president for public affairs , said in a news release . “ however , it was clear that what was conceived as an effort to unify was not having the intended effect .”
mixture	origins : the issue over whether states should recognize same - sex marriages or allow for civil unions that extend same - sex couples the same benefits and rights as married male - female couples remains controversial . vermont recently implemented the nation ’ s first civil union system to provide the equivalent rights and benefits of heterosexual marriage to same - sex couples , and five other state legislatures ( rhode island , connecticut , washington , hawaii , and california ) have considered similar measures . in response , thirty - five other states ( and the federal government ) have adopted “ defense of marriage laws ” to define marriage specifically as a union between a man and a woman . in july 2001 , the group alliance for marriage began to promote the passage of a federal marriage amendment to legislate that “ marriage in the united states shall consist only of the union of a man and a woman ,” an action that — if successful — could effectively prevent or overturn state laws recognizing same - sex marriages and civil unions . the petition linked above seeks to enlist support to prevent this from happening . <PARA> in order to become part of the constitution , an amendment must : <PARA> the federal marriage amendment was finally introduced on 15 may 2002 , but the claim that it is being “ pushed through congress ” is somewhat misleading , as it implies that the amendment is being sneaked past unaware congressman or is likely to be passed due to the strong - arming efforts of its supporters . it hasn ’ t even come up for a vote yet ( and indeed , it may never be voted upon ), and fox news noted that the “ amendment has little chance of becoming the law of the land merely because of the obstacles a measure must overcome to change the constitution .” ( since most democrats would presumably vote against such an amendment , and the composition of both the house and the senate is close to 50 - 50 , the chances of a two - thirds majority in both houses are rather slim .) <PARA> consider the following : <PARA> what ’ s the significance of all this ? politicians shy away from passing important laws like consitutional amendments that could cost them votes and deny them re - election . that ’ s why all the successful amendments in the last eight decades have dealt with the technicalities of holding office or laws affecting who can vote — politicians ’ passing amendments to govern themselves is politically safe , and politicians ’ allowing more people to vote generally garners them the support of the voters they just enfranchised . but for a long time time now , constitutional amendments involving social issues — even one as comparatively innocuous as the equal rights amendment — have been too controversial for comfort . <PARA> the bottom line is that it ’ s a very long way from “ some group wants to pass a constitutional amendment ” to actually amending the constitution , and the proposal discussed here isn ’ t even within sight of the finish line . dedicated efforts are indeed being made by both those who would like to pass this amendment and those who would like to defeat it , however , so citizens who feel strongly about the issue should certainly contact their representatives to make their views known .
unproven	on 3 june 2018 , a twitter user relayed a story about an asthmatic child who purportedly died when his parents substituted unspecified essential oils for asthma medications : <PARA> screenshots of the tweet circulated independently on other social media platforms , such as facebook and reddit ( multiple times .) the twitter user who first shared the claim regularly tweets about purported interactions and incidents in an unidentified emergency room . <PARA> others commented on the tweet asking for corroborating information , sometimes suggesting that if a child died in the described manner that the incident would be at least locally newsworthy : <PARA> although the story proved popular , the author did not respond to requests for additional information , whether from media outlets or users looking for the article referenced in the tweet . they did not provide a specific location or any back story , although earlier tweets indicated that the poster might live or work in the atlanta area . previous twitter - related tales of hospital horrors have gone similarly unverified ( likely due at least in part to privacy laws .) a 2015 blog post written by a physician tackled the same topic , but his post did not mention any deaths . <PARA> it is possible that the claim was accurate as relayed , but it is just as possible that the story was fabricated as a warning against the use of essential oils in lieu of medically necessary interventions .
unproven	news broke on jan . 7 , 2020 , that nick sandmann , the teen at the center of a 2019 misinformation - fueled internet controversy , had settled with cnn after suing the cable station for defamation to the tune of $ 275 million . <PARA> although it ’ s true that cnn settled with sandmann , who had sought $ 275 million in damages , the details of the settlement were not made public . we sent questions to sandmann ’ s attorney and cnn asking for clarification on any potential damages to be paid out to the teen but received no response from either . <PARA> though some cast the settlement with cnn as a victory for sandmann , cnn reported that the settlement , “ will allow cnn to avoid a lengthy and potentially unpredictable trial . sandmann sought $ 275 million in damages in the lawsuit he filed against cnn last march .” <PARA> some on social media stated that sandmann had “ won ” his lawsuit against cnn , while others claimed that cnn will pay $ 275 million to sandmann , a detail that isn ’ t known to anyone except , most likely , the sandmann family and the legal representatives for sandmann and cnn . here is an example of one such tweet , with the user ’ s name cropped out for privacy : <PARA> the lawsuit stems from a jan . 18 , 2019 , incident at the lincoln memorial in washington , d . c ., in which students from covington catholic high school in kentucky , many of whom were wearing red make america great again ( maga ) caps , were in the process of leaving an anti - abortion rally they had attended . as they were doing so , they walked into an incendiary brew that included a group of black nationalists , who could be heard on video shouting insults at the boys , and attendees from an indigenous rights rally , who were also in the process of leaving . <PARA> a native american activist from the indigenous rights rally , nathan phillips , said afterwards it appeared to him that the dynamic between the covington kids and black nationalists was getting tense , so he intervened to pray . phillips approached teens while percussing a drum and singing a native american song . he ended up standing face - to - face with sandmann and what transpired next saturated the national news cycle . <PARA> the outrage was driven at first by a tweet containing a brief video that misleadingly appeared to show a smirking sandmann and the other students surrounding phillips and blocking his path . outrage ensued , and the image rocketed across the web with many reacting to the image by stating it depicted racism exhibited by sandmann and the other maga hat - wearing students . twitter later suspended the account that posted the tweet . <PARA> but after the initial video drew national anger that resulted in death threats directed at sandmann , more footage containing additional context emerged , and statements made by sandmann indicated that phillips had approached sandmann , and that sandmann was backed into a group of other students and didn ’ t have much space to move out of the way . sandmann stated he was not smirking but smiling to indicate that he didn ’ t pose a threat , and that he was surprised and confused to find himself in the predicament . <PARA> aside from cnn , sandmann also sued nbc and the washington post , in cases that are still underway .
true	origins : due to its strange appearance and the fact that it resides behind locked gates on private property <PARA> ( the fly ranch in hualapai flat ), the fly geyser in nevada is often met with a mixture of awe and skepticism when viewers encounter photographs of that strange formation on the internet . that geothermal vent in the black rock desert really does exist and look as pictured , but some misconceptions about it abound . <PARA> first , the fly geyser is not a natural formation . it ’ s a man - made geyser created by accident in 1964 when an explorative well drilled in the area was either left uncapped or not capped properly , causing dissolved minerals to accumulate and rise and thus create the limestone mound ( which continues to grow ) that houses the geyser . <PARA> second , the vibrant colors of the fly geyser seen in photographs are not the product of digital manipulation . according to weather . com , the brilliant red and greens featured on the geyser come from thermophilic algae : <PARA> the fly geyser is not a natural formation . the geyser was created accidentally in 1964 , after a geothermal power company drilled a test well at the site . while the groundwater in the region turned out not to be sufficiently hot to be tapped for geothermal power , it did have a temperature of more than 200 degrees . according to later newspaper reports , the well was either left uncapped or was improperly plugged . <PARA> the scalding water has erupted from the well since then , leaving calcium carbonate deposits growing at the rate of several inches per year . the brilliant red and green coloring on the mounds is from thermophilic algae thriving in the extreme micro - climate of the geysers . <PARA> additionally , many images of the colorful formation make it appear that the fly geyser is quite large , but this is not the case . the peculiar site in the nevada desert is only about five feet tall and twelve feet wide . <PARA> the size of the fly geyser is changing , however , as noted in the book nevada curiosities : quirky characters , roadside oddities & other offbeat stuff : <PARA> at first glance , fly geyser , located on the edge of the black rock desert , about two hours north of reno , is a spectacular sight as it spews clouds of hot water about 4 or 5 feet high in the air . and the whole thing is the result of an accident . the gesyer was actually created in 1964 after a geothermal power company drilled a test well at the site . according to newspaper reports , the well either was left uncapped or was improperly plugged . as a result , the scalding hot water was allowed to blast uncontrolled from the well hole , and calcium carbonate deposits began to form , growing several inches each year . now , after a few decades , those deposits have become large mounds taller than an average - size man . <PARA> although the fly geyser is certainly a fascinating sight , not many people have had the chance to gaze upon its colorful beauty in person . blackrockdesert . org notes that the man - made formation sits within the boundaries of private property : <PARA> fly geyser is one of the most beautiful sights in nevada . adjacent to the black rock desert playa , in neighboring hualapai valley , fly geyser is on private property . <PARA> please do not trespass . the friends of black rock receives hundreds of inquiries each year to visit the site . it is our hope that one day , the geyser can once again be open to the public .
mixture	on 4 march 2016 , entertainment gossip web site tmz reported that the los angeles police department was conducting an investigation based on the recent acquisition of a knife possibly linked to the 1994 murder of o . j . simpson ’ s ex - wife nicole brown simpson and her friend ron lyle goldman . o . j . simpson was famously acquitted of all charges , and the case remains unsolved . <PARA> the chain of events originally reported by tmz prompted nearly as much incredulity as the simpson knife claim itself . according to the article , a knife was discovered at some point between 1998 and approximately 2006 ( the murders occurred in 1994 ): <PARA> not long after tmz broke the story , the los angeles times looked into what was originally described as a “ top secret investigation ,” reporting that a knife apparently was recovered on the property at some point : <PARA> los angeles outlet knbc interviewed los angeles police captain andrew neiman , who expressed skepticism at the chain of events leading up to the purported discovery of the knife : <PARA> while it ’ s true the los angeles police department is investigating a knife reportedly found on the grounds of what was once o . j . simpson ’ s brentwood home , the circumstances under which the knife emerged remains questionable . as yet , there is no evidence that the knife was linked to the murders . <PARA> finally , the timing of the revelation ( in close proximity to renewed interest due to the airing of the miniseries the people vs . o . j . simpson ) made such a coincidental finding further suspect . <PARA> on 1 april 2016 , the los angeles times reported that the knife had nothing to do with the o . j . simpson case :
false	discussion of the cancer - fighting properties of a chemical ( variously referred to as amygdalin , laetrile , or “ vitamin b17 ”) has been a fixture of the so - called alternative medicine movement for decades . despite an exhaustive body of research demonstrating that its use is both ineffective and potentially dangerous , these claims still make their way onto the internet ’ s most popular “ natural health ” blogs and continue to fuel anti - government conspiracies . <PARA> the story of “ b17 deficiency ” has the two key qualities of a classic snake oil campaign : a simple , easy cure for all cancer provided by mother nature herself , and a purported widespread conspiracy to prevent the public from knowing about it . <PARA> this string of loosely connected words from a viral september 2016 post is representative of the way this issue is frequently framed : <PARA> before digging into this reassuring bit of nonsense , we have to be clear on one key point : the notion of “ vitamin b17 ” was essentially made up by a man named ernst krebs , jr ., inventor of a partially synthetic chemical called laetrile that was at one point rebranded as a vitamin in an effort to get around fda new drug regulations . no official pharmacopoeia lists it as a vitamin , and it does not possess any of the required characteristics of a vitamin . <PARA> in a hearing about an 1976 injunction demanding that a company cease selling supplements with this compound , a federal court described the vitamin defense as “ a patently absurd and transparent attempt to avoid the drug labeling provisions of the federal food , drug , and cosmetic act .” <PARA> amygdalin is a naturally occurring compound that can be found in a variety of foods , most notably bitter almonds and the pits of apricots and other fruits . claims that it is a potential cancer therapy can be credited to the father and son team of ernst krebs sr . ( a doctor and pharmacist with a long history of promoting fringe folk remedies ) and ernst krebs jr . ( who was not a doctor nor even the recipient of any degree in science , save an honorary doctorate from a now - defunct university ). their work is described in a 1981 review on the topic : <PARA> one of the tell - tale warning signs of a pseudoscientific remedy is that the explanation for how it works ( or even what it does , and in this case even what it is ) changes every time someone points out that a previous explanation was demonstrably unworkable , without acknowledgement of the previous lack of veracity . <PARA> there have been at least four explanations for why laetrile might work . as summarized by a national institutes of health physician data query report , most invoke the fact that laetrile is toxic to cancer cells ( which is almost certainly related to the fact that it metabolizes into cyanide ) but not other cells : <PARA> in fact , the rationale for laetrile ’ s efficacy is not the only thing that has shifted over the course of its promotion ; what conditions or health problems it is meant to ameliorate have also jumped around , as discussed in a 1977 fda report : <PARA> the definition of what chemically constitutes both laetrile and “ vitamin b17 ” has been equally fluid . though classically defined by krebs jr . as a specific compound named “ laevo - mandelonitrile - beta - glucuronoside ,” numerous tests have shown that this product is not what is found in most laetrile or b17 products . <PARA> in many studies , amygdalin and laevo - mandelonitrile - beta - glucuronoside are taken to be the same thing , despite the fact that they are not ( recall that the reason a “ synthetic version ” of amygdalin was needed was rooted in kreb sr .’ s conclusion that the natural version was too toxic for human use ). other claims suggest an even broader definition , which includes an entire class of structurally related compounds variously named nitrilosides or laetrile . <PARA> overshadowing this unceasing onslaught quacktastic red flags are two hard truths : 1 ) there is effectively no evidence that laetrile , amygdalin , b17 , etc ., have any efficacy as a cancer treatment for humans and 2 ) there is plenty of evidence to suggest that amygdalin and related compounds are extremely toxic to humans , a problem compounded by the fact that several studies have shown that amygdalin supplements vary wildly in the accuracy of their concentrations and are completely unregulated . <PARA> in response to pressure from pro - laetrile groups during its heyday in the 1970s , the national cancer institute conducted a retrospective review , published in 1976 of people who had been treated with laetrile for cancer . they did this by soliciting information by mail from 385 , 000 physicians and 70 , 000 other health professionals known to treat patients with laetrile , as well as by soliciting information directly from members of pro - laetrile groups . <PARA> of the 70 , 000 cases estimated to have been treated with the chemical at the time , only 93 were submitted for review . a further 26 were eliminated due to insufficient data , revealing , ultimately , only six that could be described as “ producing a response ”: <PARA> in a followup to this report , a 1982 human trial that treated 78 cancer patients with amygdalin , published the new england journal of medicine , concluded : <PARA> a 2015 review of over 200 citations related to amygdalin , laetrile , and cancer concluded : <PARA> these results are not to say that amygdalin and related compounds do not do anything . in that same 1982 human trial , researchers documented both the aforementioned lack of efficacy , as well its potentially fatal toxicity : <PARA> this , too , was echoed in the previously cited 2015 evidence review , which stated : <PARA> the weight of this evidence has not deterred natural health evangelists like joseph mercola ( who was recently ordered by the ftc to pay back over five million dollars in money generated from selling his own brand of indoor tanning beds that , in his words , “ slash your risk of cancer ”) from suggesting that the weight of scientific evidence is on their side . <PARA> mercola , in a 2014 post that appears on many other websites , lists five studies which he says demonstrates the effectiveness of laetrile . none of these studies were based on human trials or data generated by the compound ’ s actual clinical use ( unlike the large scale clinical trials and retrospective reviews and meta - reviews mentioned above ); they were either cell line studies or studies based on laboratory animals . <PARA> that promotion of “ vitamin b17 ” is still a viable business model online is thanks , in large part , to the efforts of individuals with political or financial motives , but whose medical background might best be described as non - existent . <PARA> that movement got a huge lift in 1973 when a public relations officer at sloan kettering hospital , which was given the task by the nih of performing a series of laetrile trials , alleged a cover up of , and leaked , data that claimed potential for laetrile as an anti - cancer agent . despite the fact that no scientist could reproduce those results in a series of followups , the view of a government cover - up created a media sensation , and has left a mark on its research that still resonates today . <PARA> that former public relations writer , dr . ralph w . moss ( who has a ph . d in classics , not science ) is now one of the leading advocates for laetrile . for the low price of $ 297 . 00 , he will provide you with a personalized “ moss report ” about your cancer diagnosis . he even provides one hour phone consultations to discuss treatment options . the legally required disclaimer on his website reads “ nothing ralph w . moss , phd , says in your telephone consultation constitutes medical advice .” <PARA> perhaps the most prominent force keeping the laetrile myth alive is the book “ world without cancer : the story of vitamin b17 ” ( which was very positively reviewed by “ dr .” ernst krebs jr himself !) by g . edward griffith , a libertarian activist with no medical training . despite his book being basis for many pro - laetrile arguments , griffith himself seems to be less enthused by that notion these days , as evidenced by this fairly convoluted introduction on his web site vitaminb17 . org : <PARA> the scientific view , however , has not shifted much at all . this 1981 assessment is still the opinion held by the scientific community today :
mixture	on 17 january 2017 , the willamette week reported a heartbreaking story : as the temperature there dipped below freezing , a homeless woman was discovered at a bus stop barefoot , clad in tattered clothes , and holding a dead baby : <PARA> this report is true , and was filed by a legitimate news organization . however , a photograph that was quickly attached to the already - shocking story in order to make it into a meme is not related to the incident : <PARA> the meme about the woman and her baby also spread the claim that the baby froze to death and did not die from a cause unrelated to the cold , which has been debated . first responders had previously reported that the child was alive when it was found , but the state ’ s medical examiner said that the infant was actually stillborn : <PARA> there are many factors to this story , none less tragic than any other — the fact that many people on the streets of portland , oregon ( as in many parts of the united states ) suffer from untreated mental illness ; that this 9 january 2017 death was not the first of the year from possible exposure in the local homeless population , nor even the second , but the fifth ; or that the mother of the dead baby is now nowhere to be found . however , this particular meme not only oversimplifies the issue , but uses a misleading photograph in order to do so .

true	origins : casey austin sheehan was a 24 - year - old u . s . army specialist from california who served as a mechanic with the first cavalry division out of fort hood , texas , and was killed in an ambush near sadr city , iraq , on <PARA> 4 april 2004 . his mother , cindy sheehan , is an anti - war activist and outspoken critic of the bush administration , engaging in protests such as holding a 26 - day vigil outside president george w . bush ’ s ranch in crawford , texas , while the president was vacationing there in august 2005 . <PARA> for two years after casey sheehan ’ s death , his burial site in a vacaville , california , cemetery remained unadorned with a formal headstone ( although it was marked by a simple placard ). in april 2006 , cindy sheehan attempted to articulate the reasons for the lack of a headstone at her son ’ s grave , citing her grief and unwillingness to acknowledge her son ’ s death with a tangible symbol : <PARA> for the first year after casey was killed , i didn ’ t want to believe it . i didn ’ t want to place a tombstone on my son ’ s grave . i didn ’ t want one more marble proof that my son was dead . i couldn ’ t even call where he was buried a “ cemetery ,” i had to call it “ casey ’ s park .” i placed fresh flowers in the cup every week and journaled there almost on a daily basis , and often laid on it and fell asleep and dreamed of my needlessly killed son . <PARA> in the same explanation , she also suggested that part of the reason for the lack of a headstone might be a dispute over monies paid to the mortuary that handled casey ’ s funeral services : <PARA> we had a casualty officer who abandoned us when our mortuary refused to pay the cemetery and told us that the “ government sent the money to the mortuary , so now it is your problem . you may have to sue the mortuary .” <PARA> the owner of the mortuary , steve nadeau , disputed this statement : <PARA> steve nadeau , the mortuary ’ s owner , said that not only did he properly pay the cemetery , but that he subsidized the process with his own money . <PARA> nadeau expressed hurt and disbelief at sheehan ’ s comments . he said that the amount of money the military gave the mortuary for casey ’ s funeral service and cemetery arrangements didn ’ t even come close to covering the costs . <PARA> “ several kind citizens made donations ,” said nadeau . “ i absorbed the rest .” <PARA> this was not the only way in which he went above and beyond his responsibilities following casey ’ s death , said nadeau . he also provided a stretch limousine and a driver at his expense , he said , and invited the family to go to the airport with him so that he could accompany them . none of this was required , said nadeau . <PARA> “ having known the sheehan family for many years through st . mary ’ s catholic church where ms . sheehan had previously been the youth director , it was my desire to provide care and dignity to casey and the family . i did this in every

mixture	in september 2018 , with most political debate and news coverage focused on the controversial nomination of judge brett kavanaugh to the u . s . supreme court , the u . s . congress faced the prospect of allowing a major piece of legislation to expire . <PARA> the violence against women act ( vawa ) was first proposed by then - senator joe biden in 1993 and signed into law in 1994 . it provided significant federal funding for services offered to survivors of domestic and sexual violence , created the office on violence against women within the justice department , enhanced the training of law enforcement officers in the area of sexual and domestic violence , and strengthened penalties for certain sexual crimes , most notably requiring perpetrators of sexual violence to pay restitution to their victims . <PARA> the act , which comprises several constitutive laws , has been reauthorized every few years since 1994 with adjustments and additions being made on each occasion , most notably in 2013 when — after an unusually long party - line battle in congress — the protections and provisions in the vawa were extended to same - sex couples . <PARA> the act had been scheduled to expire on sept . 30 , 2018 , prompting concerns that women , children , and men who are vulnerable to domestic and sexual violence would no longer be protected by the the funding , services and legal provisions associated with the vawa . <PARA> on oct . 1 , the democratic candidate for new york attorney general , tish james claimed on twitter that president donald trump ’ s administration had “ let the violence against women act expire without saying a word ”: <PARA> james ’ claim was retweeted thousands of times and prompted inquiries from our readers about its veracity . <PARA> in fact , the vawa was not allowed to expire on sept . 30 , 2018 , either by the trump administration or members of congress . james acknowledged this fact herself in a follow - up tweet in which she wrote : <PARA> on sept . 26 , five days before james ’ tweet , the house of representatives voted through house bill 6157 , an appropriations bill which provided funding through the 2019 financial year for the department of defense and other government departments , as well as an eclectic mix of several smaller measures , including spending related to the vawa . the relevant section of that bill read as follows : “ any program , authority , or provision , including any pilot program , authorized under the violence against women reauthorization act of 2013 shall continue in effect through the date specified in section 105 ( 3 ) of this act [ 7 december 2018 .]” <PARA> on sept . 28 , president trump signed h . r . 6157 into law , thus extending the provisions of the vawa until dec . 7 . he did not mention the vawa in either of his public statements about the appropriations bill . <PARA> however , congress failed to reauthorize the vawa and it expired in december 2018 . another short - term spending bill extended the provisions of the act until feb . 15 , 2019 , when it expired for a second time . repeated attempts to reauthorize since then have failed . the american bar association reported in may 2019 that : <PARA> as of november , however , the reauthorization bill appeared dead in the water after bipartisan talks fell apart in the senate . roll call reported that sen . jodi ernst , r - iowa , was set to introduce her own version of the bill , which she said would be able to pass the republican - controlled senate and gain president trump ’ s support .

false	in october 2014 , a group of concerned catholic bishops in kenya released a statement claiming a tetanus vaccine program aimed at women entering or in their childbearing years was in actuality a stealth attempt to sterilize women en masse for unstated reasons . <PARA> among questions raised by the group in its statement about the tetanus vaccine campaign in kenya were why the vaccines were considered necessary if no “ tetanus crisis in kenya ” had been declared , why the vaccine was offered primarily to women between the ages of 14 and 49 , why boys and men were not targeted by the campaign , and why tetanus was “ prioritized ” over other illnesses affecting citizens of kenya : <PARA> a catholic doctors ’ group in kenya echoed the concerns of the bishops , and an anti - abortion site quoted dr . muhame ngare of the mercy medical centre in nairobi as saying : <PARA> dr . collins tabu , the head of immunization at kenya ’ s health ministry , refuted the claim and said women immunized under the program in recent years subsequently conceived , promppting dr . ngare to respond with : <PARA> dr . ngare ’ s forced choice between the doctors or the kenyan government neglects a third possibility : someone , somewhere is sincere but mistaken . his statement about the timing of vaccinations in respect to the earliest age women can marry in kenya is a good illustration of fallacious thinking — since the vaccine is given in a five - shot series , beginning administration three years prior to marrying age makes more sense than exposing women who are married but not yet immunized to losing children to tetanus . <PARA> the expressed concerns of ngare and bishops in kenya are the same as false rumors circulated over two decades ago in several other countries ( mexico , tanzania , nicaragua , and the philippines ) where the who and unicef undertook tetanus vaccination programs : <PARA> these rumors ( and similar ones concerning polio vaccination programs ) have several aspects , one being the focus on women of childbearing age in kenya . neonatal tetanus resulted in the deaths of 550 kenyan babies in 2013 , and according to unicef , 58 , 000 babies worldwide died of neonatal tetanus in 2010 ( a count that includes only known tetanus deaths ). the organization explained the necessity of tetanus immunization in countries such as kenya , and how the scope of the problem could be even larger than has been recorded to date : <PARA> that information was echoed in an interview with james elder , unicef ’ s chief of communications for east africa , by the catholic family and human rights institute ( c - fam ): <PARA> another aspect of the debate concerns contraceptive vaccines , a medical initiative that has long been in the testing phase . however , the catholic bishops in kenya are not claiming that kenyan women are being given the equivalent of a contraceptive vaccine ( something which in current form would have to be readministered every few months to be effective ), but rather are being sterilized through the injection of a substance ( b - hcg ) that renders them permanently infertile . <PARA> the kenya catholic doctors association claimed they had tested samples of the tetanus vaccine used in kenya and found them to be laced with ( b - hcg ) ( a component of experimental birth control vaccines ), but unicef noted that there was no laboratory in kenya capable of making an accurate analysis of that nature : <PARA> again , this aspect of the claim perfectly mirrors similar rumors spread decades earlier during the course of tetanus vaccination programs in several other countries : <PARA> while no evidence has been offered to suggest that narrative was anything other than a desperate pr move by a business whose accreditation had been revoked , the claim of a government ’ s mandating doctored results to sell a secret sterilization program has not been ignored by conspiracy minded websites such as your news wire , which continued to promote agriq - quest ’ s claims as recently as february 2018 . <PARA> despite such claims , no compelling evidence exists that the tetanus vaccination program in kenya has been in any way animated by a desire to sterilize kenyan women . such claims have their roots in laboratory testing widely considered to have been flawed in method .
false	musician don mclean ’ s recollection of the day ( as a paperboy ) he cut open a stack of newspapers to find that rock - n - roll pioneer buddy holly had died led him to coin the term “ the day the music died ” to describe 3 february 1959 : the date on which a plane crash took the lives of holly , ritchie valens , and j . p . richardson ( the “ big bopper ”). the phrase became a part of popular culture when mclean used it in his hit song “ american pie ,” a cryptic song featuring ambiguous imagery and a coded history of rock ‘ n ’ roll . <PARA> the song ’ s varied interpretations have been widely debated for decades now . mclean himself has so far declined to provide any detailed answers , saying , “ if i told people what i meant , they ’ d just say , ‘ no you didn ’ t .'” <PARA> the starting point of most analyses of the song is its title : “ american pie .” what does “ american pie ” refer to ? we could makes some guesses , but this article is about what american pie is not : it is not , as widely reported on various lists of trivia that circulate on the internet , the name of the airplane on which buddy holly was a passenger when he died . <PARA> in an attempt to gain some extra rest time and avoid traveling on buses prone to mechanical breakdowns and faulty heating , during a grueling and cold “ winter dance party ” tour in early 1959 , holly chartered a private plane to fly himself and two band members to fargo , north dakota immediately after their february 2 performance in clear lake , iowa . ( the next day ’ s show was in moorhead , minnesota , but moorhead had no airport ; the closest facility was in fargo , ten miles away .) <PARA> the chartered plane , a red - and - white single - engine beechcraft bonanza , took off in the cold , windy , early morning hours of february 3 amidst light snow flurries . the plane never reached fargo . the next morning searchers discovered that it had crashed on a snow - covered field shortly after takeoff , skidding over 500 feet before coming to rest against a wire fence and killing everyone on board . <PARA> the airplane , chartered through dwyer ’ s flying service in clear lake , iowa , had no name . its only designation was its wing registration number , n3794n . how the rumor that its name was american pie ( thus providing don mclean the title for his song ) started circulating is unknown , but it is undeniably false . as don mclean himself said in 1999 : “ the growing urban legend that ‘ american pie ’ was the name of buddy holly ’ s plane the night it crashed , killing him , ritchie valens and the big bopper , is equally untrue . i created the term .” <PARA> ( another rumor regarding the title , that it was chosen because mclean once dated a miss america contestant , appears to be equally spurious .) <PARA> over the years , the list of people who “ gave up a seat ” on this ill - fated flight has grown significantly . although buddy holly initially may have asked around to find other tour members willing to share the cost of chartering a plane ( as dion dimucci claims ), the only persons who committed to fly on it with holly were his two fellow band members , tommy allsup and waylon jennings . <PARA> j . p . richardson , who was coming down with the flu , managed to talk jennings into giving up his seat so that he could arrive at the next tour stop early and have a little extra time to visit a doctor . ritchie valens spent the evening trying to convince allsup to give up his seat on the plane , but allsup , who needed to pick up a registered letter waiting for him in fargo , demurred . <PARA> finally , just as allsup was about to leave the surf city ballroom for the airport , he gave in and agreed to flip a coin with valens for a spot on the airplane . ( unlike the way this scene is depicted in the ritchie valens film biography la bamba , holly did not charter a plane for “ headliners only ” or arrange the last - minute coin toss between valens and allsup , nor did that coin toss take place outside in a snowfall just as the plane was boarding .) valens won the coin toss , and allsup stayed behind to ride the bus to the next destination . thus waylon jennings and tommy allsup were the only two persons who truly “ gave up a seat ” on buddy holly ’ s final flight .

true	origins : since the gist of this piece is an expression of the writer ’ s feelings about president bush after having encountered him while attending church , there isn ’ t much factual information to verify other than the identity of the writer . although president bush is a methodist , he has attended services at st . john ’ s church , an episcopal congregation located in lafayette square across from the white house , on a number of occasions , so it is quite plausible that a fellow churchgoer might spot him there on any given sunday when he is in washington . ( according to white house spokesperson jeanie mamo , the president and his family also visit lincoln park united methodist and washington national cathedral .) the president was in attendance at st . john ’ s on significant days such as 6 july 2003 , his 57th birthday , and on 11 september 2003 , the two - year anniversary of the terrorist attacks on the u . s ., and he also reportedly cancelled plans to visit st . john ’ s on 14 december 2003 because he did not want a church to be the setting for his first public appearance after the capture of saddam hussein . <PARA> this piece usually bears an attribution crediting it to laura lefler , a staffer employed in the office of u . s . senator lamar alexander of tennessee . the senator ’ s office confirmed for us that ms . lefler did indeed write and send the missive : <PARA> thanks for writing regarding ms . lefler ’ s e - mail . the e - mail reflects the personal experiences of one of our employees , and while we appreciate her enthusiasm , it should really have been sent from her personally and not from our office . since this is not an official communication of our office , we really can ’ t say anymore about it . we do appreciate your taking the time to get in touch with us .

false	while i ’ ve little interest in getting in the middle of the obama birth issue , paul hollrah over at fsm did so yesterday and believes the issue can be resolved by obama answering one simple question : <PARA> what passport did he use when he was shuttling between new york , jakarta , and karachi ? <PARA> so how did a young man who arrived in new york in early june 1981 , without the price of a hotel room in his pocket , suddenly come up with the price of a round - the - world trip just a month later ? <PARA> and once he was on a plane , shuttling between new york , jakarta , and karachi , what passport was he offering when he passed through customs and immigration ? <PARA> the american people not only deserve to have answers to these questions , they must have answers . <PARA> it makes the debate over obama ’ s citizenship a rather short and simple one . <PARA> q : did he travel to pakistan in 1981 , at age 20 ? <PARA> a : yes , by his own admission . <PARA> q : what passport did he travel under ? <PARA> a : there are only three possibilities : <PARA> 1 . he traveled with a u . s . passport , <PARA> 2 . he traveled with a british passport , or <PARA> 3 . he traveled with an indonesia passport . <PARA> q : is it possible that obama traveled with a u . s . passport in 1981 ? <PARA> a : no . it is not possible . <PARA> pakistan was on the u . s . state department ’ s “ no travel ” list in 1981 . <PARA> conclusion : when obama went to pakistan in 1981 he was traveling either with a british passport or an indonesian passport . <PARA> if he was traveling with a british passport that would provide proof that he was born in kenya on august 4 , 1961 , not in hawaii as he claims . <PARA> and if he was traveling with an indonesian passport that would tend to prove that he relinquished whatever previous citizenship he held , british or american , prior to being adopted by his indonesian step - father in 1967 . <PARA> whatever the truth of the matter , the american people need to know how he managed to become a “ natural born ” american citizen between 1981 and 2008 . <PARA> given the destructive nature of his plans for america , as illustrated by his speech before congress and the disastrous spending plan he has presented to congress , the sooner we learn the truth of all this , the better . <PARA> count me in as one of those inquiring minds who ’ d at least like to know the answers to these easily answered ( by obama ) questions . <PARA> origins : this item is yet another of many similar pieces purporting to offer some bit of evidence demonstrating that barack obama is not a native - born citizen of the u . s . and thus is ineligible to be president of the united states . the premise in this case is that a young barack obama visited pakistan back in 1981 , a country he allegedly could not have traveled to on a u . s . passport , and thus he must have used a passport issued by some other country , such as the u . k . ( obama ’ s father was a kenyan and thus a british subject ) or indonesia ( where obama lived for a while after his mother married an indonesian citizen ) — a circumstance supposedly demonstrating that barack obama wasn ’ t born in the u . s ., once held multiple citizenships , or at some point gave up his u . s . citizenship . <PARA> during a fundraiser in san francisco in april 2008 , barack obama made reference to a visit he had undertaken to pakistan during his college years ( a journey he <PARA> had not mentioned in either of his books ). his campaign press secretary , bill burton , later provided some additional detail about that trip to curious journalists : during the summer of 1981 , when he was twenty years old , barack obama visited with his mother and half - sister in indonesia , then embarked on a three - week trip to pakistan with a college friend whose family lived in karachi . however , the claim that barack obama must have set out on that trip to pakistan using a non - u . s . passport is false : the u . s . state department did not include pakistan on a “ no travel ” list barring americans from traveling there in mid - 1981 , and evidence documents that americans could in fact freely visit that country at that time . <PARA> the u . s . state department issues travel warnings ( which caution travelers about “ long - term , protracted conditions that make a country dangerous or unstable ”) and travel alerts ( which caution travelers about “ short - term conditions , generally within a particular country , that pose imminent risks to the security of u . s . citizens ”) but those warnings are purely advisory — they do not prohibit americans from traveling to the listed countries . the fact that the u . s . state department issued an informative travel advisory for pakistan in august 1981 ( to make american citizens aware of updated visa requirements for entering that country ) demonstrates that u . s . passport holders could freely travel to and from pakistan at the time of barack obama ’ s visit there . <PARA> moreover , during that same time period ( mid - 1981 ), new york times assistant news editor barbara crossette visited pakistan and wrote a column about her experiences , a piece in which she offered tips to other americans who might wish to visit that country . additionally , her column prompted a follow - up letter from john s . brims , then the u . s . consul general in lahore , pakistan , in which he “ welcome [ d ] an influx of americans ” who might have been inspired to come to pakistan by her article and also offered helpful tips for tourists traveling to that country by rail from india : <PARA> one of the pleasures of the foreign service is being able to serve in cities like lahore , and i would welcome an influx of americans who might have been inspired to come by barbara crossette ’ s piece , “ lahore , a survivor with a bittersweet history .” <PARA> but please caution them . <PARA> while tourists can obtain a free , 30 - day , non - extendable visa to pakistan at the wagah border crossing ( on the rail route from new delhi to lahore ), tourists cannot make the reverse journey from pakistan to india through the same crossing unless they already have an indian visa . the indians only offer this service , so far as i know , to tourists debarking at airports . we have had a number of americans stranded in lahore who did not know this , and they tend to be too discouraged to enjoy the city . <PARA> but please caution them . <PARA> while tourists can obtain a free , 30 - day , non - extendable visa to pakistan at the wagah border crossing ( on the rail route from new delhi to lahore ), tourists cannot make the reverse journey from pakistan to india through the same crossing unless they already have an indian visa . the indians only offer this service , so far as i know , to tourists debarking at airports . we have had a number of americans stranded in lahore who did not know this , and they tend to be too discouraged to enjoy the city . <PARA> many other news articles from 1981 reference either americans ’ traveling to pakistan or the pakistan government ’ s making efforts to encourage visits from u . s . tourists . <PARA> in short , if barack obama did visit pakistan in the summer of 1981 , he — like all other americans — could have openly done so bearing a u . s . passport .

mixture	takis are a brand of corn tortilla chips vended by mexico - based barcel and known for its spicy hotness : <PARA> an item that began circulating on the internet in june 2013 presents a first - person account of a woman who took her ten - year - old daughter to an urgent care facility for treatment of extreme stomach distress , where a physician reportedly suggested the daughter ’ s consumption of takis was the cause of her stomach pains ( even though the mother stated her daughter consumed just “ 3 small bags of takis a month ”). additionally , according to this account , the physician asserted that “ the harsh chemicals and seasoning in the chips cause corrosion in the throat and stomach ,” that takis are “ causing stomach ulcers in children ,” and that she was currently treating a 16 - month - old patient for throat cancer brought about by the toddler ’ s consumption of takis : <PARA> we consulted with some urgent care pediatricians of our acquaintance who told us that they had never treated , or heard of , any cases of children developing severe stomach pains linked to the consumption of takis . moreover , they said , no credible doctor would definitively pronounce that consumption of one type of food ( or any other single factor ) had “ caused ” a particular case of cancer — although relationships have been established between certain risk factors and the onset of cancer , no given case of cancer can be reliably attributed to one identifiable cause . <PARA> some reports indicate that cases of children developing stomach aches after eating takis and similar snack foods are known , but that the issue seems to be linked to children consuming those snacks in immoderate and excessive amounts far beyond the “ 3 small bags a month ” referenced in the above account : <PARA> as well , some physicians have noted that children have been taken to emergency rooms after eating takis and similar snacks not because they were ill , but because their excessive consumption of those snacks resulted in misinterpreted symptoms : <PARA> however , some critics maintain that children commonly over - consume such snack foods because the foods themselves are engineered to promote that behavior : <PARA> the bottom line remains that children should avoid spicy snack foods and other processed snacks in large quantities in order to avoid gastritis and other health risks , but no solid evidence indicates that moderate consumption of such snack foods puts youngsters at risk for stomach ulcers or cancer . <PARA> takis ’ parent company , barcel , did not respond to our request for additional information on this topic .
true	in his urban legend book the baby train , folklorist jan harold brunvand writes that he first heard the “ dead body found under hotel bed ” legend in 1991 . every version that came to him mentioned a las vegas hotel , but the lack of checkable details led him to believe this was an apocryphal tale . <PARA> okay , so we can date the appearance of this legend to 1991 . unlike a number of other such gruesome tales , this legend appears to have sprung from a misremembering of any one of a number of actual news items , with the talebearer shifting certain details so that deaths which took place in anonymous little motels along interstates are said to have happened in las vegas , america ’ s own sin city , and victims who ’ d ( usually ) done little else amiss than be in the wrong place at the wrong time and / or take up with questionable company were transformed through the magic of retelling into prostitutes . <PARA> dead bodies get stashed in the box spring or the bed ’ s pedestal more often than you ’ d want to believe . what ’ s more , a fair number of them are only discovered days later ... after the new tenant complains about a persistent and disagreeable odor . <PARA> in each of the following cases not only were bodies discovered under hotel beds , but it was investigations of the smell of decomposition that led to their discoveries . <PARA> on 10 july 2003 , a man checked into the capri motel , just east of downtown kansas city , and began complaining about a foul odor in his room . management told him nothing could be done about the problem , and he spent three nights in his room before checking out because he could no longer stand the smell . when the cleaning staff came in to make up the room on 13 july , they lifted the mattress and underneath found a man ’ s body in an advanced stage of decomposition . <PARA> on 10 june 1999 the rapidly decomposing remains of 64 - year - old saul hernandez were discovered inside the bed in room 112 at the burgundy motor inn in atlantic city , new jersey . a german couple had spent the night sleeping over hernandez ’ s remains , and it was their complaint to the manager about the smell in their room which led to the discovery of the corpse . <PARA> in july 1996 a woman ’ s body was found under a mattress in the colorado boulevard travelodge in pasadena , ca . apparently the motel ’ s staff discovered her ten days after her demise and only after guests had complained for several days of a foul odor coming from that room . <PARA> there were two stashed - and - smelly body cases in florida in 1994 . ( further adding to the confusability of these stories ’ taking place in the same year and the same state , in both instances the next tenants those rooms had were german tourists .) in august 1994 in fort lauderdale , hotel staff discovered the body of 47 - year - old bryan gregory tucked under a platform bed . though the staff had themselves noticed the strange smell for days , they only set about looking for its source after a german couple spent the night in that room and afterwards complained about the odor . <PARA> in march 1994 the body of 24 - year - old josefina martinez was found underneath a bed at the traveler ’ s hotel near miami international airport . again , the discovery was prompted by an aggrieved german tourist upset about a foul odor in his room . <PARA> in virginia in 1989 , jerry lee dunbar disposed of the remains of two victims this way : 27 - year - old deirdre smith , who was discovered in may under the floor of a motel room on route 1 , and 29 - year - old marilyn graham , who turned up in june under a bed in the alexandria econo lodge . in smith ’ s case , the killer first kept her body partially hidden under his bed for two days , then subsequently placed it in the crawl space under the carpeted floor . her presence seemingly didn ’ t bother him , because he didn ’ t move out of that room until three or four weeks later . both girls ’ bodies were eventually found after other guests complained about the stink . <PARA> in mineola , new york , motel in 1988 , a body turned up in a box spring . the remains of 29 - year - old mary jean deoliviera were found at the oceanside motel . again , the body was discovered days later and only after other patrons complained about the smell . at least two other guests unknowingly cohabited with the body before it was found , and at least one guest refused to stay in that room because of the smell . <PARA> here ’ s a change of pace — not a murder , but a death by misadventure . in rosedale , maryland in 1987 , an unidentified man died of a drug overdose after one of the thirty - four balloons of heroin he ’ d swallowed burst . his partner stashed the corpse under their motel bed , then split . three days later , the family the room was next rented to complained about the odor , and this led to the body ’ s discovery . <PARA> one of the oldest “ smelly body left under the bed ” sightings comes from 1982 . richard kuklinski , daniel deppner , and gary smith often teamed together to run auto theft scams . kuklinski and deppner decided to kill smith , and they accomplished this by feeding him a cyanide - laced hamburger in a north bergen , new jersey , motel room . kuklinkski finished off smith by strangling him when watching smith die of poisoning proved tiresome . smith ’ s body was stuffed under the bed and left there . it was found four days later , on 27 december 1982 . during the intervening four days , the room had been rented to others each night . guests had wrinkled their noses at the smell , but none thought to look under the bed . <PARA> that case has seemingly been topped by one in which sony millbrook of memphis , tennessee , was reported missing on 27 january 2010 after she failed to pick up her children from school . forty - seven days later , on 15 march 2010 , homicide investigators were called to the room of a budget inn motel where millbrook had been living just prior to her disappearance , her body having just been discovered inside the frame of the bed there — even though the room had reportedly been cleaned and rented several times since her disappearance almost seven weeks earlier . <PARA> there are , of course , numerous other cases of dead bodies being left under hotel beds , but i ’ ve chosen not to report on these because they lack the key element of the legend : complaints about the presence of a horrific smell leading to the corpse ’ s discovery . what gives this urban legend its chills - down - the - spine gruesomeness is the body ’ s being found only after an unsuspecting traveler spends the night sleeping above it . that clearly happened in at least some of the cases mentioned here ( and perhaps in others where the news reports stated only that hotel guests had complained without specifying which guests ). <PARA> urban legends tend to localize to where we believe they likely would have happened . it ’ s easy to understand how in each of the versions brunvand related that las vegas was always named as the city where the corpse reposed , for vegas is indeed viewed as sin city , usa . much easier to believe that the unsuspecting traveler shared his room with a moldering corpse in las vegas than it is to ( rightly ) place that occurrence in small - town new york , virginia , or maryland . especially when dealing with a half - remembered true story , it ’ s natural for the “ obvious ” details to replace facts that have been misplaced due to ordinary fuzziness of memory . one , after all , does not let a lack of certainty stand in the way of a good story . <PARA> keep in mind that the deirdre smith ( 1989 , virginia ), marilyn graham ( 1989 , virginia ), mary jean deoliviera ( 1988 , new york ), john doe ( 1987 , maryland ), and gary smith ( 1982 , new york ) cases antedate 1991 . gruesome finds like those tend to get heavily reported on , and that certainly happened with smith , graham and deoliviera ( the cites below don ’ t begin to do justice to the coverage these discoveries got — they were reported on by a double handful of various papers across the usa ). it is because of that widespread coverage that i lean towards this legend ’ s having sprung to life out of a true story whose location got shifted from your town , usa ( where only nice people live ) to sin city ( where life and room rates are cheap ). <PARA> sightings : look for this legend in the 1995 film four rooms . this legend was also the subject of a july 2014 fake news article .
false	examples : <PARA> is it true that the boy in the frosties advert ‘ they ’ re gonna taste great ’ commited suicide because he was bullied so much about doing the advert ? <PARA> [ collected via e - mail , june 2006 ] <PARA> there is possible rumour ( s ) bubbling under in the uk relating to a new tv advert for kellogg ’ s frosties . it contains a somewhat ‘ over the top ’ song and dance performance by a teen boy , and has been generating a lot of negative comment on forums in the uk regarding its ability to put off viewers . <PARA> on watching it yesterday my 15 year old son mentioned that he had heard in the playground chatter at school that the ‘ star ’ of the ad was in fact a terminally ill boy who had been granted the appearance as his dying wish . <PARA> origins : in june 2006 we began receiving inquiries about the fate of the adolescent boy who had appeared singing “ they ’ re gonna taste great ” in a uk kellogg ’ s frosties commercial that had first aired about a month earlier , ( for those americans not up on their international cereals , frosties are the equivalent of what are known in the u . s . as kellogg ’ s frosted flakes , right down to the same cartoon spokestiger .) the soon - to - be - notorious commercial was described by david whitehouse of the guardian as “ a jingle being sung by a boy at the exact moment his voice breaks , in a tone so monotonous it appears to be operating at a frequency which toys with people ’ s bowels ”: <PARA> the frosties spot was so noted for its irritating refrain and ability to annoy that the lad who starred in it reportedly received numerous online death threats , and according to subsequent rumors he was beaten or stabbed by hooligans who took it upon themselves to deride him for his role , or was verbally picked on by bullies to the extent that he was moved to take his own life . in this , the most common form of the legend , the boy ’ s annoying repetition of “ it ’ s <PARA> gonna taste great ” — and the equally monotonously - voiced rhyming phrases he delivered throughout the ad — cost him his life . <PARA> but the rumors also took a different form , one that did not have the boy ’ s death occur as a consequence of the commercial ( i . e ., he was attacked by others or died by his own hand ). in a secondary form of the legend , a grieving father who had lost his son to cancer succeeded , via the magic of technology , in having his deceased child inserted into the ad as a final tribute to the boy ( possibly because it was the lad ’ s dying wish ). here the youngster ’ s flatness of tone was , by implication , explained by the rumor : the oddly - sung jingle was the result of its having been pieced together after the boy ’ s death from recordings made of him during his brief lifetime . ( one of the more interesting alternative theories offered about the “ frosties kid ” had it that he wasn ’ t an actor at all , but rather a computer - generated creation .) <PARA> when we contacted kellogg ’ s uk offices about this rumor , they provided us with the following statement : <PARA> the current advertisement has been well received by the vast majority of our customers . we would also like to take this opportunity to confirm that the lead boy within the advertisement is well and continues to live in his native south africa . <PARA> the name of the young actor who portrayed the “ frosties kid ” was not publicized , and kellogg ’ s declined to provide us that information . in a september 2006 article the uk ’ s sun newspaper ( known far more for its sensationalism than its accuracy ) identified the young actor an active 15 - year - old gymnast in johannesburg , south africa — a country where the commercial had never aired — named “ sven ” ( other sources averred this was a pseudonym and the boy ’ s real name was matthew harban ) who was still very much alive despite having been targeted by “ online death threats ”: <PARA> the teen star of the much - hated frosties tv ad last night emerged from hiding to defy online death threats . <PARA> sven , 15 , was targeted by net nutters after appearing alongside cartoon tiger tony in the kellogg ’ s promotion . <PARA> in it , he sings a repetitive jingle as he leads a troop of kids , <PARA> pied piper - style , around a town while performing a strange dance . <PARA> last night the young south african actor , whose surname we are concealing to protect his safety , stormed : “ can ’ t these fools distinguish between me and a character in an ad ?” <PARA> “ why would people want to humiliate someone they don ’ t even know ?

false	on 29 august 2016 , the unreliable web site usa supreme published an item claiming that wikileaks founder julian assange told journalist john pilger that bernie sanders won the democratic presidential nomination but dropped out of the race after he was threatened . <PARA> that claim was aggregated to a number of questionable web sites and rocketed to the top of facebook ’ s trending topics list on 9 september 2016 . however , all iterations of the claim traced back to the original usa supreme article , which stated : <PARA> although multiple articles had repeated this claim as of 9 september 2016 , we found no other appearance of the alleged quote anywhere online other than usa supreme as of 30 august 2016 . moreover , usa supreme provided no information pertaining to the date of the interview , no link to the interview itself , nor an explanation of how they supposedly came into possession of information that would be headline news had it been credible . <PARA> neither pilger nor wikileaks made any reference on twitter ( through which assange frequently communicates ) to the “ bombshell ” claim . pilger did mention sanders by name on his official web site on 23 august 2016 , but he made no reference to his presumably newsworthy interview with assange : <PARA> another massive red flag in the original item was that the words attributed to pilger indeed stemmed from an interview with assange conducted back late july 2016 ( shortly after the dnc leaks controversy ), but those words were spoken by democracy now !’ s amy goodman , not by pilger : <PARA> what assange actually said in response to that query in no way resembled a claim that sanders had been threatened to drop out of the race : <PARA> interview questions and answers attributed to pilger and assange on 29 august 2016 by usa supreme matched much of goodman ’ s 25 july 2016 interview with the wikileaks ’ founder , and verbatim repetition of the very same queries and responses in a separate setting is highly implausible . moveover , prior to starting the rumor that julian assange had proclaimed bernie sanders was threatened , usa supreme similarly falsely attributed remarks made by massachusetts senator elizabeth warren to hawaii representative tulsi gabbard .

true	origins : as the popularity of this e - mail attests , the fact that one can find a wide disparity in drug prices from one pharmacy to the next was apparently surprising news to many people . and there ’ s probably some truth to the notion that because we tend to view generic drugs as great “ money - saving ” alternatives to brand drugs , we often don ’ t consider that the mark - up on generics can vary widely from one retailer to the next . <PARA> the basic facts laid out in the message quoted above are true . steve wilson , a reporter with wxyz - tv in detroit , conducted an investigative study into the cost of generic drugs at various pharmacies and other retail drug outlets and found quite a disparity between the highest and lowest prices <PARA> charged for certain generic drugs . for example , the prescription drug price comparison chart available in conjunction with wilson ’ s report shows that a one - month supply of fluoxetine hcl ( the generic for prozac ), which wholesales for $ 1 . 48 , varied in retail price from a high of $ 92 . 24 to a low of $ 9 . 69 just within the detroit area . <PARA> comparison shopping applies to generic drugs just as much as it does to food , clothing , dvds , automobiles , or any other product . those willing to do some hunting around get the best prices , and many drug comparison sites are available on the web to help consumers compare the costs of various drugs at different retail outlets before submitting their prescriptions ( although medical insurance or hmo restrictions may limit which pharmacies a covered patient can use ). price differences between pharmacies can ’ t necessarily be chalked up to nothing more than mere greed , however — some pharmacies offer additional levels of service ( such as staying open 24 hours a day ) and have to recoup the costs of those additional services by charging higher prices . <PARA> although we can ’ t guarantee that costco always has the lowest prices on generic drugs , it is generally true that their pharmacy will fill prescriptions for non - members ( but be prepared to pay by cash or atm card rather than check ). <PARA> later versions of this message had the following table added to the beginning : <PARA> big rip - off <PARA> the cost of prescription drugs <PARA> did you ever wonder how much it costs a drug company for the active ingredient in prescription medications ? some people think it must cost a lot , since many drugs sell for more than $ 2 . 00 per tablet . we did a search of offshore chemical synthesizers that supply the active ingredients found in drugs approved by the fda . as we have revealed in past issues of life extension , a significant percentage of drugs sold in the united states contain active ingredients made in other countries . <PARA> in our independent investigation of how much profit drug companies really make , we obtained the actual price of active ingredients used in some of the most popular drugs sold in america . the chart below speaks for itself . <PARA> the cost of prescription drugs <PARA> did you ever wonder how much it costs a drug company for the active ingredient in prescription medications ? some people think it must cost a lot , since many drugs sell for more than $ 2 . 00 per tablet . we did a search of offshore chemical synthesizers that supply the active ingredients found in drugs approved by the fda . as we have revealed in past issues of life extension , a significant percentage of drugs sold in the united states contain active ingredients made in other countries . <PARA> in our independent investigation of how much profit drug companies really make , we obtained the actual price of active ingredients used in some of the most popular drugs sold in america . the chart below speaks for itself . <PARA> this chart is of dubious accuracy and has little relevance ( other than an inflammatory one ), as far more goes into the retail pricing of drugs than the raw cost of their active ingredients . pharmaceutical companies expend money on the research and development costs of creating the drugs , plus the overhead costs of manufacturing , marketing , and shipping them ; as well , pharmacies must sell drugs for more than their wholesale prices in order to cover the overhead costs of store operations ( including pharmacists ’ salaries ).
true	on 11 october 2018 , a crown court judge handed down a sentence of life imprisonment to karen white of west yorkshire , england , who had pleaded guilty to multiple counts of rape , sexual assault , and unlawful ( malicious ) wounding . <PARA> the case was unusual , to say the least . as the yorkshire evening post reported , white is a transgender female who committed at least one of the rapes years ago when she still identified as a male . stranger still , she committed the assaults on female inmates after being transferred from a men ’ s to a women ’ s jail due to her declared gender change : <PARA> white was actually accused of perpetrating four sexual assaults on female prisoners , though she only confessed to two , after previously claiming that she suffered from erectile dysfunction and couldn ’ t have assaulted anyone at all . a report in the daily mail enumerated white ’ s offenses : <PARA> the rapes white confessed to occurred in 2003 and 2016 . white ( then known as stephen wood ) was placed under arrest in the first instance , an attack on the pregnant wife of a friend , but the case wasn ’ t prosecuted at the time for reasons that weren ’ t divulged in the 2018 trial . the second occurrence came to light when police questioned a woman who had returned a letter white wrote to her from jail . she told them white had violently raped her five or six times over the course of a year . <PARA> prior to 2003 , white had served jail time for indecent exposure and sexual assaults on children . more recently , according to the guardian , she admitted to probation officers that she was still sexually interested in minors and would “ think nothing ” of abusing a child . <PARA> the prosecuting attorneys openly questioned the sincerity of white ’ s gender change in court . prosecutor chris dunn referred to white as an “ alleged ” transgender female , pointing out that “ there is a smattering of evidence in this case that the defendant ’ s approach to transition has been less than committed .” <PARA> addressing the defendant during sentencing , judge christopher batty said : “ you are a predator and highly manipulative and in my view you are a danger . you represent a significant risk of serious harm to children , to women and to the general public .” <PARA> in any case , white will serve out her sentence in a men ’ s prison . although the decision to move her to a women ’ s jail pending trial was rendered in accordance with a 2017 policy update emphasizing the right of prisoners to be treated “ according to the gender in which they identify ,” the prison service admitted that mistakes were made in white ’ s case and publicly apologized . <PARA> jenny - anne bishop , a member of the transgender rights group transforum , said the local board charged with deciding where prisoners should be incarcerated ought to have taken white ’ s entire history of criminal offenses into account but didn ’ t . moreover , certain procedural steps that could have ensured white was placed in a facility where she wouldn ’ t pose a risk to herself or others weren ’ t taken . <PARA> despite what happened in white ’ s case , bishop defends the system , which is meant to protect transgender people from harm as well as the general prison population , as workable . “ it is almost the exception that proves the rule ,” she told the guardian , “ you ’ ve just got to look at what went wrong and make sure it doesn ’ t happen again . no system is perfect .” <PARA> according to a government survey , there are 125 known transgender prisoners in england and wales , though the ministry of justice says the actual number is probably higher . nearly half of the 125 identified have been convicted of one or more sexual offenses .
false	origins : in common english speech , “ hoity - toity ” is an adjective used with disdain to refer to the pretentious , those who put on a show of pretending to possess refinement and sophistication ( similar to “ highfalutin ”). so , some people naturally assume that such an unusual expression , referring to the cultured , must itself have a cultured origin — in this case a french - language reference to the ( literal ) upper class , people who looked down <PARA> upon others from atop their high roofs ( i . e ., haut toit ). <PARA> “ hoity - toity ” has nothing to do with french ( or the french ), however . the expression comes from our penchant for creating rhyming phrases such as “ loosey - goosey ” or “ helter - skelter ,” and in this case its base is “ hoit ,” an obsolete 16th century verb whose meaning is “ to play the fool ” or “ to indulge in riotous and noisy mirth .” (“ hoity - toity ” was more commonly used to describe those who engaged in thoughtlessly silly or frivolous behavior before it became more of a synonym for “ pretentious .”) attempts to find the word “ haughty ” to be an ancestor of “ hoity - toity ” are equally specious .

true	origins : “ do as i say , not as i do ” is an aphorism we usually associate with those who give others instructions or advice or guidelines that they themselves don ’ t follow . that phrase springs to mind as an apt description of an incident involving <PARA> a u . s . drug enforcement agency ( dea ) agent who accidentally shot himself while presenting a lecture on gun safety . <PARA> on 9 april 2004 , a dea agent ( who has not been identified by name in press accounts ) delivered a presentation on gun safety to about 50 adults and students at an event sponsored by the orlando minority youth golf association . partway through his lecture , the agent picked up his . 40 - caliber duty weapon and held it up for the audience to see as he announced : “ this is a glock 40 . fifty cent , too short , all of them talk about a glock 40 , ok ? i ’ m the only one in this room professional enough that i know of to carry this glock 40 .” seconds later the gun discharged , wounding the agent in the thigh ( or the foot , or the leg , according to various press accounts ). <PARA> after the agent inquired to make sure no one else present had been hurt , he gamely limped around the front of the room , turning the mishap into an object lesson for his audience : “ see how that accident happened , that could happen to you and you could be blown away .” ( a bit of humor occurred a few minutes later when the agent called for his assistant to hand him another gun , and a voice from the audience called out : “ put it down ! put it down !”) <PARA> fortunately , the agent did not sustain serious injury ( it isn ’ t clear from the news accounts and video whether he was actually hit by a bullet or suffered a powder burn to his thigh from the close - range discharge ), and he returned to work after being treated at orlando regional medical center . <PARA> according to a news report of the time : <PARA> a federal drug agent shot himself in the leg during a gun safety presentation to children and his bosses are investigating . <PARA> the drug enforcement administration agent , whose name was not released , was giving a gun safety presentation to about 50 adults and students organized by the orlando minority youth golf association , witnesses and police said . <PARA> he drew his . 40 - caliber duty weapon and removed the magazine , according to the police report . then he pulled back the slide and asked someone in the audience to look inside the gun and confirm it wasn ’ t loaded , the report said . <PARA> witnesses said the gun was pointed at the floor and when he released the slide , one shot fired into the top of his left thigh . <PARA> “ the kids screamed and started to cry ,” said vivian farmer , who attended the presentation with her 13 - year - old nephew . <PARA> “ everyone was pretty shaken up ,” farmer said . “ but the point of gun safety hit home . unfortunately , the agent had to get shot . but after seeing that , my nephew doesn ’ t want to have anything to do with guns .” <PARA> the agent was treated at orlando regional medical center after the april 9 shooting and returned to work , dea special agent joe kilmer said . <PARA> police ruled the shooting was an accident , but the dea headquarters in washington was still investigating , kilmer said . <PARA> the drug enforcement administration agent , whose name was not released , was giving a gun safety presentation to about 50 adults and students organized by the orlando minority youth golf association , witnesses and police said . <PARA> he drew his . 40 - caliber duty weapon and removed the magazine , according to the police report . then he pulled back the slide and asked someone in the audience to look inside the gun and confirm it wasn ’ t loaded , the report said . <PARA> witnesses said the gun was pointed at the floor and when he released the slide , one shot fired into the top of his left thigh . <PARA> “ the kids screamed and started to cry ,” said vivian farmer , who attended the presentation with her 13 - year - old nephew . <PARA> “ everyone was pretty shaken up ,” farmer said . “ but the point of gun safety hit home . unfortunately , the agent had to get shot . but after seeing that , my nephew doesn ’ t want to have anything to do with guns .” <PARA> the agent was treated at orlando regional medical center after the april 9 shooting and returned to work , dea special agent joe kilmer said . <PARA> police ruled the shooting was an accident , but the dea headquarters in washington was still investigating , kilmer said . <PARA> nearly a year later , in march 2005 , a home video of the incident was leaked to the internet and made available on several web sites , such as this one .

unproven	a world record of any sort normally gains substantial traditional news coverage . but since 2016 , fringe health sites have exploited the stereotype of “ mainstream media ” exclusion in spreading a story about a purportedly remarkable medical achievement . <PARA> at some point in 2016 , a photograph of a woman identified as “ ava roberts ” surfaced online , along with text celebrating her allegedly having become “ the youngest female african - american doctor ”: <PARA> healthy living life facts ” republished the ava roberts article in its entirety in december 2017 , and that account was spread widely on social media platforms such as facebook and twitter . <PARA> a number of websites that originally published this claim , as “ healthy living life facts ” did in june 2016 , cited a french site called “ pelea ” as its source : <PARA> none of those sites actually linked to the referenced “ pelea ” website , or to any other external source that documented or provided additional information about the claim . nor did any of those sites provide any details of ava roberts ’ life and supposed achievements , such as when and where she was born , when and where she attended medical school , what area of medicine she entered into , or where she currently practices . <PARA> moreover , the original claim was quite ambiguous to begin with : was ava roberts supposedly “ the youngest female african - american doctor ” in the world , in a particular country , or in some smaller jurisdiction ? what standard was applied to use of the title “ doctor ”? what organization certified or verified this accomplishment ? <PARA> using various search tools we were able to locate only one doctor by the name of ava roberts who is currently practicing in the united states . she is an orthopedic surgeon in colorado , but a spokesperson for the uchealth system , which manages several hospitals in the state as well as parts of wyoming and nebraska , told us that she is not the unidentified person whose photograph has accompanied this story . <PARA> we do note that it is not impossible for someone under the age of 25 to be a certified medical professional . in 2013 , the medical news site the do profiled several doctors in that age range , and the current guinness book of world records holder for becoming a doctor at the youngest age ever is held by balamurali ambati , who graduated from mount sinai school of medicine in 1995 at the age of 17 .
false	a bizarre conspiracy theory holding that u . s . musician jimi hendrix faked his death in 1970 and is now living as renown actor morgan freeman is frequently shared on social media . for instance , newspunch , a website that has repeatedly trafficked in this sort of misinformation , published an article entitled “ morgan freeman is jimi hendrix , researchers claim ” in may 2018 , stating : <PARA> newspunch later updated the intro and title of this article to make it clear that this rumor originated with conspiracy theorists and not “ researchers ”: <PARA> the idea that freeman is actually hendrix is largely based on three claims : freeman and hendrix are both fans of music ; freeman and hendrix look alike ; and freeman ’ s acting career didn ’ t take off until after hendrix ’ death in 1970 . <PARA> while the first two claims may be accurate , they are also not especially convincing . after all , freeman and hendrix are far from the only people who enjoy music . freeman does own a blues bar in mississippi , but if liking blues music is the threshold for evidence , it ’ s equally likely that freeman is actually robert johnson , howlin ’ wolf , freddie king , little walter , big bill broonzy , mississippi john hurt , t - bone walker , or any other famous , deceased blues musician . <PARA> freeman ’ s appreciation for blues music probably speaks more to his upbringing in memphis , tennessee , and chicago , illinois , than it does to the claim that freeman is actually a deceased musician . <PARA> freeman and hendrix also do bare a passing resemblance to one another : <PARA> however , many of the image comparisons accompanying this rumor border on parody . the website wellaware1 , for instance , attempted to draw a definitive link between freeman and hendrix based on the wrinkles seen in two photographs taken decades apart : <PARA> scribbling lines onto a photograph does not constitute evidence . <PARA> the final claim , holding that freeman ’ s career didn ’ t begin until after hendrix ’ s death , is inaccurate . <PARA> hendrix died on sept . 18 , 1970 . a post - mortem examination found that hendrix died of “ suffocation due to barbiturate intoxication .” a newspaper clipping on hendrix ’ death can be found below : <PARA> tue , sep 29 , 1970 – 78 · chicago tribune ( chicago , illinois ) · newspapers . com <PARA> while freeman was not a household name at the time of hendrix ’ s death , his acting career began prior to 1970 . morgan ’ s first onscreen appearance came in 1964 in a non - credited role in the sidney lumet movie “ the pawnbroker .” freeman also appeared in at least four stage productions , including “ hello , dolly !,” “ the dozen ,” and “ exhibition ,” prior to hendrix ’ s death . here ’ s a newspaper clipping from 1969 featuring an unflattering review of “ the dozens ” published in the herald - news : <PARA> fri , mar 14 , 1969 – 50 · the herald - news ( passaic , new jersey ) · newspapers . com <PARA> it seems a bit implausible that hendrix was moonlighting as an actor at the same time he was performing as a musician just so that he could fake his death and pursue a career in the movies .

false	origins : in the wake of 2005 ’ s hurricane katrina and the maelstrom of accusations and fingerpointing slow response to that disaster engendered , this ancient piece about the rev . jesse jackson was revived and circulated anew . in 1994 it made the rounds in the form of an exchange between jesse jackson and president george h . w . bush : <PARA> jesse jackson calls george at the white house and says “ george , i understand that all of the washing machines at the white house are white .” george responds , “ i dunno jesse , let me check it out and i ’ ll call you back .” next day george calls jesse back and says , “ jesse , you were right . i checked it out and all the washing machines at the white house are white , but all the agitators are black !” <PARA> this well - traveled anecdote is an amusing study in double meanings : “ agitator ” serves to describe both a political troublemaker and the washing machine part that churns water . yet at a deeper level , the witticism is intended not as humor but as a denigration <PARA> of a type of political activism for which the rev . jackson serves as a symbol — he is perceived by many not as a true civil rights crusader in the mold of dr . martin luther king , jr . or nelson mandela , but as a manipulative politician who manufactures and exploits racial controversy for his own political ends . thus the joke labels him an “ agitator ” within the framework of a story about a harebrained protest over the color of household appliances to represent the perception of rev . jackson as someone primarily concerned not with advancing the cause of civil rights , but with stirring up racial discord for the sake of generating publicity and enhancing his own political standing . <PARA> while this chronicle of a protest over the color of washing machines is fiction , it is worth noting the quip that forms the basis of it has been employed in real life by at least one african american office seeker . in 1999 during his mayoral bid in biddeford , maine , rory holland referred to himself as a “ little black agitator in a white washing machine .” <PARA> barbara “ he washed out in the election ” mikkelson
false	the conspiracy internet is extremely predictable in the wake of horrific national tragedies . one of the most common claims made in this cynical , opportunistic online world is the nebulous assertion of a “ second shooter ” during mass shootings , often associated with suggestions of a nefarious but wholly undefined government cover - up or plot . <PARA> far - right conspiracy theorist and infowars founder alex jones has proposed the existence of a second shooter at the october 2017 las vegas shooting , 2016 ’ s pulse nightclub shooting in orlando , and the aurora movie theatre shooting — to give just a small ( but entirely representative ) fraction of his analyses . in his click - driven world , the recent parkland school shooting is no different . the day after the shooting , jones ’ site , infowars . com , reported : <PARA> this is a factual summary of an account of the shooting given to khou sports reporter matt musil , who was on assignment in florida covering the houston astros training camp at the time of the shooting . during that interview , the marjory stoneman douglas high school student said that she walked out of the school with the ( admitted ) shooter after the shooting had occurred , remarking to him that “ i ’ m surprised you [ cruz ] weren ’ t the one who did it .” <PARA> because she saw him after the shooting , she told musil , she figured there had to be a second shooter if cruz was involved : <PARA> that belief notwithstanding , the student ’ s account is fully consistent with the story cruz gave to police and the other official accounts of the event . as stated in his arrest warrant , cruz ditched his gun after the shooting and slipped out of the crowd as one of the hundreds of fleeing students — a scenario consistent with the student ’ s report . <PARA> this is , as a matter of fact , the reason it took so long before police could detain the suspect , causing a lengthy period of uncertainty about his whereabouts . he was eventually caught away from the scene of the crime “ after buying a drink at a subway restaurant ,” according to usa today . <PARA> infowars . com later identified a second student ’ s testimony purportedly referencing a second shooter . that testimony , given by a student who was interviewed by multiple outlets and who appeared in at least one television news segment , comes with an understandable lack of clarity given the frantic nature of the interviews and their immediacy with respect to the event itself . her answers are filled with ambiguous pronouns making it possible for people like jones to sow doubt and build their own meaning out of the confusion . in one of those videos , a reporter asked if there was a second shooter , but her answer ( which actually cuts off the end of the reporter ’ s question ) is further muddled by the sound of a vehicle in the background : <PARA> it is unclear if the student , who was responding to a sea of reporters directly after a horrific , violent attack , meant she heard three different bursts of gunfire ( cruz brought multiple magazines to the school in a backpack according to the warrant ), or if she heard evidence that there were “ three shooters ” ( one more , it bears mentioning , than infowars . com had been alleging ). <PARA> in any event , throughout the rest of that interview , and in interviews with numerous other outlets , she repeatedly refers to the shooter as a single male person , using the words “ he ” and “ him ” to refer to the person perpetrating the murders . <PARA> jones and his ilk use this kind of first - hand , ambiguous , in - the - moment information to sow doubt about the “ official ” narrative given by the “ mainstream media .” this allows them to raise , but not demonstrate , the specter of a nefarious government plot to steal the american populace ’ s guns — that “ false flag ” argument that is in vogue on conspiracy websites these days . <PARA> jones made this connection explicit in a 15 february 2018 segment on his podcast : <PARA> the fact of the matter is that while these videos may not offer complete clarity , they are far from proof of anything that goes against the official narrative presented by police and admitted to by the perpetrator himself . <PARA> the primary interview used to make the argument of a second shooter tells a story wholly consistent with the actions of the single shooter , if — as cruz later testified — he escaped along with the crowd . the second interview is far too ambiguous to allow anyone to draw definitive conclusions , and it could also just as convincingly be interpreted as evidence of a single shooter . as such , we rank claims of eyewitness accounts confirming a second shooter as false .

false	on 2 november 2017 , the disreputable web site neon nettle reported falsely that seven “ key witnesses ” to the mass shooting on the las vegas strip one month earlier had died under “ suspicious circumstances ”, and that there was a “ sinister ” plot afoot to snuff out people who made statements in the immediate aftermath of the massacre that appeared to support the conspiracy theory trope that there was more than one shooter that night . <PARA> law enforcement leading the investigation into the massacre have concluded that stephen paddock , 64 , was the lone gunman on 1 october 2017 , when he opened fire with a modified weapon from the 32nd floor of the mandalay bay resort and casino onto a crowd below attending an outdoor country music festival . neon nettle , along with other conspiratorial web sites , have been aggressively pushing the idea that paddock had an accomplice . conspiracy buffs have decided that the las vegas shooting was yet another massive cover - up — a “ false flag ,” or government - engineered catastrophe meant to facilitate a nationwide gun - grab in the service of an ominous global cabal waiting in the wings to seize world power . <PARA> with great paranoia , neon nettle reported : <PARA> none of the deaths of “ key witnesses ” mentioned in the neon nettle story were linked , other than the fact some of them were part of a crowd of at least 22 , 000 people attending the outdoor route 91 harvest festival when the shooting took place . among the seven named , two died in an apparent car accident . one appears to have been misidentified by conspiracy theorists . a third is , in fact , not dead , while another had serious medical complications . in another instance , the deceased had no link whatsoever to the mass shooting , while the final “ key witness ” named , in display of sheer laziness by neon nettle , is paddock , the shooter . <PARA> dennis and lorraine carver : lorraine carver allegedly wrote on social media that her husband protected her from “ shooters ”. carver and her husband dennis were killed on 16 october 2017 in a car accident near their home in murrieta , california , when their car veered off a curve in a road at 10 : 50 p . m ., striking a metal gate and catching fire . both were pronounced dead at the scene . <PARA> danny contreras : on 23 october 2017 , police and fire personnel discovered the body of danny contreras , 35 , who died of multiple gunshot wounds in a vacant home in las vegas . police said they believe the homicide was narcotics - related . according to neon nettle , a now - suspended twitter account apparently being used by a person using that name posted that he was lucky to have gotten out of the concert alive after being chased by two men with guns . however there is no evidence that the homicide victim was the same person who wrote the tweets — comparison of an image on a fundraiser for the murdered man launched on 25 october 2017 in north las vegas and the profile picture of the man pointed out by neon nettle appears to demonstrate that they are in fact two different people . <PARA> chad nishimura : neon nettle initially and falsely reported nishimura , a mandalay bay hotel worker “ disappeared ” after he told a local news station he had valeted paddock ’ s car and said paddock “ didn ’ t have any crazy bags with him that i can remember .” the conspiratorial web site is now reporting nishimura was murdered outside the las vegas church , iglesia la luz del mundo . a man named hector antonio lemus - flores , 45 , of north las vegas , was murdered on 16 october 2017 outside that church . neon nettle simply transposed the details of lemus - flores ’ death onto their story to falsely claim the victim had been nishimura , who is alive . <PARA> kymberley suchomel : 28 - year - old suchomel passed away in her sleep a week after the massacre . according to her grandmother , who found her in bed in her apple valley , california home on 9 october 2017 , suchomel had seizures and was taking medication for a tumor . suchomel was apparently experiencing trouble sleeping as sounds and images from the massacre would terrorize her at night . she drew the attention of conspiracy theorists with a now - private facebook post attributed to her in which she said there was more than one shooter , writing : <PARA> john beilman : on 4 october 2017 , beilman , 60 , shot and killed his severely - disabled 27 - year - old daughter in the backyard of their fairport , new york home before turning the gun on himself . there is no connection between that tragedy and the las vegas massacre — a link between the two deadly incidents was established exclusively by disreputable conspiracy sites like whatdoesitmean . according to rationalwiki , the work on that web site is of such quality that “ even other conspiracy nutters don ’ t think much of it .” <PARA> the seventh “ key witness ” included on neon nettle ’ s list is the shooter himself , stephen paddock . after shooting at the crowd for 10 minutes , paddock turned his weapon on himself . of course paddock wasn ’ t a “ witness .” he was the perpetrator . he was included in the list perhaps as an effort to ramp up the cloak - and - dagger effect or simply beef up the body count — neon nettle implied there had been suspicious circumstances for his death as well : <PARA> according to police radio traffic which can be found archived at broadcastify , paddock did not exchange gunfire with police . when they breached the door and went inside , paddock was already down .
unproven	george bernard shaw ( 1856 - 1950 ) was one of the most fascinating intellectual figures of both the 19th and the 20th centuries . a nobel prize - winning dramatist , literary critic , and socialist spokesman , he was also a vociferous advocate of such causes as women ’ s rights , equality of income , the abolition of private property , a restructuring of the voting system , the simplification of <PARA> spelling , and the reform of the english alphabet . <PARA> perhaps the lowest point of shaw ’ s remarkable career was the world war i era , when his scathing opposition to the war drew the ire of the british government and nearly resulted in his being tried for treason . not surprisingly , shaw responded to his critics with his pen , crafting the play now known as heartbreak house , a devastating commentary on the “ great war ” and a bitter and withering attack on the spiritually bankrupt generation responsible for it . <PARA> shaw ’ s sardonic wit was not restricted to the text of the play , however . the drama , shaw ’ s first new work in several years , was eagerly anticipated by a london theatre - going crowd finally freed from the <PARA> horrors of the long and bloody war with germany . but shaw , in a fit of churlishness brought on by anger over public criticism of his anti - war stance , mischievously titled his play closed for remodeling . theatre owners who staged shaw ’ s new offering shook their heads in puzzled disbelief at the sparse crowds in attendance night after night . finally , when the play was into the third week of its initial run ( and two of the four london theatres staging it had already shut down their productions ), a stage manager at the savoy theatre finally realized the problem : the playbills advertising closed for remodeling that had been posted all over town were leading patrons to believe the theatre was temporarily shut down for renovation . <PARA> the savoy re - launched the play under the title heartbreak house , and it has been known by that name ever since . shaw himself professed innocence , of course , but there was little doubt that the results of his unfortunate choice of title were exactly what he had planned . as always , g . b . had the last laugh .

true	freezing temperatures , avalanches , and altitude sickness are common hazards among mountain climbers along the route to the peak of mount everest . but in may 2019 , another factor , overcrowding , was partially to blame for the deaths of several climbers on the 8 , 848 - meter ( 29 , 029 - foot ) himalayan summit : <PARA> many news outlets that reported on these dangerous conditions illustrated their articles with a remarkable photograph supposedly showing a long queue of climbers waiting to ascend to everest ’ s summit . although this image was published by legitimate news organizations , such as the new york times , agence - france presse , the washington post , cnn , cbs news , and bbc news , some viewers found the visual of hundreds of climbers lined up along the ridge of one of the world ’ s tallest mountain simply too strange for reality : <PARA> this is a genuine photograph from near the summit of mount everest . it was taken on 22 may 2019 by nirmal purja , a mountaineer attempting to climb all 14 of the 8 , 000 - meter himalayan peaks in a single seven - month season . <PARA> purja uploaded the image to his social media pages along with a brief description of what it showed : “ on 22nd of may , i summited everest at 5 : 30 am and [ reached ] lhotse 3 : 45 pm despite of the heavy traffic ( roughly 320 people )”: <PARA> a video of this “ traffic jam ” on everest was also available via the twitter account everest today : <PARA> purja is attempting to climb all 14 of the peaks in a single season as part of his “ project possible ” expedition , a fundraising effort that “ supports orphanages , disabled and children in need of support in nepal .” purja wrote on the project possible ’ s gofundme page that : <PARA> purja isn ’ t the first person to capture a photograph of large crowds on mount everest . in fact , this phenomenon has been a growing problem on the popular peak . in may 2012 , climber ralf dujmovits took a similar photograph of a long line of people making their way up the mountain , which can be seen in a broadcast from abc news :
false	origins : every political leader — whether he be a democratically elected representative or a usurping tyrant — seeks to gain broad public support , because the greater his support , the greater his power . that power may ultimately be used for good or for bad , but either way it must be obtained before it can be wielded . <PARA> of the best ways to gain the support of the people you want to lead is to do something of benefit to them . failing that , the next best thing is to convince them that you have done something of benefit to them , even though you really haven ’ t . so it was with benito mussolini and the italian railway system . <PARA> after the “ march on rome ” ( which was itself a myth of fascist propaganda ) on 28 october 1922 that resulted in king vittorio emanuele ’ s appointment of benito mussolini as prime minister and the accession to power of the fascists in italy , mussolini needed to convince the people of italy that fascism was indeed a system that worked to their benefit . thus was born the myth of fascist efficiency , with the train as its symbol . the word was spread that mussolini had turned the dilapidated italian railway system into one that was the envy of all europe , featuring trains that were both dependable and punctual . in mussolini ’ s italy , all the trains ran on <PARA> time . <PARA> well , not quite . the italian railway system had fallen into a rather sad state during world war i , and it did improve a good deal during the 1920s , but mussolini was disingenuous in taking credit for the changes : much of the repair work had been performed before mussolini and the fascists came to power in 1922 . more importantly ( to the claim at hand ), those who actually lived in italy during the mussolini era have borne testimony that the italian railway ’ s legendary adherence to timetables was far more myth than reality . <PARA> the myth of mussolini ’ s punctual trains lives on , albeit with a different slant : rather than serving as a fictitious symbol of the benefits of fascism , it is now offered as a sardonic example that something good can result even from the worst of circumstances . as montagu and darling wrote : <PARA> mussolini may have done many brutal and tyrannical things ; he may have destroyed human freedom in italy ; he may have murdered and tortured citizens whose only crime was to oppose mussolini ; but ‘ one had to admit ’ one thing about the dictator : he ‘ made the trains run on time .’ <PARA> no , thanks . i ’ d rather walk . <PARA> sightings : in an episode of televisions l . a . law (“ romancing the drone ,” originally aired 17 november 1988 ), michael kuzak answers grace van owen ’ s criticism with “ and mussolini made the trains run on time .”
false	origins : excedrin , a headache relief product from the bristol - myers squibb company , was offering to donate money to the toys for tots program for each visitor who came to their site and clicked on the toys for tots logo in december 2002 . ( toys for tots is a charitable program run by the united states marine corps reserve which collects donations of new , unwrapped toys and distributes them as christmas gifts to needy children .) <PARA> although the circulating message claimed that excedrin was donating $ 1 to toys for tots for each web site visitor , neither the excedrin web site nor the bristol - myers squibb web site mentioned that amount ; they both simply stated that for each click excedrin “ will donate money to help the marine corps toys for tots foundation buy gifts for needy families .” ( their public relations department did confirm for us that they were donating $ 1 per click , however .) the excedrin web site mentioned that the charity promotion would run “ through december 31 , 2002 , or until the $ 5 , 000 maximum donation level has been reached , whichever occurs sooner ,” so if they truly were donating $ 1 per click , they probably reached their maximum donation level long before the december 31 cut - off date .
false	since 2016 , a number of national football league players have been peacefully protesting against police brutality and social inequality by kneeling while the national anthem plays during pre - game ceremonies . <PARA> many , including united states president donald trump , have labeled these protests as unpatriotic and have called on players to stand during the playing of the star spangled banner . the controversy entered a new phase on 5 june 2018 , when the white house released a statement explaining that an event with the philadelphia eagles — winners of super bowl lii — had been cancelled : <PARA> supporters posted messages on social media in an apparent attempt to fortify the president ’ s position : <PARA> fox news muddied the waters still more when they aired a segment about the cancellation of the event which featured several images of eagles players kneeling . these images , however , do not show players protesting anything , but praying or kneeling momentarily for other reasons : <PARA> eagles player zach ertz chastised the network for using images of him and his teammates in prayer as “ propaganda ” to push the kneeling narrative : <PARA> fox news eventually deleted their tweet containing the video report , issuing an apology for the misleading images in its place . christopher wallace , executive producer of fox news @ night , also explained that no members of the philadelphia eagles knelt in protest during the anthem throughout the regular season or their successful super bowl post - season run : <PARA> former eagles player torrey smith was one of the first to counter the idea : <PARA> we were unable to find any record of an eagles player kneeling in protest throughout the 2017 regular season or during the team ’ s post - season super bowl run . as kirk later noted , nfl player ron brooks did kneel while he was suited up for the eagles during a pre - season game in august 2017 . however , brooks was waived from the roster before the start of the season . <PARA> a report from sportspundit . com that delved into instances of protest during the 2017 nfl season found that while a number of eagles players demonstrated in some fashion ( raising a fist , interlocking arms ), no player knelt . <PARA> espn also kept a record of all the players who staged a protest during each week of the 2017 season . with the exception of the third week , when teams around the league held joint protests in response to remarks from trump during a rally that any player kneeling was a “ son of a bitch ” who should be fired , a typical eagles demonstration went as follows :
false	this warning about the dangers of women wearing various brands of absorbent sanitary pads for more than five hours per day was circulated widely on the internet in september 2013 : <PARA> examples : [ collected via e - mail , september 2013 ] <PARA> attributed to a “ public service message ” from the tata cancer hospital , it warned that the extended use of certain types of sanitary napkins ( e . g ., procter & gamble ’ s whisper and always ultra , and mcneil ’ s stayfree ) results in uterine and bladder cancer , and that 56 girls had died from such causes . wearing a single pad of the types listed ( rather than ordinary cotton pads ) for more than five hours per day , it claimed , would turn one ’ s blood “ green ” and cause a fungus to form “ inside the uterus and body .” <PARA> there is a facility known as the tata memorial hospital in mumbai , india , but it professed neither knowing nor endorsing anything about the warnings and its claims . and although the extended wear of a single sanitary pad for a prolonged period of time might potentially cause some hygiene and health issues , we found nothing to substantiate the notion that simply wearing one pad per day ( rather than changing pads every five hours or less ) creates any serious medical concern , much less that it leads to uterine and bladder cancer , has turned anyone ’ s blood green , or has caused the deaths of 56 young women . <PARA> it is true that synthetic materials of the types used in some high - absorbency feminine sanitary products can trap heat and dampness , which may promote the growth of yeast and bacteria and ( in rare cases ) create the potential for toxic shock syndrome , but that issue is associated with the use of tampons rather than sanitary pads .

false	in late january 2019 , a chain message with the subject “ why does trump want this wall so badly ?” began to spread through inboxes , on social media , and on reddit . the answer , according to an anonymous author , was that “ the steel slats trump wants to use ... are manufactured in the u . s . by a steel mill co - owned by a russian - israeli billionaire named roman abramovich .”: <PARA> these three paragraphs blended factual statements about abramovich with unverified assertions to create a narrative at odds with reality . for this narrative to be true , each of the following statements would need to be true : <PARA> it is true that abramovich is a well - connected russian oligarch with some ties to the trump family , and it is true that abramovich owns the only mill in the united states capable of producing 480 - foot , steel rails ( a product touted for its utility in the train industry ). however , president trump , who has changed his view multiple times on what his wall should look like , has not once made “ 480 - foot steel rails ” an immutable part of that plan . this conspiracy theory hinges primarily on that final false assertion . <PARA> roman abramovich is a russian - israeli billionaire who , among other things , owns the chelsea premier league football club and is also the largest shareholder of the multinational , russian - based steel company evraz . after being granted israeli citizenship in may 2018 , abramovich became the world ’ s richest israeli . he is identified as a russian oligarch ( based on his “ closeness to the russian regime and ... net worth ”) and appears on a u . s . treasury list produced as part of sanctions legislation president trump reluctantly signed into law . abramovich ’ s presence on this list does not necessarily mean he is subject to u . s . sanctions , though . <PARA> abramovich is friendly with the trump family , mainly through his wife , dasha zhukova . in 2014 , ivanka trump and jared kushner spent four days in russia at the invitation of zhukova , where “ they sat at the same table along with a few other people during a high - powered fundraising dinner for moscow ’ s jewish museum ,” according to bloomberg . jared kushner , bloomberg reported , had also been invested in an art business whose founding partner was zhukova , and “ ivanka trump , kushner and his brother , joshua , have accompanied zhukova to sporting events in the new york area .” zhukova , a politico reporter noted , attended the trump inauguration as a guest of ivanka trump . <PARA> abramovich ’ s steel background has inspired past speculation about possible quid - pro - quos between the trump administration and russia , and it is likely that this current abramovich - border wall theory rests on the speculation caused by abramovich ’ s factual involvement in the keystone xl pipeline . <PARA> on 24 january 2017 , just days into his presidency , president trump signed two executive orders : the first order reversed president obama ’ s decision to revoke a permit for the keystone xl pipeline , and the second order mandated that , “ to the maximum extent permitted by law ,” the pipeline be made with steel “ produced in the united states .” <PARA> evraz had already produced 40 % of the steel for the existing sections of keystone xl , the climate - focused desmog blog reported , and terry cunha , a spokesperson for transcanada , which is behind keystone xl project , acknowledged to desmog that evraz stood to benefit if construction resumed on the pipeline . critics argued that the language in the “ manufactured in the usa ” executive order left significant room for evraz to be the likely supplier of steel for keystone xl should the project ever overcome its current legal hurdles , as evraz operates three steel mills in the united states . <PARA> those friendly relations , abramovich ’ s influence over the global steel market , and previous trump administration legislation beneficial to the oligarch ’ s interests created a strong factual base on which to build a flimsy fictional narrative . there is no question that any form of a border wall , regardless of design , will involve large quantities of steel which could theoretically be produced by a u . s .- based , evraz - owned steel mill . but the supposed “ smoking gun ” link in support of the notion that the steel it will have to produced by evraz is that president trump ’ s latest wall machination supposedly requires the use of “ 480 sq ft steel rails ” ( which we interpret to mean “ 480 - foot - long steel rails ”, as the latter is actually a real commodity ). <PARA> such a requirement would certainly be provocative , as it does appear that one evraz - owned steel mill in colorado is the only such facility within the united states capable of producing that length of rail . the train industry is quite interested in these super - long rail lengths , as they reduce the amount of welding required for track construction or repairs . in november 2006 , the denver post reported on evraz ’ s acquisition of the colorado - based rocky mountain steel company , stating that it would become the only american facility to produce those 480 - foot - length rail sections : <PARA> the only problem ? we have not identified a single instance of president trump ’ s stating a requirement that the border wall use 480 - foot - length steel rails , nor have we found any rationale for why such a length would be efficacious in border wall construction . trump ’ s descriptions of his proposed border wall have shifted repeatedly since it was first raised as a talking point on 5 august 2014 , and such descriptions have never been heavy on technical specifics . during most of the 2016 presidential campaign trump described his barrier as a concrete wall , but in an about - face he said in late 2018 that the wall would be made with “ artistically designed steel slats ,” tweeting a rudimentary design of such a “ steel slat barrier ” on 21 december 2018 : <PARA> using this schematic and some basic math , the washington post ‘ s philip bump calculated that the barrier proposed by president trump in this version of his plans would be built using 28 . 4 - feet - high by 10 - inch - wide steel slats with 13 - inch spikes on top , separated from each other by a 9 - inch gap . none of this , to our ears , screams “ 480 sq foot steel rails .” <PARA> the notion that trump and abramovich are corruptly colluding to provide a massive contract for a russian - based steel company via a steel southern border wall ( whose existence , let alone design , has yet to be approved in congress ) appears to be unfounded speculation rooted in a manufacturing requirement for the wall that trump never actually stated .

true	in november 2018 , the “ weird facts ” facebook page posted a widely - shared meme which outlined the death of joyce carol vincent , summarizing it as “ in 2006 , a woman ( joyce carol vincent ) was found in her london flat , skeletonized , after 3 years of being dead — with the tv still running ”: <PARA> notwithstanding the somewhat crass imagery used in the meme , this was unfortunately a largely accurate description of the tragic circumstances surrounding the death of joyce carol vincent , who did indeed remain undiscovered at home for around two years , dying around december 2003 . <PARA> according to material prepared for release to the news media by the metropolitan police , as well as reports by the bbc and the press association , the following are the known facts surrounding vincent ’ s demise . some readers might find the details disturbing . <PARA> on 26 january 2006 , vincent ’ s remains were discovered at her apartment in wood green , north - east london . workers from the metropolitan housing trust , an organization which provides affordable housing and is now known as metropolitan thames valley , had forced entry while attempting to inquire about thousands of pounds of unpaid rent arrears . vincent had been placed in the small apartment as part of a scheme for victims of domestic violence . <PARA> vincent ’ s remains were badly decomposed , and pathologist dr . simon poole later described them as being “ largely skeletal ,” which supports the claim made in the “ weird facts ” meme . according to evidence heard at a coroner ’ s inquest , vincent was found lying on her back on the floor of her living room next to a shopping bag and christmas presents which she had wrapped but never delivered . <PARA> her television was indeed still switched on when vincent was found . she was identified by reference to dental records . <PARA> based on the expiration dates of food and medication found in vincent ’ s flat , it was estimated that she had died around december 2003 , some two years earlier — not three years earlier , as the “ weird facts ” meme and several news reports mistakenly stated . she was born in london to grenadian immigrant parents in 1965 , and was 38 years old at the time of her death . <PARA> in the years after vincent was discovered , the filmmaker carol morley tracked down her friends , colleagues and associates . in interviews which would ultimately form the basis of the 2011 documentary film dreams of a life , those who knew vincent universally recalled their shock and disbelief at the circumstances of her death and discovery . <PARA> in the film some friends recounted actually having read news accounts of her death in april 2006 , but without an accompanying photograph , they did not connect the horrific circumstances of her discovery with the person they had known . <PARA> according to those accounts , vincent had for many years been a very social , popular professional young woman who worked in london ’ s fast - paced financial district in the 1980s and 1990s , was highly intelligent and charming , and was remarkably attractive and frequently the object of male attention . <PARA> vincent , who was at one time an aspiring singer , was acquainted with the soul vocalist betty wright , and had dinner with other iconic musical artists , including gil scott - heron , jimmy cliff , and ben e . king . in 1990 , vincent briefly met and conversed with nelson mandela backstage at a concert in london ’ s wembley stadium . <PARA> although she had many friends , vincent ’ s friendships appear to have been somewhat fleeting , and despite the deep affection in which she was held , she was known for “ drifting ” in and out of social groups and relationships and sometimes appeared troubled . her acquaintances recalled that she was distant towards her family members . <PARA> according to morley ’ s interviews with friends of vincent , she became engaged to marry an unidentified man in the late 1990s , and the metropolitan police later noted that she had been involved in a “ domestic incident ” in 1998 . in morley ’ s documentary , vincent ’ s friends observed that she was likely to have been in at least one abusive relationship during that time . <PARA> by 2001 , vincent left her job at the accounting firm ernst & young and progressively lost contact with her family members , friends and former colleagues , working for a time as a cleaner . <PARA> she changed addresses frequently but moved into her final apartment in wood green in february 2003 , having been placed there as part of a women ’ s refuge program for victims of domestic violence . her friends have speculated that she may have become isolated and withdrawn over time because she was ashamed of the abuse she had suffered and the shift in her professional and personal circumstances , and she may also have been avoiding detection by an abusive former partner . <PARA> in november 2003 , she was briefly hospitalized after vomiting blood and was diagnosed with a peptic ulcer . although she is believed to have died around a month later , the coroner was unable to arrive at a cause of death due to the decomposition of her remains by january 2006 . she also suffered from asthma , which was cited by her friends as a possible cause of death . <PARA> vincent did not take drugs or smoke and did not drink alcohol to excess . from the outset , the metropolitan police made it clear that they did not suspect foul play in her demise .

false	on 31 october 2018 , the facebook page “ hunter alerts ” was born , garnering just 40 followers in its first week of existence . so far , all that page has been used for is the distribution of two political advertisements asserting that “ if you vote in north dakota , you may forfeit hunting licenses you have in other states . if you want to keep your out - of - state hunting licenses , you may not want to vote in north dakota ”: <PARA> those ads were promoted by north dakota ’ s democratic party ( known as the democratic - nonpartisan league , or democratic - npl ) and linked back to that party ’ s website with a slightly more detailed explanation of the claim : <PARA> this statement , which was misleading for several reasons ( enumerated below ) and was provided with no additional information , citations , or exposition , was characterized by many critics as an attempt to suppress conservative votes in north dakota because it targets a demographic ( i . e ., hunters ) who traditionally lean conservative . ( north dakota also faces allegations of voter suppression efforts that target the more democrat - friendly native american population in that state .) <PARA> both the north dakota secretary of state and the north dakota game and fish department ( ngfd ) have told reporters they do not know what the ad was talking about . an ngfd representative told us via email that they “ cannot explain [ the ad ] and we have no desire to try to sort it out for [ the democratic - npl ]. we have had no involvement in the post .” <PARA> the most generous interpretation of the democratic - npl statement would be that the act of voting in north dakota , because it requires a state - issued north dakota id , means voters would necessarily be forfeiting claims to residency in any other states . many states offer both resident and non - resident hunting licenses , with the former coming at a cheaper cost but with proof - of - residency requirements . if , as the democratic - npl seemed to be arguing , one somehow obtained a resident hunting license in another state but actually lived and voted in north dakota , that other state could revoke their license if they found out you had declared residency somewhere else . ( the democratic - npl declined our request for comment ). <PARA> not only was this scenario far more specific than what was implied by the two - sentence statement promoted by the democratic - npl , but it also suggested an unrealistic level of inter - state bureaucratic communication whereby one state ’ s hunting licensure board actively communicated with the id - granting offices in every other state to make sure no one was receiving unwarranted license discounts . in most ( if not all ) cases , it was also simply inaccurate . as an example , we will present a scenario under which a wyoming resident legally obtains a resident hunting permit in that state and then moves and legally obtains residency ( and therefore voting rights ) in north dakota . <PARA> in wyoming , you must have resided in that state for at least one year , and during that time period you must not have been claiming residency for any other purpose in any other state ( emphasis ours ): <PARA> while several states stipulate you can no longer be considered a resident if you register to vote somewhere else , the requirements to receive a resident hunting license in wyoming and most other states is retrospective and not prospective . if a hypothetical wyoming resident switched jobs and moved to north dakota to work , their wyoming hunting license would already have been issued , and the state of wyoming would likely have no idea that person had moved . all that would be required for that individual to become a valid north dakota voter would be for that person to have maintained a residence in the state for 90 consecutive days and to have obtained an id card or driver ’ s license from north dakota ’ s department of transportation . <PARA> an additionally misleading aspect of the ad is the suggestion that the act of voting could pose a threat to out - of - state hunting licenses . “ if you want to keep your out - of - state hunting licenses ,” the democratic - npl states , you may not want to vote in north dakota ’ s 2018 election ” ( our emphasis added ). the only population of people this ad could possibly be relevant to are people who live in north dakota , have a resident hunting license in another state , and also do not have an up - to - date north dakota id or driver ’ s license . <PARA> by not providing those supporting details , the ad does nothing to correct the false notion an already legal north dakota voter ( i . e ., one already in possession of a state - issued id ) could put the legality of their theoretical out - of - state hunting licenses in jeopardy by going to the polls . the fact that this ad was released less than a week before the election also speaks poorly of its legitimacy . <PARA> the argument presented by the democratic - npl is based on a highly implausible scenario that has state hunting licensure boards actively and continually communicating with other state ’ s dot or dmv offices and would relate only ( if at all ) to a population of people who have claimed to be residents in other states for the purpose of obtaining discounted resident hunting licenses . even then , it would not be the act of voting that theoretically put out - of - state licenses at risk , but the act of obtaining the state - issued id required for voting .
false	the apocryphal tonight show incident with zsa zsa gabor and her cat is a wellspring for one of the greatest “ manufactured memories ” in modern popular culture . no matter how many millions of people swear they were watching the tonight show when the exchange below involving zsa zsa ’ s cat and johnny ’ s supposedly quick ( and dirty ) comeback took place , it simply didn ’ t happen : <PARA> although definitively disproving this claim is impossible since nearly all the tapes from the first decade of carson ’ s tenure as the tonight show ‘ s host [ 1962 - 1972 ] were erased or discarded , other available evidence ( or lack thereof ) is sufficient to justify assigning this legend its apocryphal status : <PARA> as a final piece of negative evidence , consider that both zsa zsa gabor and johnny carson have denied that this incident ever took place , in letters to us reproduced below and in the following exchange between johnny and jane fonda during a 1989 tonight show appearance : <PARA> those who insist this incident really did happen often claim that carson and gabor ’ s denials mean nothing , because they were required to issue them under the terms of settlement agreed to after the actress sued the talk show host . however , being embarrassed on television isn ’ t valid grounds for a lawsuit , as the los angeles times noted in an article on the controversy surrounding the popular 2006 “ mockumentary ” film borat : <PARA> ( it ’ s also rather improbable that if zsa zsa were so offended by the alleged remark as to bring suit against johnny carson , she would have continued to appear on his show over the years , or that johnny would have invited her back in the first place .) <PARA> this legend almost certainly started out as a generic joke , with real - life participants later added to the tale to lend it additional humor and credibility . eventually , public perception deemed johnny carson the celebrity most likely to make such a quip , so the punchline was put in his mouth . ( in earlier days , the payoff line would undoubtedly have been credited to groucho marx .) zsa zsa gabor , the epitome of the sexy , pampered celebrity , more famous for her multiple marriages and her full figure than her talents , was cast as the straight woman , and as her popularity waned in later years ( unlike johnny ’ s ), a series of female sex symbols replaced her in the role . <PARA> we sent inquiries to both carson and gabor about this legend back in the 1990s , and both responded and stated that the event described never took place .

false	each year , a few days before thanksgiving , the president of the united states formally pardons a live turkey presented to him by the national turkey federation ( ntf ), and this ceremony has become a white house tradition which is annually covered by the press . of recent years , news stories about the annual bestowment of clemency on the presidential gobbler have often asserted the tradition began in 1947 , with president harry truman first pardoning a bird . <PARA> lamentably , the press have often explained the tradition wrongly . president truman was neither the first u . s . president to pardon a turkey ( he didn ’ t pardon any of the birds presented to him ), nor did the modern annual tradition begin with him . <PARA> let ’ s dispose of the truman - related claims first , because they ’ re the easiest to deal with . while it is true the national turkey federation has been supplying an annual holiday bird to the white house since 1947 ( which was when truman was in office ), nothing in the record of the truman presidency supports the notion that any of the birds so provided was spared by that first family . indeed , the official record keeper of that presidency , the truman library , says it has been unable to locate anything that would serve to connect president truman with the pardoning of turkeys : <PARA> by the way , the turkey provided to the first family in 1947 by the ntf was a christmas bird , handed over on 15 december 1947 . <PARA> as to who spared the first presidential gobbler , one charming bit of folklore lays that honor at the feet of abraham lincoln . supposedly , his ten - year - old son , tad lincoln , christened as “ jack ” a bird given to honest abe in 1863 and was therefore less than delighted by the prospect of having his feathered friend served up on a platter at the family ’ s christmas feast . the boy , it is said , burst into one of his father ’ s cabinet meetings to plead for the bird ’ s life , a request lincoln agreed to . but the tale doesn ’ t end there : on election day in 1864 , lincoln spied jack at his polling place at the white house and demanded of tad , “ what business has the turkey stalking about the polls in that way ? does he vote ?” “ no ,” said tad . “ he ’ s not of age .” ( other accounts maintain that jack was not a turkey at all , but rather a soldier doll sent to tad by the sanitary commission in new york . during a play session with friends the lincoln boys accused jack of military misbehavior and then sought a pardon for him from their father , who obligingly wrote them a note stating that “ the doll jack is pardoned by order of the president .”) <PARA> the passage of time , the dearth of well - maintained news archives contemporaneous to that presidency , plus the fact that so many of the homespun “ honest abe ” tales in common circulation have turned out to be lore as opposed to factual reportings of actual occurrences leaves us unable to say yea or nay to the anecdote . however , even if it were to emerge that the lincoln story were a relatively reliable account of an actual event , though it might establish that a bird meant for the presidential table was spared , at no point did anyone use the word “ pardon .” <PARA> the earliest provable instance of the word “ pardon ” being used in connection with a presidential holiday bird attaches to a gobbler given in 1963 by the california turkey advisory board to president john f . kennedy . however , kennedy did not pardon the creature presented to him in the rose garden on 18 november 1963 ; he merely announced he didn ’ t plan to eat the bird . newspapers nevertheless reported the following day the bird had been “ pardoned .” <PARA> the first president to use a form of the word “ pardon ” in connection with a turkey was president ronald reagan in 1987 , but even then he wasn ’ t granting a stay of execution to a bird at risk of being eaten ; he was deflecting with humor some questions posed by the media that he did not want to answer . reagan parried queries about whether he would pardon iran - contra figures lt . col . oliver north and former national security adviser john poindexter by joking that if that year ’ s turkey had not been destined for a petting farm , “ i would have pardoned him .” <PARA> surprisingly , this tradition which now everyone remembers as having gone on forever apparently began with president george h . w . bush in 1989 . at that year ’ s thanksgiving presentation of a bird for the first family ’ s table , in his remarks to those assembled , he said , “ but let me assure you — and this fine tom turkey — that he will not end up on anyone ’ s dinner table . not this guy . he ’ s been granted a presidential pardon as of right now , allowing him to live out his days on a farm not far from here .” <PARA> president george h . w . bush bestowed subsequent poultripital pardons on thanksgiving birds in each succeeding year of his presidency , thereby establishing the tradition . <PARA> the national turkey and the alternate national turkey ( designated in case the national bird can ’ t fulfill his duties ) both receive pardons that spare them from becoming anyone ’ s dinner and go on to live out their natural lives in petting zoos or on farms . however , those granted such reprieves generally fail to live for long ; they usually succumb within a year of their pardons . fast - growing , commercially - raised turkeys tend to expire fairly quickly , as they grow too large for their body structure and are too susceptible to disease . <PARA> sightings : in an episode of television ’ s the west wing (“ shibboleth ,” original air date 22 november 2000 ), press secretary c . j . cregg is given the unenviable task of selecting which of the two turkeys presented to the white house will be pardoned by the president .
false	while several online fabrications were designed to elicit anger against former pro football star colin kaepernick (“ satirically ” or otherwise ) after the announcement of his inclusion in a nike ad campaign , at least one fake item rebuked consumers who professed a desire to burn their own nike apparel in protest against kaepernick and the sportswear company . <PARA> in september 2018 a popular facebook post proffered an alleged “ response from nike ” regarding the angry outcry that followed their announcement that kaepernick would be featured in the ad campaign marking the 30th anniversary of the nike slogan “ just do it ”: <PARA> at least one user who shared the post claimed that they found the text posted on the public relations web site prweb , but that the notice had since been deleted . a staff member for prweb referred us to nike but would not comment further . but no such statement was ever spotted or archived from nike ’ s social media accounts , and the company confirmed to us via email that it did not originate with them . <PARA> the mention of people “ burning ” their nike apparel could be a reference to separate pictures that spread online claiming to show a person burning his nike shoes while wearing them . in reality , though , that picture set was a hoax posted by a twitter user who employed a photograph of some other foot burn patient . <PARA> the claim that veterans comprise “ nearly a fifth of all homeless people ” does not match up with federal data . according to the department of housing and urban development , the u . s . homeless veteran population increased in 2017 to an estimated 40 , 000 people . but that figure constitutes far less than 20 percent of the overall homeless population , which is estimated to be around 554 , 000 people . <PARA> kaepernick has been the subject of right - wing criticism since he began “ taking a knee ” during the playing of the national anthem before games in protest of extrajudicial killings on the part of police , a move that he undertook at the suggestion of a u . s . army veteran and former national football league player , nate boyer . <PARA> after kaepernick generated another round of controversy by announcing that he would be part of the nike campaign , “ reports ” from spurious web sites claimed that the company had quickly dumped him ; that nike lost contracts with both the university of alabama and the federal government ; and that pro basketball hall - of - famer michael jordan pulled his signature air jordan brand from the company . <PARA> while president donald trump has claimed that nike was suffering because of a purported boycott incited by the kaepernick ad campaign , social media data reportedly showed a lack of “ a strong negative call ” against the company . <PARA> on 5 september 2018 , nike released a two - minute tv commercial voiced by kaepernick that aired during the 2017 season premiere of thursday night football a day later .
mixture	in may and june 2017 , an assortment of web sites that share a history of posting unreliable information published a report stating that japanese authorities had announced plans to dispose of nuclear wastewater from the disabled fukushima daiichi nuclear plant in the pacific ocean — a claim that is at odds with mainstream news reporting on the topic , including the source cited by the article itself . <PARA> for example , yournewswire . com ’ s story began : <PARA> citing a televised interview with a u . k . engineering expert on an april 2017 segment of a news program on trt world ( turkish radio and television corporation ’ s international news channel ), the report continued : <PARA> however , note the discrepancy between the statement attributed to whitby directly above and the article ’ s opening paragraph , which said : “ japan has announced plans to dump 920 , 000 tons of deadly fukushima nuclear waste into the pacific ocean .” <PARA> here is a transcript of whitby ’ s exact words : <PARA> whitby didn ’ t say the japanese had announced they ’ re doing it ; he said the japanese were beginning to talk about doing it . his remarks were apparently informed by a new york times report published the month before saying japanese officials were debating dumping fukushima wastewater into the sea : <PARA> it appears japan has been considering this measure for quite some time . according to an article in the wall street journal , shunichi tanaka , chairman of japan ’ s nuclear regulation authority , called on tokyo electric power company ( tepco ) in 2015 to “ work toward discharging low - level contaminated water into the ocean from the fukushima daiichi nuclear plant .” the international atomic energy agency made the same recommendation two years before that , stipulating that tepco would have to conduct safety and environmental assessments first , and the nuclear regulation authority would have to review them . <PARA> the iaea maintains that such a release would not only be safe ( because the radioactive water would be diluted to a level regarded as unharmful ), but that it is consistent with standard practice : <PARA> for good or ill , it may well come to pass that contaminated water from fukushima daiichi will be diluted and dumped into the pacific ocean , because no one has yet come up with a better solution for dealing with radioactive leakage from the plant . unless it is already being done in secret , however , as of june 2017 , it is still a proposed solution to a nearly intractable problem .
unproven	i saw an article in a news paper about the deadly redback spider being in the uk . it was headlined with “ killer toilet spider warning : dad dies from deadly redback bite ” alot of people on facebook are freaking out so i just wanted to see if it ’ s true or false . <PARA> origins : in august 2014 social media networks were abuzz with reprinted versions of a typically sensationalized sun article (“ yes , the deadly redback spider is already in britain — and could be lurking under your toilet seat ”) about a 48 - year - old man named john francis kennedy in cork , ireland , who reportedly was bitten on the neck by a “ poisonous red - back ” spider while watching a movie at home and died of “ massive internal bleeding ”: <PARA> his wife jeanne insists that his death was the result of a spider bite he got last year — and her description matches that of the deadly redback , which is one of the few spiders that can be seriously harmful to humans . <PARA> sometimes known as the ‘ toilet spider ’, redbacks can be commonly found living under toilet seats . <PARA> the redback spider ( latrodectus hasseltii , also known as the red - striped spider , red - spot spider , and jockey spider ) is a species of venomous spider indigenous to australia , that typically lives in warm , sheltered locations , often in or around human dwellings . the redback is one of the few spider species whose bite does pose a significant risk to humans , as its venom can produce pain , muscle rigidity , vomiting , and sweating , and in some cases death : <PARA> she is a relative of the black widow ; only the red dorsal stripe distinguishes them . <PARA> redbacks are found everywhere throughout the australian continent , especially alongside human habitation . <PARA> only females build webs . their smaller , less brilliantly colored male counterparts often lurk to the side . <PARA> humans must be careful . the spider won ’ t seek out people to sting , but should a hand stray into her web by accident , a trip to the emergency room may be in order as the venom acts directly on the nerves . <PARA> only the female bite is dangerous , and their bites have caused some human deaths . <PARA> the redback possesses a potent neurotoxic venom . it does not hunt its prey , but instead waits for a tasty morsel to wander by and become entangled in its web . <PARA> once the prey - usually a walking insect - becomes enmeshed in the redback ’ s web , it ’ s wrapped in silk . when it ’ s time to eat , the spider bites down on its intended victim , injecting its neurotoxic venom . the venom paralyzes the insect , and digestive enzymes begin to dissolve the prey ’ s insides . <PARA> antivenom for redback spider bites has been available since 1956 , and no known deaths directly attributable to redback bites have been documented in more than fifty years since then , which makes this latest case in ireland quite a subject of interest . however , note that the victim ’ s wife , jeanne , stated her husband didn ’ t die soon after being bitten by a spider ; he had actually been bitten a year earlier , and then he experienced a long period of declining health with various symptoms before finally passing away in july 2014 : <PARA> “ but the bite he got had bled very badly . we went through a roll and a half of toilet roll to try and stop it . <PARA> “ ever since his health went down . <PARA> “ his stomach started swelling , they said it was his liver and his pancreas . <PARA> “ his testicles also swelled up very bad .” <PARA> jeanne , 46 , went on to describe how john ’ s eyesight deteriorated and he started vomiting blood . <PARA> he eventually died in hospital last month and an inquest into his death has begun — but jeanne is already convinced it was the spider . <PARA> “ it had to be down to that sting . <PARA> “ he was in perfect health before the bite happened .” <PARA> so there ’ s as yet no certainty that john francis kennedy was actually bitten by a redback spider , which had not previously been sighted in ireland , other than someone ’ s year - old recollection of what the spider in question looked like . and even if that species of spider did deliver a bite to the victim , it ’ s unproven at this point that his death was directly attributable to that bite . he may have died from something else completely coincidental to that bite , he may have been suffering from an undiagnosed medical condition that had already compromised his health and was exacerbated or compounded by the bite ’ s effects , or he may have suffered an allergic reaction to the bite ( rather than being killed by the venom itself ) — a host of alternative explanations are possible . <PARA> until additional ( and less tabloid - sensational ) details are provided about this case , it ’ s far too early to claim this as a verified example of a redback spider bite death in ireland . and for those locals who fear that such critters are taking up residence in the area : <PARA> currently there are no national records of redback spider sightings .
true	actor and director clint eastwood has long been critical of the left in american politics , and is considered as an icon by some on the right for being one of the rare outspoken political conservatives in hollywood . as a result , his words ( or at least close approximations of them ) often appear on pro - trump facebook pages . <PARA> one entry from the “ close approximation ” camp is found in a meme posted the facebook group “ donald trump for president 2020 !!!!!!” that purportedly reproduced an eastwood comment about president obama : <PARA> although clint eastwood did not say these words exactly as stated in the meme , they appear to be a reasonably close paraphrase of comments he gave to the carmel pine cone ( the local newspaper of the california town for which eastwood once served as mayor ) following his controversial and meandering improvised “ empty chair ” speech at the 2012 republican national convention . in that article , eastwood reflected on the criticism of his speech ( emphasis ours ): <PARA> although the meme added some text and replaced “ hoax ” with “ fraud ” and “ the obama presidency ” with “ president obama ,” the primary meaning remained unchanged .
true	origins : the bespectacled , bearded fellow shown in the second row of photographs above is “ bear man ” charlie vandergaw , a 68 - year - old former science teacher who resides on a homestead in the yentna river valley , fifty miles northwest of anchorage , alaska . <PARA> as the anchorage daily news reported of him : <PARA> what goes on each summer at vandergaw ’ s remote homestead is so far from the ordinary as to be almost unbelievable . visitors tell of him petting black and brown bears , playing with grizzly cubs while sows stand by , sitting on bears and teaching them tricks . his own photographs show even more . they capture him easing to within feet of breeding grizzlies and nursing an injured brown bear . <PARA> a visiting photographer is amazed to see head - and - shoulder shots of breeding grizzlies taken with a wide - angle lens — photos that would require the photographer to be within feet , if not inches , of the bears . <PARA> there are photos of vandergaw playing with grizzly cubs while their mother lounges nearby . there are pictures of gangs of bears around his cabin , of individual bears in his cabin , and even close - ups of a grizzly ’ s injured mouth . <PARA> it might all seem unbelievable if not for the fact that his photos are confirmed , in effect , by those taken by other photographers and by the black bear wandering around the yard . <PARA> a visiting photographer is amazed to see head - and - shoulder shots of breeding grizzlies taken with a wide - angle lens — photos that would require the photographer to be within feet , if not inches , of the bears . <PARA> there are photos of vandergaw playing with grizzly cubs while their mother lounges nearby . there are pictures of gangs of bears around his cabin , of individual bears in his cabin , and even close - ups of a grizzly ’ s injured mouth . <PARA> it might all seem unbelievable if not for the fact that his photos are confirmed , in effect , by those taken by other photographers and by the black bear wandering around the yard . <PARA> vandergaw says his relationship with bears dates to his retirement from teaching in 1985 . over the years he has fed bears , befriended bears , nursed injured bears back to <PARA> health , and allowed bears inside his cabin ; now it is not unusual to find several black and brown bears lounging around his “ bear farm ” yard on any given day . wildlife officials have been critical of vandergaw ’ s activities , maintaining that he ( and his human visitors ) risk an eventual mauling by the bruins , and that his conditioning the creatures to become used to a human presence and to seek handouts of food puts the bears at risk of being shot as dangerous pests . ( vandergaw maintains that the bears are not his “ pets ” and that they “ know better than to demand food from people .”) <PARA> in april 2010 , vandergaw was fined $ 20 , 000 for violating alaska state law by feeding wild bears . in addition to the hefty fine , his sentence included three years probation , but no jail time .
mixture	in the waning years of their lengthy lives , former presidents ( and founding fathers ) john adams and thomas jefferson reconciled the political differences that had separated them for many years and carried on a voluminous correspondence . one of the purposes behind their exchange of letters was to set the record straight regarding the events of the american revolution , for as author joseph j . ellis noted , they ( particularly adams , whom history would not treat nearly as kindly as jefferson ) were keenly aware of the “ distinction between history as experienced and history as remembered ”: <PARA> evidently adams was right : so great is our need for simplified , dramatic events and heroes that even the real - life biographies of the fifty - six men who risked their lives to publicly declare american independence are no longer compelling enough . through multiple versions of pieces like the one quoted below , their lives have been repeatedly embellished with layers of fanciful fiction to make for a better story : <PARA> as we often do , we ’ ll try here to strip away those accumulated layers of fiction and get down to whatever kernel of truth may lie underneath : <PARA> it is true that five signers of the declaration of independence were captured by the british during the course of the revolutionary war . however , none of them died while a prisoner , and four of them were taken into custody not because they were considered “ traitors ” due to their status as signatories to that document , but because they were captured as prisoners of war while actively engaged in military operations against the british . <PARA> george walton was captured after being wounded while commanding militia at the battle of savannah in december 1778 , and thomas heyward , jr ., arthur middleton , and edward rutledge ( three of the four declaration of independence signers from south carolina ) were taken prisoner at the siege of charleston in may in 1780 . although they endured the ill treatment typically afforded to prisoners of war during their captivity ( prison conditions were quite deplorable at the time ), they were not tortured , nor is there evidence that they were treated more harshly than other wartime prisoners who were not also signatories to the declaration . moreover , all four men were eventually exchanged or released ; had they been considered traitors by the british , they would have been hanged . <PARA> richard stockton of new jersey was the only signer taken prisoner specifically because of his status as a signatory to the declaration , “ dragged from his bed by night ” by local tories after he had evacuated his family from new jersey , and imprisoned in new york city ’ s infamous provost jail like a common criminal . <PARA> it is true that a number of signers saw their homes and property occupied , ransacked , looted , and vandalized by the british ( and even in some cases by the americans ). however , as we discuss in more detail below , this activity was a common part of warfare . signers ’ homes were not specifically targeted for destruction — like many other americans , their property was subject to seizure when it fell along the path of a war being waged on the north american continent . <PARA> abraham clark of new jersey saw two of his sons captured by the british and incarcerated on the prison ship jersey . john witherspoon , also of new jersey , saw his eldest son , james , killed in the battle of germantown in october 1777 . if there was a second signer of the declaration whose son was killed while serving in the continental army , we have yet to identify him . <PARA> this statement is quite misleading as phrased . nine signers died during the course of the revolutionary war , but none of them died from wounds or hardships inflicted on them by the british . ( indeed , several of the nine didn ’ t even take part in the war .) only one signer , button gwinnett of georgia , died from wounds , and those were received not at the hands of the british , but from a fellow officer with whom he dueled in may 1777 . <PARA> before the american revolution , carter braxton was possessed of a considerable fortune through inheritance and favorable marriages . while still in his teens he inherited the family estate , which included a flourishing virginia tobacco plantation , upon the death of his father . he married a wealthy heiress who died when he was just 21 , and within a few years he had remarried , this time to the daughter of the receiver of customs in virginia for the king . as a delegate representing virginia in the continental congress in 1776 , he was one of the minority of delegates reluctant to support an american declaration of independence , a move which he viewed at the time as too dangerous : <PARA> braxton invested his wealth in commercial enterprises , particularly shipping , and he endured severe financial reversals during the revolutionary war when many of the ships in which he held interest were either appropriated by the british government ( because they were british - flagged ) or were sunk or captured by the british . he was not personally targeted for ruin because he had signed the declaration of independence , however ; he suffered grievous financial losses because most of his wealth was tied up in shipping , “ that trade which is so essential to the prosecution of the war ” and which was therefore a prime military target for the british . even if he hadn ’ t signed the declaration of independence , braxton ’ s ships would have been casualties of the war just the same . <PARA> although braxton did lose property during the war and had to sell off assets ( primarily landholdings ) to cover the debts incurred by the loss of his ships , he recouped much of that money after the war but subsequently lost it again through his own ill - advised business dealings . his fortune was considerably diminished in his later years , but he did not by any stretch of the imagination “ die in rags .” <PARA> as one biography describes thomas mckean ( not “ mckeam ”): <PARA> among his many offices , mckean was a delegate to the continental congress ( of which he later served as president ), president of delaware , chief justice of pennsylvania , and governor of pennsylvania . the above - quoted statement regarding his being “ hounded ” by the british during the revolutionary war is probably based upon a letter he wrote to his friend john adams in 1777 , in which he described how he had been “ hunted like a fox by the enemy , compelled to remove my family five times in three months , and at last fixed them in a little log - house on the banks of the susquehanna , but they were soon obliged to move again on account of the incursions of the indians .” <PARA> however , it is problematic to assert that mckean ’ s treatment was due to his being a signer of the declaration of independence . ( his name does not appear on printed copies of that document authenticated in january 1777 , so it is likely he did not affix his name to it until later .) if he was targeted by the british , it was quite possibly because he also served in a military capacity as a volunteer leader of militia . in any case , mckean did not end up in “ poverty ,” as the estate he left behind when he died in 1817 was described as consisting of “ stocks , bonds , and huge land tracts in pennsylvania .” <PARA> first of all , this passage has a couple of misspellings : the signers referred to are william ellery ( not “ dillery ”) and edward rutledge ( not “ ruttledge ”). secondly , this sentence is misleading in that it implies a motive that was most likely not present ( i . e ., these men ’ s homes were looted because they had been signers of the declaration of independence ). <PARA> the need to forage for supplies in enemy territory has long been a part of warfare , and so it was far from uncommon for british soldiers in the field to appropriate such material from private residences during the american revolution . ( not only were homes used as sources of food , livestock , and other necessary supplies , but larger houses were also taken over and used to quarter soldiers or to serve as headquarters for officers .) in some cases , even american forces took advantage of the local citizenry to provision themselves . given that many more prominent american revolutionaries who were also signers of the declaration of independence ( e . g ., samuel adams , john hancock , benjamin franklin , james wilson , benjamin rush , robert morris ) had homes in areas that were occupied by the british during the war , yet those homes were not looted or vandalized , it ’ s hard to make the case that the men named above were specifically targeted for vengeance by the british rather than unfortunate victims whose property fell in the path of an armed conflict being waged on american soil . <PARA> the tale about thomas nelson ’ s urging or suggesting the bombardment of his own house is one of several revolutionary war legends whose truth may never be known . several versions of this story exist , one of which ( as referenced above ) holds that nelson encouraged george washington to shell his yorktown home after british major general charles cornwallis had taken it over to use as his headquarters in 1781 : <PARA> other versions of the story have nelson directing the marquis de lafayette to train french artillery on his home : <PARA> still other accounts maintain this legend is a conflation of two separate events : thomas nelson , acting as commander in chief of the virginia militia , ordered a battery to open fire on his uncle ’ s home , where cornwallis was then ensconced . later , nelson supposedly made a friendly bet with french artillerists in which he challenged them to hit his home , one of the more prominent landmarks in yorktown . <PARA> whatever the truth , the nelson home was certainly not “ destroyed ” as claimed . the house stands to this day as part of colonial national historical park , and the national park service ’ s description of it notes only that “ the southeast face of the residence does show evidence of damage from cannon fire .” <PARA> francis lewis represented new york in the continental congress , and shortly after he signed the declaration of independence his long island estate was raided by the british , possibily as retaliation for his having been a signatory to that document . while lewis was in philadelphia attending to congressional matters , his wife was taken prisoner by the british after disregarding an order for citizens to evacuate long island . mrs . lewis was held for several months before being exchanged for the wives of british officials captured by the americans . although her captivity was undoubtedly a hardship , she had already been in poor health for some time and died a few years ( not months ) later . <PARA> john hart ’ s new jersey farm was looted in the course of the revolutionary war ( possibly due his status as speaker of the assembly ), and he did have to remain in hiding in nearby mountains for a short time , but the rest of the above passage is gross exaggeration . when the british overran the area of new jersey where hart resided in late november of 1776 , he was not “ driven from his [ dying ] wife ’ s bedside ,” as his wife had already died several weeks earlier ( and most of his thirteen children were adults by then ). he certainly didn ’ t spend “ more than a year ” on the run living “ in forests and caves ,” as the continental army recaptured the area within a month ( through general george washington ’ s famous crossing of the delaware river on christmas night ). hart also did not die “ from exhaustion and a broken heart ” a mere “ few weeks ” after emerging from hiding — in 1778 he was re - elected to the new jersey assembly , and he invited the american army to encamp on his new jersey farmland in june 1778 before succumbing to kidney stones in may 1779 . <PARA> lewis morris ( not norris ) indeed saw his westchester county , new york , home taken over in 1776 and used as a barracks for soldiers , and the horses and livestock from his farm commandeered by military personnel , but he suffered those initial deprivations at the hands of the continental army , not the british . shortly afterwards his property was appropriated , looted , and burned by the british when they occupied new york . ( morris and his wife were eventually able to reclaim their property and restore their home after the war .) <PARA> philip livingston lost several properties to the british occupation of new york and sold off others to support the war effort , and he did not recover them because he died suddenly in 1778 , before the end of the war .

false	in september 2017 , rumors emerged on social media that a 2005 movie predicted current events by featuring two hurricanes named harvey and irma — and that this somehow proved that the hurricanes were both human - engineered . <PARA> a typical viral message read as follows : <PARA> category 7 : end of the world was a two - part made - for - tv movie broadcast by cbs in november 2005 . it ’ s an apocalyptic thriller directed by dick lowry and starring shannon doherty about a series of extreme weather events that cause destruction around the world . <PARA> in the movie , a hurricane named eduardo strikes florida and washington , d . c ., while an unnamed category 6 storm hits new york . eventually the two combine , causing the movie ’ s eponymous category 7 storm , which threatens a global catastrophe . <PARA> none of the storms or hurricanes in the movie was named harvey or irma . furthermore , category 7 : end of the world was broadcast in november 2005 , which was 11 years and 10 months ( not nine months ) before hurricane irma ’ s expected landfall in florida on 10 september 2017 . so the meme ’ s two key claims were false . <PARA> however , even if these claims were accurate , they would have no sinister meaning . <PARA> atlantic hurricanes are named from a prescribed list of names that are rotated every six years and published in advance . so we already know the list of potential hurricane names for 2018 , 2019 , and every year for the foreseeable future , unless they are changed by the world meteorological association . <PARA> there was a hurricane harvey , for example , in 2011 and a tropical storm harvey in 2005 and 1999 . had the filmmakers named their fictional storms harvey or irma , they could easily have chosen them from the same publicly available list . <PARA> even if there had been 11 years and 9 months between the original broadcast of category 7 : end of the world , and hurricane irma ’ s expected landfall , this would be a meaningless coincidence . <PARA> to believe otherwise requires believing a vast , unfeasibly complicated conspiracy theory involving the movie ’ s writers , directors , cbs , and the federal government , who would then have to engineer and manage a tropical storm into a powerful hurricane ( something that is impossible ) and time its development to perfection so that it makes landfall in the united states on 11 september 2017 exactly . <PARA> in reality , hurricane irma is expected to hit the continental u . s . on 10 september 2017 . <PARA> however , again , even if the post had gotten the dates right , the idea that they contain significance is an example of cherry - picking numerical patterns ( which exist everywhere ) and contorting them to fit pre - existing beliefs and theories . we have addressed such pattern - seeking previously , in the context of both hurricanes and terrorist attacks . <PARA> the “ category 7 ” meme consists of a ludicrous conspiracy theory based on evidence - free claims about government “ geoengineering ” and numerology , and ignores the fact that hurricane names are made public years in advance . furthermore , its two key factual claims – that the hurricanes in the movie were named harvey and irma , and that the movie was released 11 years and nine months ago – are false .
false	on 8 august 2016 , the web site young cons posted via social media the claim that democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton had “ refused ” to congratulate ginny thrasher , the shooter who took home team usa ’ s first gold medal in the 2016 summer olympics . <PARA> young cons used a less abrasive and slightly more accurate title — “ hillary congratulates hijab wearing american olympian for competing , ignores female who wins gold in air rifle ” — for the headline of the underlying article ( which implied the lack of recognition had something to do with thrasher ’ s sport involving the use of a gun ). <PARA> although hillary clinton ’ s twitter account issued an informational post about fencer ibtihaj muhammad , the first american muslim to compete while wearing a hijab , the clinton account has not posted anything about thrasher : <PARA> as of this writing the united states has won five gold medals at the 2016 olympics , and clinton has only tweeted about one of those winners , swimmer katie ledecky , who set a world record in the 400m freestyle : <PARA> ( the style of clinton ’ s olympics - related twitter posts suggests they may be keyed to images prepared in advance of the games to recognize selected athletes or anticipated winners . the graphic for the katie ledecky tweet , for example , referred to ledecky as an “ olympic gold medalist and world record holder ,” a status she held before the start of the rio olympics , but made no reference to the specific event she won in the 2016 games .) <PARA> it is also worth noting that republican presidential nominee donald trump ’ s twitter account likewise did not issue any congratulations to thrasher . as of this writing , the only trump tweet about the 2016 olympic games has been a “ good luck ” message to all of america ’ s athletes : <PARA> of course , it ’ s inaccurate to say that either hillary clinton or donald trump “ refused ” to congratulate thrasher or “ ignored ” her accomplishments . team usa is expected to claim dozens more gold medals ( they took home 46 in 2012 ) at the 2016 rio olympics , and it ’ s unlikely that either candidate will mention each of those athletes by name on social media in the midst of a busy presidential campaign .

false	on 13 august 2018 , president trump visited wheeler - sack army air field at fort drum , new york , for a ceremonial signing of the john mccain national defense authorization act , a $ 717 billion military spending bill for fiscal year 2019 . <PARA> in addition to funding increases in troop strength , equipment upgrades , and modernization , the bill included a 2 . 6 percent pay raise for service members ( the highest increase in nine years ), as well as a 3 . 4 percent increase in basic subsistence allowance and a 2 . 9 percent increase in basic housing allowance . <PARA> before the official signing took place , trump spoke to the assembled troops of the 10th mountain division , whom he complimented on their valor and dedication . “ you ’ re not just tough , you ’ re mountain tough , you ’ re mountain proud , and you ’ re mountain strong , ever climbing to glory ,” he told them . <PARA> but something else trump allegedly said drew way more attention on social media . after announcing the increase , he supposedly told the troops that if they were “ real patriots ,” they would turn down the pay raise : <PARA> some posts on twitter and facebook included a short video clip from the speech : <PARA> a full transcript and video of president trump ’ s speech and the signing ceremony are also available . one thing they make clear is that the president did not utter the words , “ if soldiers were real patriots , they wouldn ’ t take a pay raise .” it isn ’ t a direct quote . <PARA> here is the relevant passage from the official white house transcript of the speech : <PARA> in context , it ’ s obvious that the president was teasing the soldiers , not literally questioning their patriotism . his improvised remarks were clearly intended as a joke , even if some listeners might have considered it to be a rather lame one . <PARA> many of the commenters who acknowledged that it was a joke felt it was a disrespectful one , though . and at least one tweet accused trump of “ mocking ” the troops : <PARA> but again , the criticism seemed to presume that at some level president trump seriously doubted his audience ’ s patriotism . it bears pointing out that this wasn ’ t the first time he had ribbed u . s . soldiers about wanting a pay raise . during a speech he delivered a few months earlier in which he took credit for a 2 . 4 percent military pay hike in fiscal 2018 ( which he erroneously claimed was the first increase in 10 years ), trump feigned uncertainty as to how soon the troops would like to see another such raise : <PARA> although trump didn ’ t mention patriotism that time , the form of the joke was reminiscent of the one he would later make at fort dodd , right down to answering his own tongue - in - cheek question with “ i don ’ t know .” this is typical of trump ’ s deadpan , sometimes awkward improvisational style . <PARA> arguably , then , what some have interpreted as a slight against u . s . service members ’ patriotism can be interpreted with equal validity as a clumsy attempt at irony — although the only point on which most observers are likely to agree is that it wasn ’ t particularly funny .
false	phillips , [ captain ] smith , and bride all laughed together , and at 12 : 45 a . m . april 15 , 1912 , the titanic sent out the first sos in history . <PARA> origins : one trait of human nature is that we tend to embellish notable achievements by associating them with important people and momentous events . if a memorable quote comes out of the mouth of an obscure person , we inevitably attribute his words to someone more famous ( hence historical and literary figures such as abraham lincoln and mark twain have been given credit over the years for <PARA> originating hundreds of witty and pithy sayings they never uttered ). if we can ’ t pin down exactly when a new invention was first used , we often tie that usage to an <PARA> event of some historical significance ( such as a war or the aftermath of a disaster ). <PARA> the sinking of the titanic was certainly one of the more momentous events of the twentieth century , and one of the enduring images of titanic mythology is that of the senior wireless operator , jack phillips , hunched over his telegraph key , desperately tapping out distress signals until the very last <PARA> moment . even after released from duty by his captain , phillips remained at his post and continued to transmit without regard for his personal safety , stopping only <PARA> when the titanic ‘ s power finally failed and he could send no more . by then it was too late : all the lifeboats were long gone , and the titanic was only minutes away from her final plunge into the sea . phillips did not survive . <PARA> naturally , then , we want to imbue the death of jack phillips and the loss of titanic with some extra significance , and one of the manifestations of that desire is the origination of the claim that the titanic was the first ship to use sos as a distress call . that claim is an erroneous one , however — a chimera passed along by writer after writer who accepted it as true . <PARA> in 1912 , one might have said that if marine wireless communication was no longer in its infancy , it certainly wasn ’ t very far into adolescence . rival wireless companies from different countries often refused to relay each other ’ s messages ( except for emergency situations ), and international standards for such important <PARA> matters as ship identification and distress signals had not been enacted . a 1906 international conference on wireless communication at sea held in berlin attempted to sort out some of these issues , including the standardization of the call letters to be used by ships in distress . at the time , british wireless operators generally used the call letters cqd as a distress signal : cq representing the general call for other ships in the area ( i . e ., “ seek you ”), with a d added at the end to signify “ danger ” ( followed by the latitude and longitude of the ship in distress ). the germans disliked this method and countered by proposing soe , but this <PARA> offering was rejected because the final e ( represented by a single dot in morse code ) could too easily be lost in transmission . <PARA> the solution the conference finally settled upon was the signal sos , its dot - dot - dot - dash - dash - dash - dot - dot - dot forming a distinctive pattern that even novice wireless operators could easily recognize and transmit . contrary to persistent belief , the letters sos were chosen simply due their ease of transmission , not because they represented “ save our ship ,” “ save our souls ,” or any other phrase . as an account of the time noted , “ the combination of letters have no especial significance except that they are easy to sound and click out strong and easily read .” ( in any case , an international conference held in berlin and featuring <PARA> representatives of several different european nations was unlikely to have opted for a distress call that abbreviated a phrase significant only to english - speaking <PARA> mariners .) <PARA> great britain and several other nations had voted to adopt the berlin conference ’ s proposals by 1908 , but wireless operators on british ships largely ignored them . thus when the titanic struck an iceberg and started to sink in april 1912 , jack phillips began transmitting the older cqd distress signal to other ships in the area . according to harold bride , the titanic ‘ s junior wireless operator , it was not until he jokingly suggested “ send sos ; it ’ s the new call , and this may <PARA> be your last chance to send it !” that phillips began to intersperse sos with the traditional cqd call . although sos may have been a “ new call ” to british wireless <PARA> operators in 1912 because they had not previously been using it , sos was far from “ new ” in an overall sense — it had been proposed , adopted , and used by other ships years before the titanic sank . <PARA> an article published in the new york times in february 1910 , more than two years prior to the titanic disaster , detailed the origins and uses of sos as a distress call , and in the pages of that newspaper one can find several examples of ships ’ employing the sos call that antedate the 14 april 1912 sinking of the titanic : <PARA> the first news that the vessel had met with an accident came to the united wireless station at hatteras when p . b . haubner , the wireless operator on board , began sending out “ s . o . s .,” the united wireless company ’ s signal of distress . the shore station soon got into communication with the disabled vessel , and in response came a message stating that the arapahoe had broken her tail shaft . <PARA> the united wireless company explained last night that “ s . o . s .” was really the signal for help , and that it was the one adopted by the international wireless congress held in berlin in 1906 . the company disowned the now famous sea call “ c . q . d .” <PARA> the united wireless company explained last night that “ s . o . s .” was

coming of the alamo to the rescue was in response to the wireless signal of distress “ s . o . s .” which is used on these ships instead of “ c . q . d .” this signal was flashed in all directions this morning by w . d . maginnis , the operator on the kentuckym and was received by e . d . seaman , the alamo ’ s operator , about 11 : 30 a . m . it was followed by this brief message : <PARA> “ we are sinking . our latitude is 32 degrees 10 minutes ; longitude 76 degrees 30 minutes . kentucky .” <PARA> seaman ran with the message to the alamo ’ s skipper , and a moment later the bells in the engine room were ringing the signals that changed the alamo ’ s course and turned her nose in the direction of the sinking kentucky . <PARA> “ we are sinking . our latitude is 32 degrees 10 minutes ;

false	examples : [ collected via twitter , december 2014 ] <PARA> origins : shortly after beth greene , a character played by emily kinney on the hit amc show the walking dead was killed during the mid - season season 5 finale of that program , fans started a petition in order to convince the network to bring the character back to life : <PARA> more than 50 , 000 people signed the petition , and thousands more took to twitter to beg amc to bring beth greene back to life . on 12 december 2014 the national report , a satire and entertainment web site , took advantage of the frenzy and published an article claiming executive producer robert kirkman had agreed to his fans ’ demands : <PARA> while it is difficult to receive comment from kirkman himself , sources say he ’ s openly admitted he ’ s “ working on it ” when asked about bringing beth back to life on the show . it seems that the walking dead fans are winning the beth greene battle . <PARA> while the national report does not clearly identify itself as an entertainment ( i . e ., fake news ) publication , the site used to carry a disclaimer that stated “ all news articles contained within national report are fiction , and presumably fake news .” <PARA> the hidden disclaimer , coupled with the fact that fans of the walking dead were desperately trying to get beth greene to come back to the amc show , provided the national report with fodder to create a viral fake news story .

false	in march 2015 , the “ rhodes must fall ” campaign began at the university of cape town in south africa , when students began pushing for the campus to take down a statue of cecil rhodes . <PARA> rhodes ( the former prime minister of cape colony ) was a businessman and politician . he was also an ardent imperialist who was part of the effort to annex large parts of land in south africa in the late 1800s , making enormous sums of money and eventually founding the de beers diamond firm . <PARA> many universities in south africa bear his name , and for years , rhodes has been lauded for his accomplishments . however , he also passed laws which laid the groundwork for apartheid in the country , and is thus also regarded as a symbol of repression , colonization , and apartheid — which has no place , activists say , on a university campus , especially in a region of the world that still struggles with the aftereffects of institutional racism . <PARA> the “ rhodes must fall ” campaign was successful at the university of south africa ; the school removed the statue in april 2015 , a month after the protest there began . students and anti - colonialism activists then began similar protests to remove statues at other universities , including oxford , where rhodes ( who was born in england ) remains a large figure . oxford university still offers the elite rhodes scholarship , and a statue in his likeness presides over the university ’ s oriel college campus . <PARA> in january 2016 , oxford students voted to remove the statue . later that month , the university opted to keep the statue after receiving threats from alumni to withdraw millions in donations if it was removed . the college ’ s decision sparked more marches and ongoing protests , keeping the issue in the news . <PARA> a letter about the cecil rhodes statue at oxford university began to be widely circulated via social media and e - mail after it was originally published on the web site breitbart in december 2015 . the message ( a missive that in part laments today ’ s politically correct culture ) is often preceded by the claim that it is an official letter from oxford university ’ s chancellor , chris patten . the original posting on breitbart starts with a small disclaimer informing the reader that the following message is what oxford should have told its students , and not what the university actually said : <PARA> the above - displayed message was eventually stripped from the letter and replaced with the claim that it was an official piece of correspondence from patten to the student ’ s of oxford : <PARA> while patten did argue against the removal of the rhodes statue during an appearance on the today program on bbc radio 4 in january 2016 , his language was far tamer than the openly racist rhetoric employed in breitbart ’ s fictional letter : <PARA> the protests , which have developed into an international movement , are real and ongoing . however , the circulating letter that ’ s alleged to be from oxford university ’ s chancellor is fake , and first originated as a satirical op - ed piece written by a london - based contributor to breitbart . com .
mixture	this item about the meanings of the folds in a flag reminds me of a joke told by deadpan comedian steven wright : “ why is the alphabet in that order ? is it because of that song ?” as often happens , a “ meaning ” has been grafted onto some facet of everyday life , to the point that a symbolic and after - the - fact meaning has been confused with an original purpose . <PARA> traditional flag etiquette prescribes that before an american flag is stored or presented , its handlers should twice fold it in half lengthwise ; then ( from the end opposite the blue field ) make a triangular fold , continuing to fold it in triangles until the other end is reached . this makes a triangular “ pillow ” of the flag with only the blue starred field showing on the outside , and it takes thirteen folds to produce : two lengthwise folds and eleven triangular ones . <PARA> the american flag isn ’ t folded in this manner because each of the folds has a special symbolic meaning ; the flag is folded this way because it provides a dignified ceremonial touch that distinguishes folding a flag from folding an ordinary object such as a bedsheet , and because it results a visually pleasing , easy - to - handle shape . this thirteen - fold procedure was a common practice long before the creation of a ceremonial assignation of “ meaning ” to each of the steps . <PARA> an elaborate flag folding ceremony incorporating these meanings has since been devised for special occasions such as memorial day and veterans day . these associations are “ real ” in the sense that they mean something to the people who participate in the ceremony , but they are not the reason why a flag is folded in the traditional thirteen - step manner . as was the case with the candy cane , an invented ( religious ) symbolism has become so widespread that it is now often mistakenly assumed to have been an integral part of the origins of the item it is associated with . <PARA> it is also a common misbelief that the above - quoted script originated with the u . s . air force ( usaf ) and is used by default at all veterans ’ funerals conducted under the aegis of the u . s . military . this is not the case , as the usaf has noted :

unproven	commonly known as “ aids mary ” or “ aids harry ,” this legend came into prominence in late 1986 and was as much an expression of the fears of that time as anything else . though aids had been with us for years before that , it was only in the late 1980s that heterosexuals began to wake up to this grim reaper walking among them , not just their gay siblings : <PARA> ( a related legend has it that madmen attack the unsuspecting with aids - tainted needles . see our pin prick attacks page for more on this related myth .) <PARA> when the “ aids mary ” legend began spreading , aids was a fearsome disease : once hiv - positive , the infected lived under a death sentence . that alone would frighten anyone , but tie this deadly disease to the usual apprehensions about sex with anyone ( let alone strangers ), and a cautionary urban legend results . <PARA> the legend speaks to our fears ; as such , it ’ s larger than life , complete with shocking messages of impending death callously delivered . in the “ aids mary ” version ( woman infects man ), a fellow picks up a young lady for a one - night sexual encounter . everything goes swimmingly , and he ’ s quite pleased about the whole thing , until the next morning when he awakens to find her gone and the words “ welcome to the world of aids ” scrawled in lipstick on his bathroom mirror . <PARA> the “ aids harry ” version ( man infects woman ) usually features a romance of some duration taking place in a faraway place . the depraved infector passes along his good news by way of a gift , which he asks his victim to unwrap once she ’ s on the plane home . depending upon where you hear this story , the gift will be a minature coffin ( ceramic or wooden ) or a coffee mug . whichever item it is , it will invariably be emblazoned with the message “ welcome to the world of aids .” <PARA> often given as the reason for the infector ’ s rampage through the ranks of the previously untouched is the justification of his or her having caught the disease from a member of the opposite sex — now the entire gender will be made to pay . this cautionary tale warns against the dangers of promiscuity , but it also brings into play the fear of falling prey to a random act of violence at the hands of a madman . <PARA> there have been actual cases of the hiv - infected engaging in unprotected sex without first informing their partners of their condition . in the largest documented case of its kind , darnell “ boss man ” mcgee infected at least 18 women and girls . mcgee , 28 , had more than 100 known sex partners before he was slain in 1997 in an apparent robbery attempt . in 1998 , authorities in new york said 17 people are believed to have hiv infections linked to nushawn williams . such tragedies are real , but the stuff of legends , the deliberate infection of another as a way of exacting revenge on an entire sex has proved elusive to pin down . <PARA> even so , there might be one real aids mary to record on the pages of this legend ’ s history . <PARA> in july 1998 hiv - positive pamela wiser of lewisburg , tennessee , was picked up by police on a tip from a man she ’ d slept with . under questioning , she claimed over the previous year to have had sex with more than 50 men in an effort to take revenge for three years earlier having caught the disease from her then boyfriend . she claimed to have informed each of the men of her condition prior to engaging them in sexual activity . <PARA> within a few days of her arrest , her story began to change . she revised the number of men exposed down from fifty to five . by the time her case came to trial in december , 1998 , she had settled on 22 but then was asserting her motivation for sleeping with them stemmed from an inability to say no , not from any desire to cause harm . <PARA> some of wiser ’ s former lovers testified she hadn ’ t informed them she was hiv - positive and that , moreover , she outright denied the need for protection when directly asked . one of them has since tested positive for the disease . <PARA> in february , 1999 , wiser was sentenced to 26 - 1 / 2 years in prison . <PARA> was the motivation revenge , an inability to say no , or something altogether different ? without cracking open her head and looking in , it ’ s impossible to tell . whichever way one calls the wiser episode , it should be noted no lipsticked mirrors or teeny ceramic coffins played any part in the story . <PARA> the key difference between legend and real life goes to motivation . the real - life bad guys who don ’ t give their partners a choice by informing them of the risks ahead of time are driven by denial ( i ’ m not really sick ; i ’ m not going to die ), indifference ( nobody looked out for me ), or fear of loss of affection ( she won ’ t want me once she finds out about this ), whereas the storybook ones are out to exact revenge for the wrong done them . it ’ s the difference between a fiendish rifle - wielding madman cold - bloodedly picking off random freeway drivers , and a self - pitying fool carelessly weaving in and out of traffic , oblivious to the carnage he ’ s causing around him — one is murdering with malice aforethought , and the other is indifferent to harm he might or might not be causing . <PARA> speaking to the second variety , the 1992 the case of roy cornes captured worldwide attention . dubbed the “ aids timebomb ,” he was accused of knowingly infecting at least four women ( one of whom has since died , as has he ). he maintained harming others was not his intent , his partners knew of his condition ( a claim some of them disputed ), and that in a couple of early cases he passed along the virus because he didn ’ t yet understand what precautions to take , while in a later case , he and his fiancee were trying for a baby and she took the risks willingly . <PARA> we ’ re tempted to dismiss his claims of how all this infecting came about , but then we ’ re left scrambling for a reasonable explanation for his actions . revenge on all women for one particular woman having given him the virus couldn ’ t have been his motive , because he contracted hiv from blood tranfusions . ( he was a hemophiliac ). depraved indifference , then ? <PARA> hardest of all to classify are the motivations of gaetan dugas , aids “ patient zero .” in 1980 this charming and handsome canadian airline attendant was diagnosed with kaposi ’ s sarcoma ( a type of skin cancer ). until his death in 1984 , he continued to engage in episodes of unprotected sex with a variety of partners . these were the early days of aids ( which incidentally didn ’ t get its name until 1982 ), and what was going on , let alone how it was being transmitted , wasn ’ t at all clear . back then there was no strong central authority braying out messages that unprotected sex could kill or even that aids was communicated through sexual contact . in the absence of that , those with a mind to could well ignore what was slowly surfacing in the press or dismiss it as so much hooey . <PARA> dugas appeared to move between denial that whatever he had could be transmitted sexually (“ of course i ’ m going to have sex . nobody ’ s proven to me that you can spread cancer ”), depraved indifference to his partners ’ wellbeing (“ it ’ s their duty to protect themselves . they know what ’ s going on out there . they ’ ve heard about this disease ”), and a desire to take others with him (“ i ’ ve got gay cancer . i ’ m going to die and so are you ”). possibly his rationale came down to something much simpler — he loved sex , if not his partners . living under a death sentence , perhaps he was determined to enjoy his last moments on earth , and consequences be damned . <PARA> the spectre of the vengeful aids carrier looms far larger than the real cases of those whose indifference led them to infect others . in 1995 an irish priest shocked his congregation with the tale of an hiv - positive woman who had slept with up to 80 young men across four southern irish counties in a deliberate attempt to infect as many as possible with the deadly aids virus . the priest said he had personally traced about 25 of the men , and that five had tested positive for hiv . scary stuff indeed , and who would doubt the word of a priest ? <PARA> months went by , and although parishioners continued to take the roman - collared vector ’ s word as gospel , health officials could find nothing to substantiate the priest ’ s claims . indeed , speaking to his credibility , a follow - up article about this man made mention of another improbable tale he was now spreading : <PARA> in other words , this is one yarn spinner of a holy man . <PARA> at least one criminal tried to use the gist of the ‘ aids mary ’ legend as part of his legal defense . in his trial for the 1990 murder of linda hoberg , jeffrey hengehold claimed he ’ d met the victim in a bar and had sex with her later that night ; as they were parting , she said , “ welcome to the world of aids .” he then proceeded to beat her to death . <PARA> though hengehold claimed this was his motive for the murder , there was no evidence to prove it one way or the other . hengehold had cremated hoberg ’ s body , making it impossible to determine if she ’ d had aids , and he himself never tested positive for hiv . <PARA> the laws of most countries are inadequate when it comes to assessing and penalizing the crime of knowingly transmitting a deadly disease , but at least one of them is moving in the right direction . britain is even now trying to reform laws to cover this form of assault . changes are in the works that would result in an hiv - infected person who tried to pass on the virus out of malice being charged with grievous bodily harm with intent , and those who simply failed to take proper precautions charged under the lesser offence of causing grievous bodily harm . <PARA> sightings : scary legends also make great movie plots , so it should come as no surprise this legend showed up as the plot of the 1992 german movie via appia . ( an airline steward has a one - night fling . he wakes the next morning to find his partner gone and “ welcome to the aids club ” written in soap on his mirror .) the plot of an hiv - positive man deliberately trying to infect as many women as possible was also used for an episode of tv ’ s law & order (“ carrier ”, originally broadcast 1 april 1998 ).
false	in may 1919 at dusseldorf , germany , the allied forces discovered a copy of these ‘ rules .’ they were first printed in the united states in the ‘ bartlesville ( oklahoma ) examiner - enterprise ’ the same year , 1919 . <PARA> almost 20 years later , in 1946 , the attorney general of florida obtained them from a known member of the communist party , who acknowledged that the ‘ rules ’ were then still a part of the communist program for the united states . <PARA> 1 . corrupt the young , get them away from religion . get them interested in sex . make them superficial . destroy their ruggedness . <PARA> 2 . get control of all means of publicity . <PARA> 3 . get people ’ s minds off their government by focusing their attention on athletics , sexy books and other trivialities . <PARA> 4 . divide the people into hostile groups by constantly harping on controversial matters of no importance . <PARA> 5 . destroy the people ’ s faith in their natural leaders by holding the latter up to contempt , ridicule and obloquy . <PARA> 6 . always preach true democracy , but seize power as fast and as ruthlessly as possible . <PARA> 7 . by encouraging government extravagance , destroy its credit and produce fear of inflation with rising prices and general discontent . <PARA> 8 . foment unnecessary strikes in vital industries , encourage civil disorders , and foster a lenient and soft attitude on the part of government toward such disorders . <PARA> 9 . by specious argument cause the breakdown of the old moral virtues , honesty , sobriety , continence , faith in the pledged word , ruggedness . <PARA> 10 . cause the registration of all firearms on some pretext , with a view to confiscating them and leaving the populace helpless . <PARA> now , stop and think — how many of these rules are being carried out in this nation today ? i don ’ t see how any thinking person can truthfully say that the communists do not have any part in the chaos that is upsetting our nation . or is it just one big coincidence ? i doubt it . <PARA> origins : a time - honored ploy in the political arena has been to discredit your opponents ( and their ideas ) by demonizing them , through associating them with ... well , demons . in the modern era , this has usually meant claiming the ideas your opponents advocate were implemented by nazis or communists , or were recognized by them as means of “ softening up ” a country and making it ripe for totalitarian takeover . so , for example , if you believe the film industry should be more heavily regulated to prevent it from corrupting our youth , simply reference a supposed historical document in which communists proclaim they were able to seize power in russia because the previous government had allowed callow youth to idle away their time watching “ immoral movies ,” and your point is irrefutably made . <PARA> as reproduced in the example above , one purportedly genuine document of such ilk is a list of “ communist rules for revolution ” which is typically claimed to have been discovered “ in may 1919 at dusseldorf , germany , by allied forces ” and “ first printed in the united states ” in the bartlesville , oklahoma examiner - enterprise . aside from the fact that the examiner - enterprise is a real newspaper , none of this rings true . language about getting the young “ interested in sex ” and focusing their attention on “ sexy books ” and <PARA> fretting about the “ registration of all firearms ” sounds out of place for 1919 ( as this ngram chart shows , “ sexy ” is a word one was far more likely to have encountered in america during the post - world war ii era than in 1919 ), and not surprisingly , nobody has ever managed to turn up the mysterious issue of examiner - enterprise that supposedly printed this list . when columnist bob greene checked out this piece with russian specialists at the university of chicago and northwestern university in the mid - 1980s , they said the list was “ a total fraud ,” “ an obvious fabrication ,” and “ an implausible concoction of american fears and phobias .” ( greene also wrote : “ i always wanted to meet a communist who was carrying the list around , so i could ask him what ‘ obloquy ’ means .”) <PARA> when the new york times ran an article on this piece back in 1970 , it had already been circulating for about twenty - five years . the times reported that neither the national archives , the library of congress , nor university libraries had a copy of any such document . when montana senator lee metcalf looked into the issue back then , he checked with the fbi , cia , and the senate internal security subcommittee ; he found that “ exhaustive research ” had proved the rules to be “ completely spurious ,” and he declared that “ the extreme right also follows rules , one of which is to make maximum use of false , misleading and fear - inspiring quotations .” nonetheless , numerous members of congress have received copies of the communist “ rules ” list from alarmed constituents over the years and , believing that nobody else was yet aware of them , have inserted them into the congressional record . this list has also been reproduced in many newspaper columns and letters to the editor . <PARA> the earliest known publication of these rules dates from february 1946 , and it ’ s significant to note that publication coincided with events such as winston churchill ’ s famous “ iron curtain ” speech , in which he issued a warning to citizens of the united states that “ communist parties constitute a growing challenge and peril to christian civilization .” the timing suggests it ’ s far more likely this list was compiled by americans in 1946 than by russians in 1919 . <PARA> circulation of this list really took off during the height of the cold war in 1954 ( the same year that a military defeat by viet minh communists forced the french out of indochina , and senator joseph mccarthy charged that communists had infiltrated the cia and the atomic weapons industry ) after florida state attorney george a . brautigam endorsed the document as genuine . ( for many years afterward , printed versions of the list included his statement of its authenticity and reproduced his signature at the bottom .) even though the soviet union has long since ceased to be , and the number of communist countries remaining in the world can be counted on the fingers of one hand , the “ communist rules for revolution ” are still anachronistically cited as evidence that america is experiencing moral and political decay fostered by outside forces . as folklorist jan harold brunvand wrote of this piece back in 1986 : <PARA> the rules have to do with dividing people into hostile groups , encouraging government extravagance , and fomenting “ unnecessary ” strikes in vital industries . what we have lost , the list suggests , is a world without dissent , budget deficits , inflation and labor unrest . <PARA> i just can ’ t remember any such golden age . <PARA> i just can ’ t remember any such golden age .

false	three weeks ago , i published a brief snippet on the front page of my web site reporting the governments of the us canada and mexico are conspiring in secret to merge the three nations into a new entity called the north american union . <PARA> there has been much talk of this on various internet blogs for over a year . most of those blogs have been smeared as “ conspiracy theorists ” and have been largely ignored by the main stream . <PARA> what prompted my interest in the issue was money : i was sent professional images of actual amero coins by someone in the us treasury ! the person included a note saying they like my radio show and are frightened by what ’ s been going on in secret within our government . <PARA> this treasury department person was outraged that our country was beginning to coin money as part of a merger that would do away with our country , via a merger the american public knew nothing about ! <PARA> ( rest of article here ). <PARA> origins : to make sense of this wild tale about “ amero ” coins being secretly minted by the u . s . government for use by an economic union of the usa , canada , and mexico , we will first delve into what the euro is and why some folks are far from enamored of it . bear with us while we take that short side <PARA> trip . ( or , if you must , skip the next three paragraphs to transition directly to the u . s . portion of the story .) <PARA> the euro is the official currency of the european union , a supranational union comprising 27 member states , and is the sole currency for more than 317 million people . ( not every eu member country has chosen to adopt the euro ; some continue to use their traditional currencies .) <PARA> the move to a single currency in europe comes with both advantages and disadvantages . on the plus side , it does away with the cost of exchanging money , thereby leaving more cash in the pockets of both individual consumers and businesses . it also puts an end to the trouble of having to change one ’ s currency into that of the country being traveled to or traded with , then having to change it back again afterwards — one simply uses the same wad of bills . and it ends fluctuations in the value of one country ’ s money in relation to that of another : when only one currency is used , a cross - border deal struck for a specified amount of cash does not suddenly go up or down in price as the financial markets move , thereby ruining one party to the deal while dropping a windfall into the undeserving lap of the other . <PARA> on the downside , one central currency means one central bank , which means one central monetary policy . that means individual countries which have subscribed to such a plan cannot combat their individual homelands ’ economic problems by adjusting their countries ’ money supplies , either to stimulate growth in moribund national economies or to put the brakes on those that appear to be racing out of control — those countries must instead abide by what the group is doing , even when it runs counter to their individual best interests . <PARA> that covers what ’ s going on in europe , and why some love the euro while others view it as a dangerous idea set loose upon an unsuspecting public . at various times it has been suggested that north america should follow a like route by adopting an omnibus currency similar to the euro , one that would serve as the common money for the usa , canada , and mexico . while that notion does have a few proponents , it is a long way from being taken seriously , let alone being regarded as a good idea . <PARA> which brings us to the question of the “ amero ,” the name bestowed upon the hypothetical currency such a union would use as its common specie . in 1999 , a professor of economics at simon fraser university in vancouver published the case for the amero , a study that advanced the idea that the <PARA> three north american countries would be better served by their having a common currency . and there the matter rests , or at least it did before designs computed thought to add to its catalogue of commemorative coins , medals , and tokens a suite of ameros , a series of collectible coins struck from its concept of what coinage for such a currency might look like . designs computed is very clear on its web site that its ameros are in fact “ private - issue fantasy pattern coins [ that ] will be struck as an annual series ,” and indeed is already offering some of them for sale . neither the u . s . mint nor the u . s . treasury had a hand in creating these “ ameros .” these coins are merely collectibles offered to the buying public by a private company in the business of manufacturing such curiosities . <PARA> on 31 august 2007 , radio host hal turner used images of the amero tokens offered by designs computed as the basis for propagating a patently false tale about his having been given a “ real ” amero coin on the sly by an anonymous treasury agent , and that the existence of said coin was “ proof ” that the usa , canada , and mexico were “ to be merged into a single new entity ” known as the north american union . <PARA> after we ( and others ) debunked turner ’ s fictional , outrage - provoking conspiracy theory by pointing out the true origin of the amero tokens , he began claiming that the designs computed site had been hastily erected on the internet as part of “ a full blown effort to discredit my story and the images as fake .” that was not the case : daniel carr , the entrepreneur behind designs computed , has been displaying the coins he has designed on his web site since at least 2000 and has been offering some of them for sale since at least 2005 . while his “ amero ” entry dates only to 2007 , the coins depicted thereon fit seamlessly into his catalogue of similar offerings , including his “ parody state quarters .” <PARA> ( do have a look at some of his “ parody state quarters ,” particularly maine ‘ s and colorado ‘ s , which especially tickled our fancy .) <PARA> barbara “ maine event ” mikkelson

false	on 3 september 2017 , the web site freedom daily rehashed an old ( and largely untrue ) rumor holding that a police union in florida had announced that they would not protect miami dolphins players in retaliation for players kneeling during the national anthem : <PARA> in the example above , the article begins by claiming that the “ florida sheriffs office ” will not “ put up with this crap ,” and then ta <PARA> this article is based on a grain of truth — a local police union urged officers and the broward county sheriff ’ s office in september 2016 not to participate in miami dolphins events — but it is outdated and contains several factual errors . <PARA> in response to the growing number of nfl players who started to kneel during the national anthem in protest of racial and social injustices , jeffery bell , the president of the broward sheriff ’ s office deputies association , local 6020 , ( which is affiliated with the international union of police associations ) posted a message to the union ’ s facebook page on 15 september 2016 urging officers not to work any detail associated with the miami dolphins : <PARA> the freedom daily writers failed to grasp two important concepts : a police union is not the same as a sheriff ’ s office , and a request is not the same as a policy . these mistakes were even more obvious when the freedom daily first reported on this facebook post in september 2016 in a story published under the factually inaccurate title “ florida sheriff ’ s office will not escort miami dolphins until they stand for national anthem .” <PARA> the “ florida sheriff ’ s office ,” of course , made no such statement . for one thing , there is no “ florida sheriff ’ s office ” — sheriffs provide law enforcement at the county level . broward county sheriff scott israel said at the time that his officers would continue to provide security for the dolphins , despite the union ’ s request : <PARA> the washington post also noted that the broward county officers who worked security for the miami dolphins did so in an off - duty capacity . while an individual officer could have chosen to turn down the detail , that would hardly constitute a department - wide boycott . furthermore , a spokeswoman for the broward county sheriff ’ s office said at the time that she didn ’ t expect any sort of widespread protest : <PARA> other police forces , such as the miami - dade police , have a contract to provide security at a venue . a spokesperson for the miami - dade police , who also provide game day security for the miami dolphins , told the miami herald : <PARA> in addition to misrepresenting the police union ’ s statement , failing to report the police department ’ s response , and spreading a false rumor concerning the miami dolphins ’ relationship with police officers , freedom daily also shared this article with a misleading photograph . the article ’ s featured image does not show a broward county official making this alleged announcement . this photograph actually shows pasco county sheriff chris nocco speaking to the media after a retired officer shot and killed a man at a movie theater in january 2014 .
false	sex is a subject which , because it has long been considered an inappropriate topic for public discourse in our society , is a particularly favorite topic of non - public discourse . we gossip about people who are having sex , we gossip about people who aren ’ t having sex , and we gossip about people who are having too much sex . we titter about people who know too much about sex , and we chortle at people who know too little about sex . <PARA> the latter point is well - represented in urban folklore , which abounds with tales of sexually naive adults who don ’ t understand what sex is , have sex the “ wrong ” way , or don ’ t grasp the rudiments of birth control : <PARA> thus we have tales of childless couples who discover their infertility is due to either a complete lack of intercourse or to the husband ’ s mistakenly penetrating his wife ’ s urethra ( because no one ever explained sex or proper sexual techniques to them ), couples who use prophylactics by placing them on the ends of bananas or broomsticks ( because that ’ s how condom use was demonstrated to them ), and women aghast at finding themselves pregnant even though they ’ ve been consuming contraceptive jelly . <PARA> ( in joseph heller ’ s novel catch - 22 , doc daneeka reminisces to yossarian about his days in private practice , and he talks about a couple who once came to him because they were unable to conceive a child . despite the couple ’ s claims of regular sex , the doctor discovered upon examination that the wife was still a virgin . he used plastic models to demonstrate to the couple how to have sex the “ correct ” way , and a few days later the husband returned and punched him in the face .) <PARA> in may 2004 , yet another news article reported the classic “ couple discovers they ’ re childless because they ’ re not having sex ” tale , this one supposedly involving a couple who sought to undergo an ivf ( in vitro fertilisation ) procedure at the lübeck university hospital fertility clinic in germany , where the staff determined the cause of the couple ’ s childless state was their having “ never made love ”— the couple thought all they had to do in order to conceive was “ to lie next to each other and let nature take its course .” ( their ignorance of sex was attributed to their having been brought up in a “ strict religious environment .”) <PARA> although doctors at the lübeck fertility clinic did treat a couple whose inability to conceive was a result of their never having engaged in intercourse , nothing else about the story as reported was accurate : the couple had not been raised in a “ strict religious environment ,” they were not “ woefully ignorant ” of sexual matters , they were not unaware of the necessary connection between sexual intercourse and conception , and they did not think the ivf process involved a “ turkey baster , a mattress and a woman standing on her head .” what had happened was that in 2003 the german medical journal gynäkologische endokrinologie had published an article about the importance of sexual history in the diagnosis of infertility , and someone took one of the case studies presented in that article and rewrote it in farcical form . the uk newspapers the mirror and the sun and other media outlets ( such as upi ) picked up the farcical version and published it as straight news in may 2004 , and the story was quickly spread throughout the internet as a real - life example of the “ too dumb to know about sex ” legend . <PARA> what the original medical journal article actually documented was a case in which a 30 - year - old woman and her 36 - year - old husband presented themselves at the lübeck infertility clinic and reported they had experienced difficulty conceiving a child . the couple had been together for eight years and had been married for three , but although they had wanted a child for the last four years , results were not forthcoming . <PARA> doctors at the clinic proceeded to give the couple a routine workup but discovered no immediately apparent medical indicator of infertility . when someone at the clinic noticed that the couple had written a question mark next to a questionnaire item asking about their frequency of sexual intercourse , doctors began making inquiries of the couple regarding their sexual history . what doctors learned from their questioning was that the couple had never engaged in sexual intercourse — not because they were ignorant of sexual matters , but because the husband had suffered from erectile dysfunction throughout the length of their relationship . <PARA> although the husband was reluctant to speak of the matter , the wife explained that she knew of no physical reason why her husband was unable to engage in sex with her ; she had assumed the problem was a psychological one and had hoped that it would go away once they married , but it had not . doctors performed a physical examination of the husband and found no abnormality other than a frenulum breve , which they treated with a minor surgical procedure . the husband was able to produce a semen sample through masturbation , and tests found the quantity and motility of the sperm in that sample to be within the normal range . doctors advised the couple that ivf was not a recommended course of action until their relationship and sexual issues had first been addressed and urged them to seek counseling . <PARA> sightings : <PARA> on 24 august 2018 , a version of the long - circulating story was reported as news by the uk outlet metro . that iteration was virtually identical to the legend , and light on credible detail about how the couple ’ s purported ignorance came to light :

unproven	the founding fathers placed no limits in the u . s . constitution regarding how many times any one person could be elected ( or otherwise serve ) as president of the united states . however , in 1947 ( after franklin d . roosevelt had broken with tradition and the democrats won five consecutive presidential elections ), congress passed the 22nd amendment , ratified by the requisite number of states in 1951 , which created a two - term limit for future presidents . that amendment ( along with earlier constitutional restrictions ) would seem to disqualify barack obama from ever again attaining the office of president or vice president of the united states , as he was elected to , and served , two full terms in that office between 2009 and 2017 . <PARA> however , the wording of the 22nd amendment doesn ’ t literally say that no one can be president for more than two terms ; only that no one can be elected president more than twice : <PARA> presumably this still leaves open the loophole ( intended or not ) that one who had already been elected twice could still serve as president again by attaining that office through other means — particularly , by being elected or appointed vice - president and thus becoming next in the line of presidential succession when the sitting president dies , becomes incapacitated , or resigns : <PARA> but does that loophole really exist ? some maintain it doesn ’ t because the 12th amendment ( ratified in 1804 to fix some unexpected issues with the originally specified methods for selecting the president and vice - president ) states that “ no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of president shall be eligible to that of vice - president of the united states .” so , one who has already twice been elected president isn ’ t eligible to become vice - president afterwards and thereby potentially sneak into the presidency again through the back door . <PARA> again we bump into some problems of literalness , though , because some would argue that a person who has already run up against the limits of the 22nd amendment isn ’ t “ constitutionally ineligible ” to be president ( i . e ., that person doesn ’ t fail to meet one or more of the requirements specified in article ii of the constitution , such as being at least 35 years old or a natural - born citizen of the united states ) but is merely constitutionally ineligible to be elected president . under this interpretation , a former two - term president would still be eligible , under the law , to obtain and hold the office of vice president through election or appointment to that position . <PARA> ultimately , the only answer to this hypothetical is that there is no answer : this is an interpretive legal issue that , should it ever arise , would have to be decided by the judicial branch of the u . s . government .

false	the notion that the pentagon was not damaged by terrorists who hijacked american airlines flight 77 ( a boeing 757 ) and crashed it into the military office complex , but that the whole affair was staged by the u . s . government , has been promulgated by french author thierry meyssan in his book , the frightening fraud . meyssan offers no real explanation for what did cause the extensive damage to the pentagon , asserting only that flight 77 did not exist , no plane crashed into the pentagon , and that “ the american government is lying .” <PARA> unfortunately , the appeal of conspiracy theories has resulted in widespread dissemination of meyssan ’ s “ theory ” in france and the usa , particularly in web sites that mirrored his work . as le nouvel observateur noted : “ this theory suits everyone — there are no islamic extremists and everyone is happy . it eliminates reality .” <PARA> the points cited below come from the hunt the boeing ! and test your perceptions ! web site , one of the english - language mirrors of meyssan ’ s claims , where readers were invited to ponder a series of questions about why photographs of the damaged pentagon seemingly show no evidence of a crashed airplane . the answers to the questions posed there are as follows : <PARA> 1 ) can you explain how a boeing 757 - 200 , weighing nearly 100 tons and traveling at a minimum speed of 250 miles an hour only damaged the outside of the pentagon ? <PARA> for starters , modern airliners are essentially large hollow tubes , not solid masses of metal . and despite the appearances of exterior photographs , the boeing 757 - 200 did not “ only damage the outside of the pentagon .” it caused damage to all five rings ( not just the outermost one ) after penetrating a reinforced , 24 - inch - thick outer wall . as 60 minutes ii reported in its “ miracle of the pentagon ” episode on 28 november 2001 , the section of the pentagon into which the hijacked airliner was flown had just been reinforced during a renovation project : <PARA> exterior photographs are misleading because they show only the intact roof structures of the outer rings and don ’ t reveal that the plane penetrated all the way to the ground floor of the third ring . as a u . s . army press release noted back on 26 september 2001 , one engine of the aircraft punched a 12 - foot hole through the wall of the second ring : <PARA> recall that when the first airliner was flown into a world trade center tower on september 11 — before it was known that the “ accident ” was really part of a deliberate terrorist attack — newscasters were speculating that a small plane had accidentally flown into the side of the tower , because the visible exterior damage didn ’ t seem as extensive as what people thought a large airliner would cause . even though the two airplanes flown into the world trade center towers were traveling faster at the time of impact than the pentagon plane was ( 400 mph vs . 350 mph ), hit aluminum - and - glass buildings rather than reinforced concrete walls , and didn ’ t dissipate much of their energy striking the ground first ( as the pentagon plane did ), they still barely penetrated all the way through the wtc towers . <PARA> below is a march 2002 photograph of the the rebuilding effort underway at the pentagon , demonstrating that far more than just the “ outside ” of the building was damaged and needed to be repaired : <PARA> 2 ) can you explain how a boeing 14 . 9 yards high , 51 . 7 yards long , with a wingspan of 41 . 6 yards and a cockpit 3 . 8 yards high , could crash into just the ground floor of this building ? <PARA> as eyewitnesses described and photographs demonstrate , the hijacked airliner dived so low as it approached the pentagon that it actually hit the ground first , thereby dissipating much of the energy that might otherwise have caused more extensive damage to the building ; nonetheless , as described by the new york times , the plane still hit not “ just the ground floor ” but between the first and second floors : <PARA> another account of the crash stated : <PARA> 3 ) you ’ ll remember that the aircraft only hit the ground floor of the pentagon ’ s first ring . can you find debris of a boeing 757 - 200 in this photograph ? <PARA> you ’ ll recall from the discussions above that the hijacked airliner did not “ only hit the ground floor of the pentagon ’ s first ring ” — it struck the pentagon between the first and second floors and blasted all the way through to the third ring . because the plane disappeared into the building ’ s interior after penetrating the outer ring , it was not visible in photographs taken from outside the pentagon . moreover , since the airliner was full of jet fuel and was flown into thick , reinforced concrete walls at high speed , exploding in a fireball , any pieces of wreckage large enough to be identifiable in after - the - fact photographs taken from a few hundred feet away burned up in the intense fire that followed the crash ( just as the planes flown into the world trade center towers burned up , and the intensity of their jet - fuel fires caused both towers to collapse ). <PARA> small pieces of airplane debris were plainly visible on the pentagon lawn in other photographs , however , such as the one below : <PARA> 4 ) can you explain why the defence secretary deemed it necessary to sand over the lawn , which was otherwise undamaged after the attack ? <PARA> the claim that the “ defence secretary ” ordered the lawn to be sanded over is false . a base of sand and gravel was laid on the pentagon lawn by workers because the trucks and other heavy equipment used to haul away the debris ( as shown in the photograph below ) would have been slipping and sliding on the grass and become mired in the pentagon lawn otherwise . <PARA> 5 ) can you explain what happened to the wings of the aircraft and why they caused no damage ? <PARA> as the front of the boeing 757 hit the pentagon , the outer portions of the wings likely snapped during the initial impact , then were pushed inward towards the fuselage and carried into the building ’ s interior ; the inner portions of the wings probably penetrated the pentagon walls with the rest of the plane . any sizable portions of the wings were destroyed in the explosion or the subsequent fire . nonetheless , damage to the building caused by the plane ’ s wings is plainly visible in photographs , such as the one below ( note the blackened sections on both sides of the impact site ): <PARA> 6 ) can you explain why the county fire chief could not tell reporters where the aircraft was ? <PARA> the exact quote offered here was : <PARA> the fire chief wasn ’ t asked “ where the aircraft was ”; he was asked “ is there anything left of the aircraft at all ?” he did indeed provide an answer to the question he was asked : there were no large sections of the plane left by the time he was asked ( the day after the attack ) because they had been smashed into smaller pieces by the impact and then burned up ; all that remained were smaller pieces visible only from the interior of the pentagon . <PARA> 7 ) can you find the aircraft ’ s point of impact ? <PARA> immediately after flight 77 smashed into the pentagon , the impact was obscured by a huge fireball , explosions , fire , smoke , and water from firefighting efforts . within a half hour , the upper stories of the building collapsed , thereby permanently obscuring the impact site . it simply wasn ’ t possible for photographs to capture a clear view of the impact site during that brief interval between the crash and the collapse . <PARA> in photographs like the one provided ( below left ), the impact site is obscured by water from firefighters ’ hoses and smoke . a two - story high impact hole does exist right behind the fireman in the photograph , but it ’ s covered over by water issuing from the fire truck . <PARA> by the time the smoke and water cleared , additional portions of the building had collapsed ( below right ), further obscuring the impact point .

false	no real evidence exists to defend the claim that walt disney ’ s natural parents were anyone other than flora and elias disney ( shown above ). support for walt disney ’ s having spanish parentage is based solely on fragmentary and contradictory bits of hearsay and rumor , without the backing of a single piece of substantive documentation . <PARA> one version of the legend , as recounted by mosley , identifies a young woman named consuela suarez from the spanish town of mojacar ( or mojacca ) as disney ’ s “ real ” mother . señorita suarez , the story goes , was engaged to a young man from her village who was killed in morocco before the marriage could take place , leaving her unwed and pregnant . after giving birth , consuela allegedly enlisted the aid of a local priest to arrange for an american couple to take the child back to the usa , where she ( having arrived later ) “ signed the papers which enabled her son to be formally adopted and made a us citizen .” only shortly before her death , when she finally returned to her native spain , did conseula learn that the son she had given up many years before was now the world - famous walt disney . <PARA> the tale is charming as a modern - day fairy tale , but it hardly stands up to critical examination . why did conseula suarez give up her child for adoption ? presumably it was to avoid the scandal of being an unwed mother in a primarily catholic country , yet both señorita suarez and her son immediately relocated to america , where no one would have known about the circumstances of the child ’ s birth , thus allowing her to keep her son without fear of censure . and who was this mystery couple who brought consuela ’ s son to america ? certainly not flora and elias disney , who never visited spain and had no ties of any kind to that country . how and why did this couple come in contact with the disneys ? the question also remains ( regardless of how the child came to the usa ) as to why the disneys , who could barely make ends meet and already had three sons of their own , would adopt a stranger ’ s child . ( the notion that flora and elias might have adopted a child because of their own inability to produce further offspring is belied by the fact that flora gave birth to a daughter a few years later .) lastly , where are the adoption and naturalization records for this mystery child ? local adoption papers might disappear ( or be made to disappear ), but not so federal citizenship records . <PARA> marc eliot revived this legend in a more expansive ( and a much more contrived and convoluted ) form in walt disney : hollywood ’ s dark prince . in eliot ’ s version , walt disney ’ s “ real ” mother was a washerwoman named isabelle zamora ( ascensio ) from mojacar , who became pregnant by a man from the same village , the already married dr . josé guirao . dr . guirao , who passed away shortly after the child ’ s birth , named his son after himself ; señora zamora left spain with the child and headed for the east coast of the united states soon afterwards , claims eliot , “ because she and dr . guirao were devout catholics and wished to protect both their families .” ( why a couple desirous of protecting their families from the scandal of an out of wedlock birth would draw attention to their adulterous affair by naming their child after its father remains unexplained .) isabelle eventually made her way to the west coast , where she was “ taken in by franciscan missionaries .” <PARA> even if we proceed from the assumption that señora zamora and her child actually existed , the legend breaks down when any attempt is made to link them to flora and elias disney . eliot claims that elias disney met up with señora zamora in 1890 , after he “ took leave of his wife and children . . . to take part in the second wave of the california gold rush ,” not returning home until early in 1891 . elias ’ departure for california is apparently a fact known only to eliot , for no other source of biographical information about the disney family mentions it . ( indeed , there is no evidence that elias disney ventured anywhere close the west coast after moving his family to chicago in 1889 , and eliot offers no source for his assertion that elias made such a trip . mosley does write that elias once set out for the california goldfields with his father and brother , but that was in 1878 , and elias reportedly made it no further west than kansas .) how elias managed to father a different child ( raymond arnold disney , born late in 1890 ) with his wife flora — despite spending the year away from her — is another inconsistency for which eliot offers no explanation . <PARA> let ’ s say señora zamora and her child were real , and elias disney somehow managed to end up in california and meet up with them in 1890 . why would elias disney , already married and the father of three sons , offer to adopt this spanish washerwoman ’ s child ? the answer is simple , says eliot : elias disney had an affair with señora zamora in california , brought her back with him to chicago as a “ kept woman ,” then forced flora to raise the child as their own to avoid the shame and humiliation that would befall them if his scandalous affair were revealed . ( hedging his bets at this point , eliot suggest that perhaps señora zamora ’ s child wasn ’ t born until after her arrival in america , maybe even as the result of an affair with elias disney . these hypotheses , of course , completely contradict eliot ’ s earlier explanations of why and how señora zamora came to be in america in the first place .) but one simple fact demolishes this theory : walt disney was born in 1901 , not 1890 . eliot is left with a gap of over ten years between elias ’ alleged affair with señora zamora and walt ’ s birth . <PARA> eliot disingenuously tries to skirt around the eleven - year discrepancy by pointing out that there is no official record of walt disney ’ s birth in cook country , illinois , on the birthdate that has always been claimed for him ( december 5 , 1901 ), yet there is a record of a “ walter disney ” having been born to flora and elias disney more than ten years earlier , on january 8 , 1891 . this , eliot deceptively argues , demonstrates that walt disney ’ s official date of birth has been manipulated in an attempt to cover up his true origins . the official record of birth from cook county on which eliot bases his claim does not report the birth of someone named “ walter disney ” on january 8 , 1891 , however ; it merely shows that the birth of someone by that name was recorded on that date . the actual date of birth for the person named is clearly printed on the same document : december 30 , 1890 . not coincidentally , this is the exact birth date of one of walt ’ s older brothers , raymond arnold disney . the birth record refers to raymond ’ s birth , not walt ’ s . for whatever reason , disney ’ s parents , after initially deciding to name their second son walter elias , changed their minds and christened him raymond arnold instead . <PARA> the discrepancy in birth records is not difficult to explain . birth certificates were not required by law in illinois at the turn of the century , and official paperwork for a child born at home without a doctor in attendance ( as walt was ) often went unfiled . the lack of a birth certificate for walt disney is therefore not unusual . ( despite mosley ’ s statement that disney “ was indubitably a native - born american as his birth certificate , a copy of which can still be obtained in chicago , will testify ,” no birth certificate for walt disney is known to exist .) the confusion of names on the record of raymond ’ s birth cannot be definitively explained , but most likely either flora and elias disney had not firmly agreed on a name for their son at the time the birth was recorded , or else they later changed their minds . ( mosley reports a similar disagreement between flora and elias disney over the choice of name for their third son , roy oliver disney .) quite possibly the disneys had intended to honor a promise they made to their preacher , walter parr , to name their next son after him , but then decided against it . several years later — perhaps as a belated fulfillment of that promise — they named their fourth son walter . <PARA> that walt disney was born in 1901 , not 1890 , is beyond dispute . even though a birth certificate might not exist , photographs and school records clearly demonstrate that walt was not more than ten years older than commonly believed . he could not possibly be the result of a liaison between señora zamora and elias disney that occurred in 1890 . even if eliot were wrong about the date and the two hooked up in 1900 or 1901 ( although , once again , this contradicts eliot ’ s earlier explanations of how and why zamora came to be in america in the first place ), a baby resulting from that union could simply not have been passed off as flora and elias ’ s own child , unless we are to believe that nobody — not friends , not relatives , not fellow church members , not even the disneys ’ own children — ever noticed that flora “ gave birth ” to a child without having been pregnant in the first place .
false	in early august 2017 , articles appeared on unreliable web sites reporting that two of the most popular entertainers in pop music , justin bieber and katy perry , had made public statements asserting that the music industry is run by pedophiles . ( note : we recognize that pedophilia , which is defined as a sexual attraction to children , is not the same as child sexual abuse , although the web sites under discussion do not observe that distinction .) <PARA> a yournewswire story written by dmitry baxter ( one of the promulgators of the thoroughly discredited “ pizzagate ” conspiracy theory claiming in 2016 that hillary clinton and other “ washington elites ” ran a pedophile ring out of a pizza restaurant in the nation ’ s capitol ) intimated that the reason bieber canceled the last leg of his 2017 world tour in july was his realization that pedophilia is rampant in the entertainment business : <PARA> one day later , a similar article about katy perry was posted on the web site neon nettle ( another hardcore purveyor of “ pizzagate ” rumors , not to mention articles falsely attributing statements about show business pedophilia to actor brad pitt and implying connections between the deaths of alt - rockers chris cornell and chester bennington and music industry child abusers ): <PARA> the article goes on to paint a picture virtually identical to that in the yournewswire article of industry pedophiles making up an “ exclusive club ”: <PARA> despite the fact that both stories include elements of truth to shore up their credibility — justin bieber did cancel part of his 2017 tour , for example , and katy perry did say in a live - streamed therapy session that she doesn ’ t want to be “ katy perry ” anymore ( i . e ., in the sense of having to live up to fans ’ expectations ) — in neither case are the statements attributed to them about pedophilia sufficiently sourced or corroborated to earn readers ’ credence . no such statements by bieber and perry have been quoted ( or even mentioned ) by any mainstream news outlets . <PARA> on the contrary , these statements are lurid fabrications designed either to garner social media likes and shares ( and advertising dollars ), or spread disinformation intended to harm the reputations of so - called “ hollywood elites ” ( a favorite political target of both yournewswire and neon nettle ), or both . <PARA> unfortunately , by disseminating these false stories , the web sites dilute and lend confusion to the impact of actual claims of industry pedophilia made by the likes of former child actors corey feldman and elijah wood , who have separately gone on record saying the extent to which the sexual abuse of minors occurs in hollywood is underreported . <PARA> worse , child abuse is one of those emotion - laden topics that can lead to violence , so there ’ s no room for false reporting . one would hope that lessons were learned from the pizzagate debacle , which resulted in a credulous fake news reader firing an ar - 15 rifle inside washington dc ’ s comet ping pong , a family restaurant ; the shooter said he expected to rescue “ child sex slaves ” from a pedophile ring that does not exist , which was purportedly run out of the restaurant ’ s basement , which also does not exist . <PARA> we reached out to representatives of justin bieber and kate perry for comment , but did not hear back before publication time .

mixture	in mid - april 2018 , a months - old claim that the u . s . had 3 . 5 million more registered voters than “ live adults ” reappeared on social media . that claim appears to have originated with a national review article of 11 august 2017 that built on information compiled by judicial watch ’ s election integrity project : <PARA> even if these numbers are assumed to be accurate , presenting them as definitively demonstrating that “ some 3 . 5 million more people are registered to vote in the u . s . than are alive among america ’ s adult citizens ” is a questionable and problematic claim , given that the information was compiled from only 462 counties in 38 states , yet the entire u . s . comprises over 3 , 000 counties in fifty states . many of those other counties might well have substantially fewer registered voters on their rolls than adult residents who are eligible to vote . <PARA> another major issue with such a claim is the potential inclusion of “ inactive ” voters among the tallies of registered voters , a matter that was publicized in a 1 august 2017 letter judicial watch sent to california secretary of state alex padilla threatening to sue unless the state and eleven of its counties produced voter records to them . according to judicial watch , their own analysis of u . s . census data and voter registration records indicated those eleven counties included numbers of registered voters exceeding the numbers of adults eligible to vote in those counties . <PARA> in december 2017 , judicial watch made good on their threat , initiating litigation that is currently in progress in u . s . district court , central district of california . the lawsuit accuses california and multiple jurisdictions of violating the national voter registration act of 1993 ( nvra ) by failing to maintain updated voter registration rolls . <PARA> stories based on judicial watch ’ s letter initially made internet waves in late summer 2017 via right - leaning blogs and kremlin propaganda networks . in april 2018 , another version of the claim went viral in the form of an editorial published months ago by the financial publication investors business daily : <PARA> many articles used that information to imply widespread voter fraud was taking place , an unfounded claim regularly invoked by president donald trump . <PARA> however , as multiple news organizations have already pointed out , the accusation of voter registration irregularities in california rests on the manner in which judicial watch counted california voters , combining active and inactive voters on a county - by - county basis : <PARA> the consideration of inactive voters is a key issue here . judicial watch maintains that registrations listed on state rolls as “ inactive ” are “ vulnerable to abuse ” by “ voters who plan to fraudulently double - vote in two different jurisdictions on the same election day ,” or by third parties “ because a voter who has moved to a different state is unlikely to monitor the use of or communications concerning an old registration .” <PARA> however , california ’ s national voter registration act ( nvra ) regulations state that although inactive voters remain on the rolls as registered voters who are eligible to vote , they do not receive “ mailed election materials ” ( including mail - in ballots ) and must “ confirm residency at the polling place ” in person in order to vote — standards that would severely limit or eliminate double - voting or the ability of third parties to fraudulently use inactive registrations to cast ballots : <PARA> the california secretary of state ’ s office confirmed to us directly that “ the only way for inactive voters to obtain a ballot is for them to request a ballot in person at either a county elections office or at a polling location .” <PARA> kristen clarke , president and executive director of the lawyer ’ s committee for civil rights under law , told us efforts such as the one undertaken by judicial watch and a similar one undertaken by another non - profit , the public interest legal foundation ( pilf ), are not meant to strengthen election systems but rather to bully election officials into purging voter rolls , in contrast to both the spirit and letter of federal election laws . <PARA> often , she said , such figures produced by the likes of judicial watch and pilf fail to account for things such as active military members or students attending university away from their home jurisdictions that may affect figures and numbers in different ways : <PARA> clarke added that u . s . census data is not a reliable measure of eligible voting population , and that <PARA> inactive voters can only be removed from rolls under specific circumstances , as noted in a memo sent from her organization to the 248 jurisdictions targeted by pilf : <PARA> when all of california ( rather than eleven select counties ) is taken into account , the figures offered in a 2 january 2018 report issued by the secretary of state ’ s office list more than 25 million adults eligible to vote residing in california , but fewer than 19 million registered voters . the state would have to encompass more than 6 million “ ghost voters ” on its rolls for the number of registered voters to exceed the number of eligible adults . <PARA> moreover , in the 2016 presidential election , democratic candidate hillary clinton won the state of california by more than 3 . 4 million votes over her closest competitor , republican donald trump . virtually every single one of the claimed 3 . 5 million “ ghost voters ” in the entire u . s . would have had to come to california and cast fraudulent votes in order to be responsible for that outcome . <PARA> the trope that upwards of 3 million people voted illegally in the 2016 presidential election is so persistent that it resulted in a now - defunct voter fraud commission , which was quietly disbanded in january 2018 without presenting any evidence of widespread voter fraud .
false	on 5 march 2019 , a conspiracy - minded twitter account shared a video purporting to be from the site of a construction project funded by west virginia taxpayer money for the purpose of housing 321 syrian refugees . the video also claimed this was being done at the expense of “ regular ” americans who , the man claims , were being pushed into “ substandard housing .” he asserted that the area he was standing in will be a “ sharia zone ,” and no non - muslims will be allowed to enter : <PARA> several factual problems exist with assertions in this video . chief among them is the fact that this video shows the littlepage terrace housing project , a low - income , housing tax - credit property allocated through the west virginia housing development fund , which houses zero syrian refugees and many “ regular ” americans . several lines of evidence support this conclusion . first , someone who works next to the project refers to it as littlepage : <PARA> second , a wider , composite view of the man ’ s video shows clearly identifiable markers of the littlepage housing complex , including a tell - tale smokestack and buildings that exactly match the structures built at littlepage : <PARA> for comparison , here ’ s video shot at littlepage : <PARA> third , mark taylor , the chief executive officer of charleston - kanawha housing authority , which works with the littlepage terrace project , confirmed to us by email that the suspect video was taken at that site during renovations that likely occurred in may 2017 . he also confirmed to us that the community houses no syrian refugees . <PARA> another significant oversight in the tweeted narrative is that the entire state of west virginia has taken in far less than 321 syrian refugees in total . in 2016 , the year the united states took in the largest number of syrian refugees , west virginia resettled only five of them in their state . on 1 february 2017 , the trump administration announced executive order 13769 , commonly referred to as the “ travel ban ,” which indefinitely suspended the admission of syrian refugees to the united states . in 2017 , west virginia took in 13 refugees , but these individuals were not necessarily syrian . <PARA> it is true that littlepage was torn down and rebuilt , but that decision had nothing to do with refugee housing . instead , the renovations aimed to “ reduce crime and revitalize the area ,” as reported by west virginia ’ s wchs television station in 2016 : <PARA> because the housing complex displayed was not built for syrian refugees , and because the state has taken virtually no syrian refugees at all , we rank the claims made in this video as aggressively and demonstrably false .
unproven	when most people see a stray pit bull running around , they get nervous , and even scared . although on this day , he was angela ’ s guardian angel . a 65 pound male pit bull charged the man and drove him off . <PARA> “ i don ’ t think the dog physically attacked the man , but he went at him and was showing signs of aggression , just baring his teeth and growling and barking . it was clear he was trying to defend this woman ,” animal control lt . brian jones told pet pulse . <PARA> the remarkable part of this story is this dog had never seen angela before , and selflessly defended them . the dog probably saved their lives . <PARA> after the man ran away , angela grabbed her child and ran to get in the car to drive away , when the dog jumped into the backseat . they then waited for police . <PARA> angela says if the dog ’ s owners do not come forward to take him home , they will be adopting him . angela calls him their “ angel ”, which will be his name if they are able to adopt him . sometimes these stories get lost in the mix , i thought this was a wonderful dog and wanted to share this story with you . i hope you get the warm , fuzzy feeling i get when reading this . animals are amazing . <PARA> origins : this story of a florida woman and her two -

pound pit bull mix might have seemed menacing to some passerby , but one woman will always remember him as her “ guardian angel .” <PARA> the dog , which authorities think is lost and not a stray , successfully thwarted a robbery attack on a mother and her 2 - year - old son , who were held at knifepoint . <PARA> the florida woman , who has been identified by authorities simply as “ angela ,” was leaving a playground with her toddler son in port charlotte when a man approached her in the parking lot with a knife and told her not to make any noise or sudden movements . <PARA> angela didn ’ t have to do either to protect herself and her child — a dog mysteriously ran to the scene and charged the man , who quickly fled . <PARA> “ i don ’ t think the dog physically attacked the man , but he went at him and was showing signs of aggression , just baring his teeth and growling and barking . it was clear he was trying to defend this woman ,” animal control lt . brian jones told pet pulse . <PARA> “ i don ’ t know what this man ’ s intentions were , but it is very possible this dog saved her life .” <PARA> the exceptional part of the story , jones said , is that the dog had never met or even seen the people it quickly jumped to defend . <PARA> “ you hear about family dogs protecting their owners , but this dog had nothing to do with this woman or her kid ,” jones said . “ he was like her guardian angel .” <PARA> after the alleged thief ran away , angela quickly placed her son , jordan , in the car and tried to drive off . before she could , though , the dog jumped into her backseat , waiting with her for the police and animal control officers to arrive at the scene . <PARA> the dog was transported to a local shelter and if his owners don ’ t step forward within five days , jones said , angela and her family plan to adopt the savior she named “ angel .” <PARA> animal control officers and shelter workers believe angel is lost , and not a stray , because of his good health , sturdy weight and mild temperament . <PARA> “ it ’ s funny , that someone ’ s irresponsibility could have saved someone ’ s life ,” jones said of angel ’ s possible owners . <PARA> for angela , it doesn ’ t matter where the dog came from , just that he was there when she needed him most . <PARA> “ i don ’ t know what his [ the thief ’ s ] intentions were — i don ’ t know why he did it , but i ’ m glad that — we call him angel — i ’ m glad that angel showed up because i don ’ t know what would have happened ,” angela told nbc2 news . <PARA> for a small town with a population of 46 , 452 , animal control officers were kept busy monday afternoon . jones says they department also responded to a report about a boa constrictor in a church parking lot . <PARA> the snake found its way into a car engine and was able to be removed without being harmed . it took three people to move the massive , seemingly random placed snake . <PARA> “ it ’ s funny , because we aren ’ t a big place ,” he said of the gulf coast town . “ and we can go for four or five months without the media contacting us about a story . it ’ s been a busy week .” <PARA> officers from the responding county sheriff ’ s office canvased the area and were unable to locate the suspect described as being in his 20s , tall and dark haired . <PARA> the dog , which authorities think is lost and not a stray , successfully thwarted a robbery attack on a mother and her 2 -

wielding assailant who was driven away by a stray pit bull , and that she did turn a pit bull over to authorities , there is no way to independently verify her story , as no one other than her toddler was present to witness the alleged assault , and the police never turned up a suspect . <PARA> some critics have expressed skepticism at the notion of a stray pit bull ’ s fortuitously arriving at the scene of a crime and driving away an attacker to protect a stranger and then conveniently hopping into that stranger ’ s car and patiently waiting with her for the arrival of authorities , suggesting that the scenario sounds more indicative of a woman scheming to get rid of her pet dog . when angel the pit bull was subsequently transferred to midwest animal rescue ( mars ) in minneapolis , minnesota , to undergo a course of treatment for heartworms and find placement in a new home , officials there expressed similar skepticism about the pit bull ’ s back story : <PARA> angel ’ s ordeal began nov . 3 , when a woman claimed that a man grabbed her and held a knife to her throat as she and her toddler tried to leave higgs park in port charlotte . she told police that the 69 - pound pit bull mix came out of the nearby woods and scared off the attacker . <PARA> the dog then jumped into her car before she drove home . charlotte county sheriff ’ s office spokesman bob carpenter said deputies never found the attacker . the dog was later taken to charlotte county animal control . <PARA> animal rescuers at mars saw pet pulse ’ s nov . 5 article about angel and were immediately skeptical about the alleged victim ’ s story . the dog would not protect someone it did not know , they believed . <PARA> angel ’ s docile nature offered further indication that he would not have charged the alleged attacker , as the victim in the florida incident had claimed . <PARA> they can ’ t prove it , but mars rescuers still believe that the attack never happened and that the incident was a ruse so the woman could dump her dog , perhaps hoping a hero would stand a better chance of finding a new home . <PARA> the dog then jumped into her car before she drove home . charlotte county sheriff ’ s office spokesman bob carpenter said deputies never found the attacker . the dog was later taken to charlotte county animal control . <PARA> animal rescuers at mars saw pet pulse ’ s nov . 5 article about angel and were immediately skeptical about the alleged victim ’ s story . the dog would not protect someone it did not know , they believed . <PARA> angel ’ s docile nature offered further indication that he would not have charged the alleged attacker , as the victim in the florida incident had claimed . <PARA> they can ’ t prove it , but mars rescuers still believe that the attack never happened and that the incident was a ruse so the woman could dump her dog , perhaps hoping a hero would stand a better chance of finding a new home . <PARA> according to mars , angel was put down on 8 march 2009 due to complications from heartworms : <PARA> angel , a beautiful , happy , loving american bulldog was taken on his final walk across the rainbow bridge on sunday march 8 , 2009 . unfortunate complications led to this very difficult decision . he was such a great boy ! he dearly loved his family and anyone who would give him attention , liked to play ball , and eat all the treats you would let him . he just loved his new life as a “ dog ”. he was truly amazing . always curious and no matter what was going on , he was able to look you in the eye and make you chuckle because you could only imagine what he was thinking and knew that if he got the chance he would get into something . hence , his nickname ... chaos . angel came to mars from florida where he had been dumped at a local pound . he was heartworm positive , but he knew that someone would come to be his “ angel ”. so , he never gave up hope and continued to fight for a good life . that ’ s when he came to minnesota and was able to successfully withstand the effects of the harsh heartworm treatment all while keeping his head up the entire time . no one wanted to see him go . he was a great success to have seen and loved by so many of us . he was kept company by steve , amanda , and chris when he crossed over the bridge and got to enjoy a tasty mcgriddle sandwich with hash browns before he left us . he never once fought the medication because he knew that it was his time to go to his forever home across the bridge . god truly called back one of his angel ’ s . we ’ ll miss you angel , but your memory will stay in our hearts until we meet again ...

false	did you receive your medicare handbook for 2015 yesterday ? if you have already received yours in the mail please turn to page 12 and go down to the bottom of the page and read find out what you pay for medicare ( part a and part b ) . it states that the premium and deductible amounts were not available at the time of printing . it further states you may call 1 - 800 - 633 - 4227 to get the most up - to - date info . <PARA> i did just that and talked with a medicare representative . she told me that they probably would not have those figures in until the end of the first week or possibly the second week of november . <PARA> now , let that sink in ! <PARA> as soon as she stated that to me i replied , “ my , isn ’ t that convenient for the obama administration to actually hold off on those figures until after the 2014 election results .” <PARA> there was dead silence on the other end of the line . i told her thank you and that i would call back . <PARA> you see on our social security increase for next year we are only receiving an increase of around 1 %. even the military are getting just over 1 %. you can bet after the november 4th election the increases for medicare a & b will be greater than any 1 %. that is why they are delaying what the increases will be . because if they had put it in that handbook , any elderly would be voting against the democrats . <PARA> so anyone voting for the democrats in the forthcoming elections deserves to get the increases that are coming after november 4th . <PARA> origins : in mid - october 2014 , the chain e - mail reproduced above began circulating widely . in that message , the writer claimed he or she was informed by a representative at the medicare helpline that information about 2015 medicare part a and part b premiums and <PARA> deductibles would not made be available to seniors until late in 2014 , after the midterm elections . <PARA> in the weeks leading up to the 2014 elections , the medicare handbook e - mail caused concern among those who might be affected by last - minute increases in their medicare rates ; and it contained a kernel of truth in that the originally - provided version of the 2015 medicare handbook did state exact rates for 2015 were not available at the time of printing . <PARA> the e - mail was posted across the internet and in a few “ letters to the editor ” columns in late october 2014 , often attributed to “ a friend ” or “ a retired detective .” as the writer stated , page 12 of the 2015 medicare handbook [ pdf ] featured the header “ what ’ s important in 2015 ,” under which it explained : <PARA> find out what you pay for medicare ( part a and part b ) <PARA> the 2015 medicare premium and deductible amounts weren ’ t available at the time of printing . to get the most up - to - date cost information , visit medicare . gov or call 1 - 800 - medicare ( 1 - 800 - 633 - 4227 ). tty users should call 1 - 877 - 486 - 2048 . <PARA> the 2015 medicare premium and deductible amounts weren ’ t available at the time of printing . to get the most up - to - date cost information , visit medicare . gov or call 1 - 800 - medicare ( 1 - 800 - 633 - 4227 ). tty users should call 1 - 877 - 486 - 2048 . <PARA> however , the claims made after the “ turn to page 12 ′′ portion of the e - mail are easy to resolve . while the letter writer insinuated 2015 medicare rates were deliberately being withheld until the midterm elections concluded , medicare . gov proves that claim to be false . <PARA> in fact , according to that site , medicare 2015 part a monthly premium rates are not only available for viewing now but will be lower in 2015 than they were the previous year ; and 2015 medicare part b costs are also available on the site now for all to see the premiums set at precisely the same rate for 2015 as they were in 2014 . <PARA> an article published on 10 october 2014 , predating the circulation of the chain e - mail , explained some 2015 medicare rate changes in depth : <PARA> medicare part b premiums will be $ 104 . 90 per month in 2015 , which is the same as the 2014 premiums . the part b deductible will also remain the same for 2015 , at $ 147 . the medicare part a deductible , which covers the first 60 days of medicare - covered inpatient hospital care , will rise to $ 1 , 260 in 2015 , a $ 44 increase from 2014 . the daily coinsurance rate for days 21 through 100 in a skilled nursing facility will also increase slightly , to $ 157 . 50 in 2015 . <PARA> additional cost breakdowns for medicare in 2015 are available on medicare . gov . <PARA> in summary : while the 2015 medicare handbook did not have specific rates at hand at the time it was printed , that information is readily available online via medicare . gov ; and it was released well before the 2014 midterm elections and not withheld until after voting had concluded .
true	in february 2020 , rush limbaugh announced he had been diagnosed with “ advanced lung cancer ,” prompting widespread reflection on the controversial and influential conservative talk radio host ’ s career , as well as renewed scrutiny of his past pronouncements . <PARA> in light of limbaugh ’ s lung cancer diagnosis , some of his detractors suggested that a measure of irony was at work , given his previous statements on smoking and nicotine . in particular , some social media users shared the following quotation , attributed to limbaugh : <PARA> “ there is no conclusive proof that nicotine ’ s addictive ... and the same thing with cigarettes causing emphysema , lung cancer , heart disease .” <PARA> social media users posted several memes containing the same quotation , including the following az quotes graphic : <PARA> the statement first emerged in 1994 , when the left - leaning non - profit organization fairness and accuracy in reporting ( fair ) published an in - depth examination of several dozen false and misleading claims made by limbaugh on his radio and television shows , in his books , and elsewhere . the july / august edition of fair ’ s newsletter extra ! contained a report with the headline “ the way things aren ’ t — rush limbaugh debates reality .” <PARA> in the “ weird science ” section of the eight - page article , fair highlighted the following claim , made by limbaugh during the april 29 , 1994 , episode of his radio program “ the rush limbaugh show ”: <PARA> “ there is no conclusive proof that nicotine ’ s addictive ...[ or with ] cigarettes causing emphysema , lung cancer , heart disease .” <PARA> fair refuted those assertions as follows : <PARA> by that time , limbaugh was already a leading conservative voice in american media , and his radio show was syndicated to hundreds of stations across the country . fair ’ s exposé made a splash and garnered news coverage by major outlets including the associated press . <PARA> the lengthy magazine article later formed the basis for a book entitled “ the way things aren ’ t : rush limbaugh ’ s reign of error ,” which was published in 1995 and debunked more than 100 of limbaugh ’ s falsehoods . <PARA> one of the book ’ s authors , steve rendall , told snopes the tape recordings he had made of limbaugh ’ s radio broadcasts during that era had not survived the intervening 26 years , and therefore could not be consulted . similarly , we did not find any official transcript of the april 29 , 1994 , episode . ( limbaugh ’ s website features an archive of thousands of recordings and transcripts of his shows , but it only stretches back to the year 2000 ). <PARA> however , limbaugh effectively confirmed the authenticity of the quotation and reiterated the same point in a lengthy rebuttal of fair ’ s article , which the organization itself printed . limbaugh wrote ( emphasis added ): <PARA> in saying that “ nicotine ’ s addictiveness ... is ... a source of tremendous controversy ,” limbaugh was effectively reiterating the claim that “ there is no conclusive proof that nicotine ’ s addictive .” in his rebuttal , he also did not dispute in any way that fair ’ s quoting of him was accurate . <PARA> so while we cannot consult the original audio recording or an official transcript to verify whether limbaugh ’ s exact wording was as fair presented it , we can confirm that fair gave a proper presentation of limbaugh ’ s views on that specific issue , because the radio host effectively restated them shortly afterwards , and never disputed the wording presented by fair . <PARA> limbaugh ’ s views on the addictiveness of nicotine have since changed . in a july 2004 episode of his radio show , he said nicotine was “ the most addictive drug , substance , whatever , on the planet ,” but argued that it might have other health benefits . in september 2019 , he again described nicotine as “ the most addictive drug on earth ,” but argued in favor of electronic cigarettes on the basis that the liquids they use do not produce the carcinogens produced by traditional , combustible tobacco cigarettes .
true	on 11 february 2019 , bianca coons and christopher ruiz of idaho filed a lawsuit in albuquerque , new mexico , against planned parenthood over a failed abortion that resulted in the birth of a baby boy . according to court documents , the couple , who were already parents to two small children , cited “ extreme poverty ” as a reason for their seeking a “ medically assisted ” ( or non - surgical ) abortion in an effort to limit the size of their family . <PARA> the story was soon picked up by a number of partisan websites such as lifesitenews , who reported the story in emotional terms : <PARA> these hypothetical details may have inspired some readers to question whether the underlying event itself was true , and a review of court documents shows that coons and ruiz did indeed file suit against planned parenthood for damages over a failed abortion that resulted in the birth of their third child . <PARA> according to the lawsuit filed in new mexico , the couple felt they could not afford to add another child to their family , so on 12 february 2016 , when coons was about five or six weeks pregnant , they traveled from their home in idaho to a planned parenthood clinic in albuquerque in hopes that an abortion procedure could be performed quickly before the fetus developed any further . the couple made the journey , court records said , in order to avoid a state - mandated waiting period . ( in idaho , a woman must wait 24 hours after receiving “ state - directed counseling that includes information designed to discourage her from having an abortion ” before undergoing the procedure .) coons wanted the procedure done expeditiously before the fetus developed any further . <PARA> coons and her family used “ all economic resources available to them at the time to pay the $ 400 fee for the abortion and make the trip ,” according to court documents . she took the first pill in the two - pill regimen at planned parenthood , was given instruction for “ further oral administration ,” and then returned home to boise . <PARA> the next day coons visited a hospital emergency room complaining of nausea and dizziness . she was treated for dehydration , and medical staff there told her that her fetus had a strong heartbeat . the doctor caring for her called the albuquerque clinic asking whether she should continue with the second abortion pill and received an affirmative answer . <PARA> according to court documents , even after taking both doses of the abortion - inducing drugs , coons was still pregnant with a viable fetus , but she didn ’ t have the financial means to pay for another procedure in idaho or return to new mexico to follow up with the clinic that gave her the medication . <PARA> coons contacted the planned parenthood facility in albuquerque in early march 2016 to inform them she was still pregnant , but by that time she felt morally opposed to continuing the effort to undergo an abortion due to the more advanced stage of development of the fetus . <PARA> the couple was notified that the abortion medication could result in birth defects , causing them to live with the fear their son could develop resulting health issues later in life . coons gave birth to a premature baby boy who had jaundice and blood - sugar problems , according to court documents . <PARA> coons and ruiz are suing for $ 765 , 000 in compensatory damages for alleged negligence and breach of contract , according to court documents . we reached out to planned parenthood for comment and have not received a response , but a spokesperson for the organization told the albuquerque journal they could not comment on pending litigation or discuss specific patients due to privacy concerns .
mixture	on august 3 , 2019 , twenty people were reportedly killed and over two dozen more injured in a mass shooting at an el paso shopping center . early news reports indicated that a 21 - year - old man named patrick crusius had been taken into custody in connection with the shooting . <PARA> soon afterwards , social media users circulated a photograph showing the word “ trump ” spelled out by a variety of firearms along with a claim that the picture had appeared in the twitter account of the suspect ( as something he had posted or shared ): <PARA> uncertainty about the identity of the suspect , which social media accounts ( if any ) may genuinely have been tied to him , and the possible quick deletion of those accounts made this claim difficult to immediately verify . the image was not actually created by the perpetrator of that shooting just beforehand , as it had been online for well over two years before the incident . <PARA> early reporting suggested that the suspect ’ s twitter account had been deleted after the shooting , but that prior to deletion that account had included no posts , and “ just one photo ” which was a profile picture and not an image of firearms arranged to spell “ trump ”: <PARA> a screenshot we grabbed of the twitter account in question before its deletion showed a tweet of the image ( posted by someone else ) was among the items “ liked ” by that account back in early 2017 : <PARA> president trump himself condemned the shooting as an “ act of cowardice ” and a “ hateful act ”:

false	examples : [ collected via e - mail , 2001 and 2015 ] <PARA> pass on to anyone who may be in birmingham on october 6th <PARA> hi everyone ! <PARA> anyone that knows me well will know that i don ’ t believe in much . i don ’ t believe in ghosts or all that , and if i get one of those “ pass this email on to 50 million people and you will be rich , if you don ’ t you will die etc etc ” emails , i just delete them . i want you all to pass this email on to as many people as you know , its not a chain email , but pass it on all the same . <PARA> right then , i got home from work last night and went round to my best mates . the first words his mum said to me even before she said hello was “ don ’ t go into birmingham on october 6th ”. <PARA> she explained to me that a woman from her work was in birmingham on saturday afternoon , and she was in one of those cash and carry warehouses where you can buy cheap stuff , and anyway , there was an indian / asian looking man in front of her who was struggling to get enough money together to pay for everything in his basket , so she gave him a pound coin so he could pay the 68p or whatever he owed . <PARA> when she left the shop he was waiting for her outside . he asked her for her name and address and said that he would give her the money back , but she told him not to worry about it . he then said “ ok , you have done me a good turn today so i shall do you one back , do not come into birmingham town centre on october the 6th ”. <PARA> she didn ’ t take much notice of him , but like me , the more she thought about it , the more she worried , so she went to the police . they took her very seriously and showed her mug shots of known islamic supporters and members of extreme groups in birmingham , and she saw the man in the book of mugshots . <PARA> so , i ’ m just warning you , if you were going to go to brum town centre on the 6th of october , then i wouldn ’ t . i wasn ’ t going to send this because i didn ’ t want to worry people / look stupid when nothing happened on oct 6th , but i thought that if i didn ’ t say anything and something happened then i would never forgive myself , so its worth the risk of looking a bit daft . also , the 6th of october is the england / greece game , when there are likely to be a lot of people in town ’ s pubs n bars watching it , so if they wanted to do something nasty , it would be a good time . <PARA> please pass this on to anyone you think might go into birmingham town centre on the 6th of october . if you don ’ t pass this email on , you will not get bad luck , and if you pass it on to more than 5 people you won ’ t get good luck , but you might stop someone from getting caught up in whatever supposed to be going on on october the 6th . this is not a chain e - mail . <PARA> this came from a friend of my sisters this morning : <PARA> morning all – had a bizarre message from my brother in the early hours this morning ... <PARA> his friend ’ s girlfriend was shopping in harrods on the weekend . there was an arab man in front of her who was buying a number of things with cash – he was a few pounds short so the girl offered him £ 3 to cover it . he thanked her profusely and left . when she left the store the man followed her out and thanked her again and then warned her not to travel on the tube today !! ( monday 1st october ) she was a little thrown by this so she went to the police . the police were very sceptical but in order to eliminate her suspicions gave her the photo - id book of all known dissidents in the uk . he was on the second page listed as a known terrorist . <PARA> this is apparently true and the police are apparently taking this extremely seriously . the most likely time would be rush hour this evening so please avoid it if you can – who knows it may be nothing but is it worth <PARA> the risk ? <PARA> ps – i don ’ t have a lot of people ’ s e - mail addresses so obviously please forward this on to anyone and everyone <PARA> just heard from jackie – this is a very eerie story . a co - worker just told her that she and her husband were shopping at a costco last night and they were checking out behind an arab couple . the arabs did not have enough money to pay their bill so she offered to give them the money . they said we can ’ t pay you back but we can give you some information instead . they said to stay away from the baltimore tunnels ( specifically , the harbor tunnel ) for the next few days . she called the fbi and they showed her the new most wanted list that just came out and he was one of them – the fbi has not been able to find him – he ’ s apparently still living in laurel . this woman was so upset that she came to work today and then went home . <PARA> it amazing that these people are living amongst us and even with their families and kids in our schools . anyway , jackie said they are checking all trucks going into and out of the balt . tunnels . she advised staying away from baltimore period through this weekend at least . tell anyone you think might be affected by this . <PARA> there is a message circulating on facebook about a muslim lady who dropped her purse in birmingham , and lady picked it up and gave it back to her , she thanked her and then told her ” don ’ t go on the train on december 12th ” scaremongering or warning ? birmingham will be packed with shoppers <PARA> origins : tales about grateful arabs who provided guarded hints about upcoming terrorist attacks as rewards to those who returned dropped wallets or helped them pay for small purchases in convenience stores first appeared in the final week of september 2001 . since then , these rumors have reappeared at various times in various forms , including versions that specifically warned against the drinking of coca - cola after a certain date ( which , of course , changed from telling to telling ), a uk - based outbreak in december 2006 , and text messages circulated in new york during the first week of january 2009 stating that “ a jewish woman gave a tip to a muslim taxi driver and out of appreciation he warned her not to go to manhattan next week wednesday .” <PARA> of the january 2009 text message version , the new york police department ( nypd ) said : <PARA> a chilling terror warning spreading across the u . s . and israel is a hoax , nypd officials said . <PARA> the threat , which has popped up on forwarded e - mails and blog posts across the world , warns of an attack in new york [ on january 7 ]. <PARA> it says the warning originated with a muslim cab driver who told a jewish woman he picked up of a jan . 7 plot . <PARA> “ there is no terror plot or threat connected to the rumor that is circulating in new york and in other cities abroad ,” said deputy police commissioner paul browne . <PARA> “ there are several variations on the rumor , but it is just that , the latest urban myth . there is no basis in the rumor and it is not tied to any known threats .” <PARA> the threat , which has popped up on forwarded e - mails and blog posts across the world , warns of an attack in new york [ on january 7 ]. <PARA> it says the warning originated with a muslim cab driver who told a jewish woman he picked up of a jan . 7 plot . <PARA> “ there is no terror plot or threat connected to the rumor that is circulating in new york and in other cities abroad ,” said deputy police commissioner paul browne . <PARA> “ there are several variations on the rumor , but it is just that , the latest urban myth . there is no basis in the rumor and it is not tied to any known threats .” <PARA> in may 2011 , in the wake of osama bin laden ’ s death , the “ helped terrorist ” rumor reappeared in paris . in that version , the supposedly grateful terrorist rewarded a man who had returned his dropped wallet to him with the advice not to use the paris metro the next day because an attack was going to take place . <PARA> also in may 2011 , we encountered a version in which a muslim woman attempting to find change in her purse with which to feed a parking meter near carnegie mellon university was given some quarters by another woman who was passing by . in return , the muslim woman warned her not to attend any tea party events this summer . <PARA> the rumor emerged again in the immediate aftermath of a hostage situation in sydney , australia , in december 2014 . according to the version attached to that event , the kindhearted perpetrator of imminent violence cautioned a fellow resident of sydney to avoid the city on new year ’ s eve : <PARA> the birmingham referred to in the first warning quoted in our examples section above is in the united kingdom and is not any of the many cities of same name in the united states . the rumor also existed offline in versions that variously named a number of united kingdom towns as the one the grateful terrorist cautioned the kindly <PARA> woman against visiting . depending on where the rumor was encountered , coventry , birmingham , tamworth , milton keynes , and chester were named as the definitive targets . ( such scares do tend to localize , so someone living in the birmingham area will likely hear a version that asserts great harm is about to befall birmingham , as opposed to any of the other towns commonly featured in the whisper .) the story always comes from a friend who says he heard it second or third - hand . in true urban lore fashion , the woman who had the encounter with the terrorist is never named ; only her experience is described . <PARA> following a november 2015 terror attack in paris , the rumor resurfaced once again in birmingham . in that iteration , a shopper ( the mother of a friend of a friend ) reunited a “ muslim lady ” with her dropped purse . in response , the purse ’ s owner cautioned the woman not to “ catch the train ” on 12 december 2015 . on 11 december 2015 , police in birmingham published a facebook status update regarding the “ unhelpful rumours .” <PARA> likewise , the venue for the instigating act changes from telling to telling . the man is shopping at a cheap goods store . or he ’ s picking up things at harrod ’ s . or he comes up short at a gas ( petrol ) station . or he ’ s at the local mcdonalds . sometimes he ’ s an arab , and sometimes he ’ s irish . when he ’ s irish , the presumption is that he and his group will be placing a bomb . when he ’ s an arab , generally no presumption of a specific act of terror is made ; that part remains unstated and left for the listener to imagine what will take place on the appointed day . <PARA> in october 2001 the west midlands police issued a statement about the rumor , which read ( in part ): <PARA> this rumour , with an implied security threat , bears all the hallmarks of a so - called “ urban myth ,” having no apparent basis in fact , nor any evidence to support it . west midlands police chief constable , sir edward crew , has repeated his earlier message that people should be reassured that there is no intelligence to suggest there is any specific threat to the west midlands . <PARA> although this particular rumor about birmingham and october 6 may have been of 2001 vintage , the tale of the grateful stranger rewarding a helpful citizen with a warning about impending attack was not even then a new one . other versions of the same legend surfaced years prior to 11 september 2001 , versions that featured helpful folks who assisted mysterious male strangers in small ways and were rewarded with specific cautions against being in certain places at certain times . for example , in 2000 a specific version of this legend attached itself to the trafford centre in the u . k ., a famous shopping location . according to that tale , a woman who helped a young man pay for his meal at burger king was rewarded with the advice to avoid that shopping center during the month of march . that bit of advice was supposedly delivered in a light irish accent . <PARA> some might view the “ warning stranger ” legend as a sinister form of the “ benevolent millionaire ” tale in which a small kindness performed for someone unknown to the helpful one pulls in a large reward , but it is likely more closely related to a hoary supernatural tale about kindness repaid with useful intelligence : <PARA> [ jacobson , 1948 ] <PARA> in the wake of the anxiety rumors that swept the nation immediately after pearl harbor came a pipe - dream rumor which was undoubtedly the most popular of all : the weird tale of the man who picked up a strange woman in his car . arriving at her destination , his passenger allegedly offered to pay the man for the gas he had used . but the man refused to accept the money , so the woman offered to tell his fortune . and , as the rumor went , mysteriously she told him , “ there will be a dead body in your car before you get home , and hitler will be dead in six months .” supposedly , then , on the way home the man had seen a serious automobile wreck and had taken one of the victims into his car to rush him to the hospital . but the injured person died en route , which left the hopeful implication that hitler would therefore be dead within the following six months . <PARA> although this pipe dream sounds foolish , it nevertheless spread throughout the country rapidly . it appeared in widely circulated gossip columns , and a lot of americans took it seriously . yet this same rumor , in the setting of the period , to be sure , had appeared in every military conflict since the napoleonic wars . and it has been said that the rumor probably goes back into the middle ages . <PARA> in the wake of the anxiety rumors that swept the nation immediately after pearl harbor came a pipe -

mixture	in late january 2017 , blogs began publishing celebratory posts that made it sound like legendary watergate newsman dan rather was returning to the field to defeat president donald trump in a david and goliath - like show - down . <PARA> one headline reads , “ breaking : dan rather ends retirement , announces historic project to topple trump ”: <PARA> rather did launch the facebook page ( called “ news and guts ”) in early 2017 , but his description of the newly - formed group ’ s mission was not to “ topple ” trump or anyone else so much as to counter misinformation that he says ratcheted up along with trump ’ s election . he also said that he wished to take a stand against trump ’ s combative tone toward journalists : <PARA> “ news and guts ” appears to so far be a curation of news stories from credible sources , paired with commentary and tips on how citizens can actively participate in government . the web site also serves as a central hub for rather ’ s work . to be sure , many of the posts are critical of president trump , but the now - 85 - year - old rather became famous as a reporter by taking on the executive branch directly . <PARA> rather has not retired ; he has continued his journalism work since leaving cbs news in 2004 : <PARA> rather made his name as a young reporter covering the vietnam war from the battlefields and for going toe - to - toe with powerful politicians , and has been accused by right wing publications of having a liberal bias . in 2004 , rather left his post at cbs amid accusations that an explosive report on “ 60 minutes ” about then - president george w . bush ’ s national guard record was not accurate ( texas monthly published a lengthy investigation into the affair that concluded , broadly speaking , questions remain about the 43rd president ’ s service at the end of the vietnam war but interest on it waned after bush ’ s last election to public office ).
false	on 3 september 2017 , the web site america ’ s freedom fighters published a story that purported to directly link undocumented immigrants in san diego , california to a local hepatitis a outbreak : <PARA> it also closed on a more explicitly anti - immigrant note : <PARA> san diego county officials did declare a local health emergency on 31 august 2017 in response to a hepatitis outbreak , but there is no indication whatsoever that it originated or was spread by the city ’ s local undocumented population . a spokesperson for the county ’ s health and human services department , craig sturak , told us : <PARA> sturak confirmed to us that 15 people had died in connection to the outbreak as of 29 august 2017 . however , he also said that 263 people — not 400 — had been hospitalized out of 378 cases . san diego city council member chris ward , whose district includes the downtown area ( which has a high concentration of the local homeless population ), told us in a statement : <PARA> fellow council member david alvarez , who has sparred with mayor kevin faulconer regarding the city response to the issue , told us : <PARA> the disease is a liver infection that , according to the centers for disease control , is “ usually transmitted by the fecal - oral route , either through person - to - person contact or consumption of contaminated food or water .” <PARA> following the emergency declaration by public health officer wilma wooten , the city began installing hand - washing stations in at least thirty locations around the city , including more than a dozen downtown . street - cleaning crews will also be directed to remove “ all feces , blood , bodily fluids or contaminated surfaces ” with a mix of high - pressure water and bleach . <PARA> the outbreak was traced back to november 2016 , but according to wooten , vaccination efforts and distribution of hygiene kits did not quell the spread of the infection . experts reportedly did not gauge the speed of the outbreak until march 2017 . <PARA> alvarez has called for faulconer to declare a homeless state of emergency , saying that it would allow the city to bypass some regulations in order to designate some buildings as temporary housing . an advisor for faulconer , jonathan herrera , countered by saying that faulconer had already done so in 2016 and 2017 . <PARA> on 30 august 2017 , the california state assembly ’ s joint committee on legislative audit approved a request by state sen . ben hueso ( d ) to investigate whether the county has employed enough public nurses to deal with the outbreak . <PARA> we have reached out to the san diego regional task force on the homeless seeking comment . the group reported in april 2017 that there were 9 , 116 people locally as “ living in the streets or in shelters ,” up 5 percent compared to 2016 . alvarez told us that the task force did not ask for individuals ’ immigration status while compiling its data .
true	the seagull waits until the shopkeeper isn ’ t looking , and then walks into the store and grabs a snack - size bag of cheese doritos . <PARA> once outside , the bag gets ripped open and shared by other birds . <PARA> the seagull ’ s shoplifting started early this month when he first swooped into the store in aberdeen , scotland , <PARA> and helped himself to a bag of chips . since then , he ’ s become a regular . he always takes the same type of chips . <PARA> customers have begun paying for the seagull ’ s stolen bags of chips because they think it ’ s so funny . <PARA> origins : seagulls are regarded as nuisances by many people ( especially in urban coastal areas ) not only because of their tendency to drop large globs of avian doo - doo on unsuspecting pedestrians , but also <PARA> because they are aggressive , opportunistic scavengers . these birds are not just resourceful , they are also patient : once a seagull has identified a potential food source , it may stand still with its eyes locked on the prize , waiting as long as necessary for just the right opening to dash in , snatch some edibles , and escape safely — much to the consternation of many an outdoor diner . <PARA> in july 2007 , a seagull in aberdeen , scotland , made the news for a rather unusual manifestation of sneaky scavenging behavior . the bird , named “ sam ” by the locals , developed the habit ( as shown above ) of strolling through an open door into the rs mccoll newsagents shop there , snatching bags of cheese - flavored doritos from a rack just inside the entryway , and dashing away . <PARA> according to store personnel , sam always birdlifted the same flavor of doritos ( perhaps due to the color of the packaging ), carrying the bags outside the store , where he ripped them open and ( along with other birds ) devoured their contents . <PARA> the bbc reported shop assistant sriaram nagarajan as saying of sam : <PARA> at first i didn ’ t believe a seagull was capable of stealing crisps . but i saw it with my own eyes and i was surprised . he ’ s very good at it . <PARA> he ’ s becoming a bit of a celebrity . seagulls are usually not that popular but sam is a star because he ’ s so funny . <PARA> a spokesman for royal society for the protection of birds ( rspb ) also noted of sam : <PARA> perhaps it tried some crisps in a shiny packet in the street , and was just opportunistic one day at the shop when it saw what was inside . <PARA> as everyone knows , gulls can be very quick and fearless , and clearly this one is no exception . <PARA> we ’ d discourage people from feeding gulls though , as gulls in towns generate lots of complaints every year , and the availability of food is the only reason they live in urban settings . <PARA> here ’ s another videoclip of sneaky sam in action :

unproven	on 4 june 2017 , facebook user tianna stipp shared a post cautioning others about an incident she purportedly experienced at the coon rapids walmart in minnesota : <PARA> stipp ’ s post was one of countless similar warnings in which a shopper , typically female , believes that she narrowly escaped the grasp of human traffickers in the course of an interaction with fellow shoppers in a retail environment . <PARA> although the questions were perhaps bothersome and unwanted , nothing in particular set off alarm bells on first glance . according to stipp , the man she encountered became increasingly engaged as she attempted to extricate herself from the conversation . stipp speculated that her discomfort caused her child to become visibly fussy — at which point the man reportedly asked her if he could hold and comfort the boy : <PARA> stipp added that she summoned a walmart greeter , and then fled the store . on advice she later received from family members , stipp said she called the police to report the encounter : <PARA> although the story ’ s subtext was somewhat dependent on the interpretation of the reader , it sounded most of all as though an overbearing shopper made a fellow customer feel uncomfortable . stipp made it clear that she felt differently : <PARA> stipp claimed that the police told her that she “ did it right ” and “ did everything she could ,” hinting that authorities were in agreement with stipp ’ s interpretation of events as a ruse to abduct children . <PARA> many of the comments on stipp ’ s thread came from readers who were also convinced the incident was related to trafficking ( although they disagreed on whether the mother or child was the intended victim ), recounted instances in which the “ same thing ” happened to them , encouraged stipp to carry a gun or conceal her identity , and repeatedly claimed that similar interactions are becoming exceedingly common . one of the recurring themes amid hundreds of comments was absolute , unshakeable conviction that stipp narrowly avoided being targeted , and that abductions of that nature were on a measurable upswing : <PARA> although the report notes that a walmart associate suggested stipp was possibly followed out to her car , the department did not appear to believe the incident was related to human trafficking . the department did look for the individual , but noted that he might very well have been going about his business unaware that stipp was so unsettled by the encounter : <PARA> as stipp and hundreds of commenters demonstrated , the belief that walmarts , targets , krogers , and ikeas are teeming with accented men swarming with the intent to whisk women and children away is as pervasive as it is old . dozens of nearly identical facebook posts recount similarly vague ( but shared as harrowing ) accounts of purported attempted abductions in target , walmart , mall parking lots , or other family - friendly retail outlets . rumors of this sort became fashionable on facebook in or around may 2015 , when a woman shared a story , later debunked , about an oklahoma hobby lobby store encounter . <PARA> the following month , twitter was overrun with rumors of a sex slavery ring targeting college kids at summer job interviews ; later that same month a long - circulating urban legend about a theme park abduction appeared and made the rounds again . subsequent stories included a frightening ( but false ) claim about purported teenaged abductors ( armed with heroin - filled syringes to drug putative victims ) at a denton , texas , dillards , a story from a woman convinced she was a near - victim of human traffickers with gift bags in the parking lot of a hickory , north carolina , walmart store , and a constellation of rumors claiming target stores in tampa , longview ( texas ), and houston were populated by a legion of sex trafficking scouts . <PARA> not long after a similar claim on facebook went viral , “ free range kids ” author and parenting advocate lenore skenazy wrote about the skyrocketing popularity of social media abduction horror stories : <PARA> skenazy notes that the tales themselves fueled the belief that trafficking is happening everywhere , but that is completely incongruent with known patterns of abduction or trafficking : <PARA> we contacted stipp via facebook to ask about the coon rapids walmart incident , but have not yet received a response .

false	origins : during a 2004 sojourn in las vegas , i had the unspeakable good fortune to be dealt a royal flush on a video poker machine , an event the math gurus say will happen only once every <PARA> 649 , 739 deals . ( to better explain how unusual an occurrence that is , the odds of arriving at a royal flush even after a five - card deal and appropriate redraw are about 1 in 40 , 000 . [ 1 in 42 , 000 if you favor a deuces wild machine ]. dealt royals are the stuff of daydreams , not of reality .) <PARA> my shock at this unexpectedly fortuitous turn of events did not , however , keep me from noticing a behavior of the machine that served to cast doubt upon a story i ’ d heard in 2000 , a tale i now believe to be an urban legend . <PARA> although there are various forms of video poker available to the gaming enthusiast , the holy grail on each of these games is the elusive royal flush , that peculiarly beautiful combination of the ten , jack , queen , king , and ace of the same suit . except on certain unusual specialist machines , its appearance generates the highest payout on the game , typically 4 , 000 units of the game ’ s denomination if full - coin have been played . in easier - to - understand terms , on a 25 ¢ video poker machine , provided the maximum bet of 5 coins had been made ($ 1 . 25 ), the royal flush results in a jackpot of $ 1 , 000 for the lucky winner . the cards need not be in sequence to generate the prize ; they can appear on the screen in utter disarray and still be worth the 4 , 000 - coin payout . ( some specialist machines grant an additional prize for the cards appearing in a certain order , but even on them disordered royals still pay the usual amount .) <PARA> in a typical game of video poker , after the bet is made , pressing the ‘ deal ’ button results in the appearance of the video representations of five playing cards on the game ’ s screen . the player decides which “ cards ” to keep and which to throw away in hopes of improving his hand by way of pressing the appropriate ‘ hold ’ buttons located beneath the five images . he presses ‘ deal ’ again , with the machine replacing the unheld cards with new ones . the player is now paid for any winning combinations found in these final five representations . <PARA> so much for the mechanics of the game , now for the story . <PARA> according to the tale of woe i heard from a blackjack dealer in 2000 , one fellow of a friend ’ s acquaintance had recently had a royal flush dealt to him on a video poker machine at a convenience store . ( these games can be found in many small businesses in las vegas ; they are <PARA> not limited to just the casinos .) this hapless , foolish lad had , in his excitement upon seeing the suited beauties land on the screen , failed to press ‘ hold ’ under each of the five cards before hitting the ‘ deal ’ button , thereby discarding all of the winning cards . because this took place at a convenience store , a slot technician was not on hand to open the machine and verify the game ’ s memory , so the win could not be substantiated . the man who had seconds before been favored by one of dame fortune ’ s rarest smiles now had only his memory of the royal to keep him warm , not the $ 1 , 000 that should have come with it . <PARA> previously , i had not had occasion to doubt the story about the guy who ’ d pitched his royal . i ’ ve spent enough time in and around casinos to no longer be amazed by what folks will do while gambling . however , how my machine behaved upon dealing its royal flush to me called this tale into question — mine had immediately marked all five cards as held , declared the hand to be over , set the “ summon attendant ” light atop the machine to flashing , and started playing the happy music that signals a royal ’ s having been hit . i had not so much as been offered the chance to hold all the cards ; the machine had done it for me . it had subsequently performed the mechanized equivalent of pressing the ‘ deal ’ button on my behalf , thereby ending the hand on the dealt royal and making it impossible for me to unhold any of the cards . <PARA> if video poker machines always behave that way upon dealing royal flushes , the story i ’ d heard could not be anything but a fairy tale because the ill - starred man would never have been in position to undo his winning result . but was it possible this “ hold all the cards and lock the machine ” behavior was new to the game ? for an answer to this , i turned to international game technology , the world leader in slot machine and video gaming machine design and production . igt knows video poker in that it created and marketed the first such machines in the 1970s . moreover , to this day it continues to command the lion ’ s share of the vp market . <PARA> according to the poker gurus at igt , the origins of the “ hold everything on the dealt royal ” function are lost in the mists of history . this feature has been a part of igt machines for so long that they ’ ve forgotten when it was added , which leaves open the possibility that it has always been there . igt incorporates this feature into its slot offerings as well , which means megabucks winners and the like are never at risk of inadvertently playing off their big wins before casino personnel can verify that these jackpots have been hit . <PARA> granted , not every video poker machine is made by igt , and other manufacturers may not incorporate the “ hold everything on the big win ” feature in their products . for that reason , the story of the pitched royal cannot be utterly ruled out . <PARA> yet whatever remote possibility of veracity still remains , the story should be viewed as a cautionary tale that admonishes folks ( video poker players and non - gamblers alike ) to always exercise due care . the apocryphal fellow who pitched his royal and by so doing lost his $ 1 , 000 prize had acted in haste — had he taken his time , he ’ d have left that store with the grand in his pocket . we are expected to draw a lesson from that man ’ s plight and apply it to our own lives , to use his unhappy experience to forestall similar outcomes in our own . <PARA> barbara “ grand disappointment ” mikkelson

false	just as most any anonymous piece of cynically humorous satire about american politics and culture ends up eventually being attributed to comedian george carlin , so the same kind of material gets credited to english comic john cleese when it evinces a british viewpoint on american affairs . unlike his fellow monty python trouper terry jones , however , mr . cleese doesn ’ t generally pen this sort of political levity . <PARA> the genesis of this article is a long and convoluted one . it hit the online world shortly after the contentious u . s . presidential election of 2000 , in which the results of florida ’ s crucial vote were disputed for weeks , the u . s . supreme court eventually stepped in to halt recounts , and george w . bush was declared the winner despite receiving fewer popular votes overall than his opponent , al gore . <PARA> the piece evidently originated on with one alan baxter of rochester , u . k ., who wrote and posted a much shorter , four - item version to an internal newsgroup hosted by his employer in november 2000 , as a wry commentary on the recently concluded ( but then still far from decided ) u . s . presidential election : <PARA> this item was soon reworked and expanded into a ten - point version : <PARA> the “ revocation ” piece escaped into the wider world of the internet a week later when peter rieden of farnborough , u . k ., added three more entries to a slightly revised the list ( bringing the total to thirteen ) and posted it to the usenet newsgroup sci . military . naval on 15 november 2000 : <PARA> the “ revocation of independence ” quickly spread far and wide on the internet through e - mail forwards , newsgroup posts , and mailing lists , and within days newspapers in the u . k . were running even longer , fifteen - point versions , such as the following : <PARA> curiously , u . s . newspapers tended to run a fifteen - point version as well , but one that was much terser and made significantly different “ demands ” to which the u . s . was required to comply : <PARA> predictably , the satire spawned a variety of u . s . “ rebuttal ” versions : <PARA> another popular response to the “ revocation ” piece was this one : <PARA> all of this brought us to the end of 2004 , when the u . s . went through another controversial presidential election ( although one not nearly as close or contested as the 2000 version ), which once again resulted in a victory for the republican candidate , george w . bush . one of the multiplicity of variants of the four - year - old “ revocation of independence ” satire was dusted off , british funnyman john cleese ’ s name was appended to the end , and the cycle of forwarding started all over again , only this time with a recognizable name attached to the piece . many , many people have had a hand in shaping the multiple variations of this bit of humor that now exist , but john cleese himself is one of the few who hasn ’ t .

true	virus : heartbleed <PARA> origins : in april 2014 came the announcement that a bug in software used by millions of web servers may have exposed many web sites ’ users to spying and eavesdropping , including the interception of their passwords and other account information the bug , dubbed “ heartbleed ,” resides in a software library called openssl that is used in servers , operating systems , email , and instant messaging systems . ironically , this software is supposed to protect sensitive data as it travels back and forth . <PARA> “ heartbleed ” allows hackers to easily trick servers running openssl into revealing decryption keys stored on their memory . with those keys , the ill - intentioned can eavesdrop on encrypted communications , directly steal sensitive information , and impersonate users and services . <PARA> openssl is employed in the widely used apache and nginx server software . <PARA> statistics from net monitoring firm netcraft suggest that about 500 , 000 of the web ’ s secure servers are running versions of the vulnerable software . ( the bug gained its “ heartbleed ” moniker due to its occurring in the heartbeat extension for openssl .) <PARA> the bug was discovered by researchers working for google and security firm codenomicon . in a blog entry about their findings , the researchers said the “ serious vulnerability ” allowed anyone to read chunks of memory in servers running the flawed version of openssl . via this route , attackers could get at the secret keys used to scramble data as it passes between a server and its users . <PARA> the bug has been present in versions of openssl that have been available for over two years . the latest version of openssl released on 7 april 2014 is no longer vulnerable to the bug . however , protecting a server from this vulnerability may not be merely a matter of installing the updated version of openssl : if attackers had exploited the weakness at an earlier date , they could have already stolen the encryption keys , passwords , or other credentials required to access accounts on that server . <PARA> full protection might require web site operators ’ updating to the safer version of openssl as well as getting new security certificates and generating new encryption keys . to help operators check their systems , security researchers have produced tools that will determine if servers are running vulnerable versions of openssl . <PARA> unfortunately , as security experts have noted , there is not much that individual internet users can do to protect themselves against the heartbleed vulnerability , as resolution of the issue depends upon the operators of web sites making changes to their systems : <PARA> security experts warn there is little internet users can do to protect themselves from the recently uncovered “ heartbleed ” bug that exposes data to hackers , at least not until exploitable websites upgrade their software . <PARA> “ there is nothing users can do to fix their computers ,” said mikko hypponen , chief research officer with security software maker f - secure . <PARA> hypponen said computer users could immediately change passwords on accounts , but they would have to do so again if their operators notify them that they are vulnerable . <PARA> “ take care of the passwords that are very important to you ,” he said . “ maybe change them now , maybe change them in a week . and if you are worried about your credit cards , check your credit card bills very closely .” <PARA> bruce schneier , a well - known cryptologist and chief technology officer of co3 systems , called on internet firms to issue new certificates and keys for encrypting internet traffic , which would render stolen keys useless . <PARA> that will be time - consuming , said barrett lyon , chief technology officer of cybersecurity firm defense . net inc . “ there ’ s going to be lots of chaotic mess ,” he said . <PARA> mark maxey , a director with cybersecurity firm accuvant , said it is no easy task for large organizations to implement the multiple steps to clean up the bug , which means it will take some a long time to do so . <PARA> “ there is nothing users can do to fix their computers ,” said mikko hypponen , chief research officer with security software maker f - secure . <PARA> hypponen said computer users could immediately change passwords on accounts , but they would have to do so again if their operators notify them that they are vulnerable . <PARA> “ take care of the passwords that are very important to you ,” he said . “ maybe change them now , maybe change them in a week . and if you are worried about your credit cards , check your credit card bills very closely .” <PARA> bruce schneier , a well - known cryptologist and chief technology officer of co3 systems , called on internet firms to issue new certificates and keys for encrypting internet traffic , which would render stolen keys useless . <PARA> that will be time - consuming , said barrett lyon , chief technology officer of cybersecurity firm defense . net inc . “ there ’ s going to be lots of chaotic mess ,” he said . <PARA> mark maxey , a director with cybersecurity firm accuvant , said it is no easy task for large organizations to implement the multiple steps to clean up the bug , which means it will take some a long time to do so . <PARA> additional information :

unproven	anecdotal stories abound about the dangers of burning scented candles in an enclosed space . the information is difficult to track down , muddied by vague claims about “ toxins ” and what seems to be conflicting information : some studies indicate that scented candles cause cancer , others conclude they don ’ t . yet another study concludes that it ’ s what the candle is made of , as opposed to the scent itself , that can be harmful . <PARA> there doesn ’ t seem to be an agency in the united states that has jurisdiction to oversee whether scented candles present a health risk or not . the food and drug administration ( fda ), environmental protection agency ( epa ), national cancer institute ( nci ) and consumer product safety committee either said they do not have jurisdiction over scented candles , or referred us to one of the other agencies upon inquiry . the national candle association ( nca ), meanwhile , wrote to us on 23 august 2016 and said candles are safe . <PARA> one study done by researchers from the united states and europe concluded that under “ normal conditions ,” scented candles do not present a health risk . another study by a researcher at south carolina state university concluded that burning candles made of paraffin can result in health problems , including cancer and asthma . still another indicated that candles ( and incense ) can contain everything from particulate contaminants that can affect air quality to lead , which is put into wicks to make them stand straight and can still be found in scented - candle circles despite a voluntary ban . <PARA> per the nca : <PARA> what to believe ? in january , british publication the telegraph reported that a study completed by professor alastair lewis of the national centre for atmospheric science at the university of york found the ingredient limonene — which gives products a citrus smell — could be carcinogenic . professor lewis told the publication : <PARA> limonene reportedly mutates into formaldehyde upon contact with air . according to the nci , formaldehyde is a carcinogen : <PARA> the evidence does indicate that there are dangers associated with pollutants that result from burning candles ( and incense ), although how much damage can be caused ( and by which candles ) is still up in the air . moderation is probably the best approach , as is keeping areas well - ventilated and not leaving candles unattended . while research noted above does seem to indicate that vegetable - based candles , like soy , are healthier , the nca also weighed in to say that all candles burn the same and there are no more health risks associated with parafin than there are soy candles . finally it ’ s a good idea to avoid the ingredient limonene , no matter how good it might smell , in any cleaning or fragrance product .

mixture	mixture <PARA> origins : on 9 july 2015 fox news published an article titled “ oregon allowing 15 - year - olds to get state - subsidized sex - change operations ,” ( accompanied by several broadcast segments ) claiming that a recently approved policy in the state enables minors as young as 15 to undergo gender reassignment surgery without the knowledge or consent of their parents . <PARA> the article ( subsequently aggregated to a number of web sites without additional investigation ) stated : <PARA> a portland transgender advocate addressed the claims made in the article , indicating that the assertions were implausible with respect to the mechanics of gender reassignment surgery : <PARA> the oregon health authority also released a statement about the such claims , explaining that the age of medical consent in oregon ( 15 ) and coverage of gender dysphoria as a medical condition in no way suggested that teens of that age were in actuality undergoing surgery without the knowledge or consent of their parents : <PARA> the documents to which fox news referred ( which purportedly “ quietly ” approved gender reassignment for teens ) in actuality assessed aligning oregon ’ s public health coverage ( for patients of all ages ) with the general standard of treatment for gender dysphoria . surgery was listed as one of several options available to patients under later revised guidelines and was not specific to minors : <PARA> the only portion of the documents in question pertaining to minors did not mention parental consent and simply referenced “ medications to suppress puberty in gender questioning youth .” in terms of utilization estimates in the june 2014 document , oregon ’ s health evidence review commission stated that 175 total oregonians ( not specifically or even primarily teens ) would likely be covered under the inclusion each year : <PARA> the numbers provided are not insignificant with respect to an estimated number of surgeries performed each year . a 2015 washington post article quoted two medical experts who estimated that “ a woman who chooses the full range of surgical procedures available would spend $ 75 , 000 or more to transition to a male ,” but surgically transitioning “ from male to female might cost in the $ 40 , 000 to $ 50 , 000 range .” so even factoring in the lowest cited cost of $ 40 , 000 per individual surgery ( and the fact that the estimates included all medicaid patients in oregon treated for gender dysphoria , not just minors ), the “ less than $ 150 , 000 per year ” estimated spending would cover just three patients — with hardly anything left over for non - surgical treatments such as counseling and medication . <PARA> the fox article also cited a 2008 study that stated “ most children with gender dysphoria will not remain gender dysphoric after puberty ,” implicitly suggesting that children in oregon who might opt for gender reassignment surgery ( without any input from their parents regarding the serious health decision ) would invariably come to regret their hasty course of action later in life . however , fox elided the portion of the study that indicated the children presenting as gender dysphoric had an “ age range [ of ] 5 - 12 years ,” meaning all study participants were well under the threshold age of medical consent in oregon . that omission was in contrast to the wording of fox ’ s headline , which specifically cited minors aged 15 and over ( none of which were included in the cited study ). <PARA> it ’ s true that the age of medical consent in oregon is 15 ( whether or not a minor is transgender ), and in early 2015 the state of oregon ’ s herc did opt to include gender dysphoria in a list of conditions covered by the state ’ s medicaid plans . but publicized claims misled readers and viewers into thinking that a new guideline had approved “ sex changes ” for teenagers by conflating extant oregon state policies that were largely unrelated . <PARA> in fact , the age of medical consent in oregon has been 15 since 1971 , and gender dysphoria medicaid coverage changes applied to all residents of the state ( not teens specifically ). the fox article ( and subsequent iterations ) failed to consider the lengthy , arduous process gender reassignment entails or the likelihood that any medical provider would agree to begin such a process on a minor who lacked parental consent . moreover , the policy change was not enacted “ quietly ” ( i . e ., without notice or disclosure ), as the associated press had published an article announcing “ oregon medicaid to cover gender reassignment ” nearly a year earlier . <PARA> we ’ ve asked out herc whether additional details are available to determine whether any 15 - to 17 - year - olds have been affected by the policy update or have undergone gender reassignment in oregon following the change . <PARA> originally published : 10 july 2015

unproven	<URL> <PARA> this is a new product designed to be a more effective product than other flea / tick treatments that was just released this year . it is available thru a vet and not currently on - line . i got promeris this week for my 7 dogs ( 6 huskies & 1 golden - airedale ), and the results were debilitating for nearly all of them - including me . since my incident this week , my vet has pulled it from distribution and alerted the manufacturer , fort dodge . <PARA> here are my results : within less than 2 hours after applying , 4 of my dogs had vomited from 2 - 4 times , 3 were disoriented and stumbling , 1 was dragging his back leg , 1 was salivating . i had very similar symptoms like an allergic reaction - my lips were swollen , eyes very red , mucous membranes such as eyes , nose , and mouth were stinging . i was very disoriented - dizzy equilibrium and not able to drive . to make this a short story - all 7 of my dogs were admitted to the hospital for veterinarian care , and 3 of them remained for care , iv fluids and observation for 24 hours . i was in the emergency room . i ’ m home now and so are the dogs . we ’ re all feeling much better . vet bills were over $ 2 , 500 and fort dodge is paying for these . not only can the product cause this reaction , it has a highly noxious odor that permeated the house and is just starting to dissipate after 3 days . <PARA> your dogs / cats might not have the same reaction , but given my experience — i wanted to help you all become well - educated about the <PARA> product . <PARA> origins : promeris , produced by fort dodge animal health ( a division of wyeth ), is a topical pet product used for controlling and preventing flea and tick infestations in cats and dogs . promeris , whose active ingredients are metaflumizone ( for flea control ) and amitraz ( for tick control ), was approved by the environmental protection agency ( epa ) in mid - 2007 . promeris is only available through practicing veterinarians and is not sold as an over - the - counter product . <PARA> since the introduction of promeris , anecdotal accounts ( like the one quoted above ) have appeared stating that pets ( and in some cases their owners ) <PARA> have experienced severe adverse symptoms such as lethargy , vomiting , diarrhea , disorientation , depression , nervous twitching , and hyper salivation after the application of promeris . ( similar accounts can be found here .) <PARA> it is difficult to determine at this time whether such anecdotal reports indicate a serious general problem with promeris . just about any product used with animals , no matter how generally safe , can produce adverse reactions in some cases due to misuse ( i . e ., misapplication or overdose ) or unusual sensitivity to one or more ingredients in individual animals . moreover , the safety studies conducted for promeris found no significant problems with either cats or dogs , even when the animals were given repeated topical applications of five times the recommended dosage . the studies suggest that most of the symptoms described in accounts such as the one quoted above are likely reactions stemming from treated animals ’ ingesting the product after application . ( promeris , like many such products , is deliberately formulated to be unpalatable in order to prevent such accidental ingestion .) <PARA> promeris is aware of these reports , and their representative veterinarian , dr . tom linz , said “ a group of veterinarians in the company handle these adverse events when people call in and we investigate them thoroughly to make sure it is the product and it ’ s not a concurrent product or something else going on .”

false	examples : <PARA> on january 15 , 2013 a law enforcement officer in the north end of the greater houston area stopped a semi tractor - trailer driver , who was heading in a southerly direction , during a routine check for drugs . during a search of the cargo of the trailer , he discovered packages of road signs that read the following : “ martial law in effect ”. the driver had a bill of lading in his possession stating that this cargo ’ s destination was to the department of homeland security . <PARA> [ collected via e - mail , 1999 ] <PARA> i met a man last night that used to go to my church . brandon moved last year before i started attending . but several people , including the pastor , say that brandon is totally honest and does not “ go off half - cocked .” <PARA> brandon told me that his wife received a call from her cousin last week . the cousin lives in ohio and her husband is a truck driver for wal - mart . it seems he was driving a load early last week and stopped at a border weigh station . the inspector wanted to know what was in the load , and the driver indicated he did not know . he merely picked up the trailer and was transporting it to another state . <PARA> the inspector opened the trailer and saw hundreds of uniform boxes . he asked what was in the boxes and the driver again stated that he didn ’ t know . so the inspector opened a box . <PARA> in the box were about a hundred large ( about 2 ’ x3 ′) plastic signs that stated : “ this city under martial law ” in bright colors . it said something about the federal gov ’ t and had what looked like a legal reference ( the driver claims to know nothing about legal issues , but he thought it was a reference to a law or an executive order or something ). <PARA> there were several hundred boxes of these signs . the driver doesn ’ t know what wal - mart has to do with the signs . but he did state that wal - mart sometimes hires out space on their trucks if space is available . i might suggest that maybe the federal gov ’ t was using wal - mart trucks to keep a low profile . <PARA> anyway , the info came to me by way of a long route . but the sources are “ innocent bystanders ” with no history of right - wing reactionary politics . the driver was married to a woman who was related to brandon ’ s wife . brandon swears the info is accurate and that he spoke with the driver himself to confirm what was passed between the respective wives . the driver claims there were hundreds of boxes , each one with at least a hundred large signs declaring martial law . <PARA> i thought this was worth passing along . especially since the federal gov ’ t is telling us ( wednesday issue of usa today and today ’ s press releases ) that we have nothing to fear . <PARA> [ collected via e - mail , 1999 ] <PARA> becky , my wife , went to her long - time doctor today . the conversation shifted to current events . this very credible doctor told her his brother - in - law followed a truck part of the way home from beaumont . the truck was loaded with signs covered , individually , with cardboard . <PARA> the truck stopped at a stop sign , and the bro - in - law , could read a label on the boxes which said “ martial law signs ”. this was on saturday march 27 1999 . <PARA> again , this was from a medical doctor who is very credible . this is not just hearsay or rumor from folks we dont know . you might want to pass this on , and keep your powder dry ! <PARA> [ collected via e -

loaded is what sends up a red - flag . <PARA> they were unloading road signs . some of the road signs read the following “ martial law – road closed ”. all the signs had something to do with martial law . <PARA> origins : one of the most commonly and continuously circulated types of conspiracy theories has to do with claims that the president of the united states or some other federal agency is about to declare martial law . rumors about the imposition of martial law circulate particularly widely after the occurrence of large - scale catastrophes ( such as the 9 / 11 attacks ) or in anticipation of troubling times to come ( such as the election of a new president , the arrival of the year 2000 , or the passage of more stringent gun control laws ). such rumors generally feature a plot in which the government ’ s plan to impose martial law has been inadvertently revealed through some minor accidental or coincidental incident , typically the discovery of a truck carrying a cargo of road signs which bear wording indicating that martial law is in effect . <PARA> while the imposition of martial law during times of national emergency is always a distinct yet distant possibility , nothing about the process mandates that signs proclaiming “... by order of martial law ” be erected . a state of martial law is simply declared by the president , after which troops and / or national guardsmen are deployed to enforce it . as such , if roads need to be closed , standard “ road closed ” signs are erected . it ’ s not the presence or absence of a sign that ’ s important ; it ’ s the authority of the armed guy manning the barricade that matters . <PARA> the more rational among us realize that even if the government had a contingency plan up its sleeve to suspend civil liberties , <PARA> not even washington bureaucrats would think special road signs needed to be printed up ahead of time to make all this legal . again , nothing about martial law requires the erection of specific signs to make it so — martial law exists from the moment an authorized government official says it does . and as for the notion that special signs would be needed to communicate this state of affairs to the civilian populace , notices transmitted by television , radio , and the internet would accomplish this purpose just fine . <PARA> if roads needed to be closed , ordinary signs announcing such a closure would serve that purpose . manufacturing special ones would inevitably lead to the government ’ s secret plans being found out , as leaks would soon reach the press from those who produced or transported the signs . better to stockpile a zillion standard “ road closed ” signs than to risk inadvertently announcing what many americans would see as an unwarranted armed takeover . <PARA> okay , so if the signs are a ridiculous flourish in this form of rumor , why are they part of the story ? <PARA> it all comes down to plot device . the signs , you see , are the means by which the government ’ s evil plan is revealed to the unsuspecting citizenry . if a truck full of “ road closed ” signs spilled its contents , not even the most charismatic rumormonger would be able to convince anyone this was all tied to a federal plot to take over the country . but make them “ by order of martial law ” signs , and the story now has legs to run on . <PARA> ( revelation by way of written communication turns up in urban legends whenever a device is needed to propel the story forward by way of explaining actions that have taken place . a fine example of this serves as the lynchpin for the dishonest note tale , wherein the miscreant gives away his ruse in the note he pens ; in real life he ’ d either simply scribble something innocuous or just leave a blank piece of paper behind .) <PARA> conspiracy rumors like this one play upon fears that the government has too much power and will use it against its citizens given any opportunity to do so . versions of the rumor that bring walmart into the picture as a partner in the impending takeover ( by contracting to carry such signs in their trucks ) further establish the basis for this rumor as one of fear of the all - powerful : like the government , walmart is viewed by many as a predatory entity too big to control with the ability to be a law unto itself . <PARA> only once in u . s . history has a president declared martial law on a national basis , and that occurrence took place during the civil war , when abraham lincoln suspended habeas corpus for “ prisoners of war , spies , or aiders and abettors of the enemy ” throughout the united states . outside of wartime , all other instances of martial law in the u . s . have been imposed on a local basis by governors or mayors .
false	in the spring of 2019 , the christian conservative website freedom project prompted concern among some readers by reporting that a public school district in california was “ teaching pedophilia ” as a sexual orientation . <PARA> on 17 april , the site published an article with the headline “ pedophilia being taught as ‘ sexual orientation ’ in california schools .” the article continued : <PARA> the report centered around a short clip showing an exchange between yates and torres , which can be viewed below : <PARA> that clip was taken from a longer video , posted to the “ informed parents of california ” facebook group . the 43 - minute video was recorded on 21 march at a public information evening for parents in the brea , california , school district , on the subject of the healthy youth act . the full video can be watched here . <PARA> california lawmakers passed the healthy youth act , as we have outlined previously , in 2015 , creating a new k - 12 , sex - education curriculum that remained in place as of april 2019 . <PARA> the law requires school districts across california to implement instruction for students related to reproductive health , sex education , personal safety , prevention of hiv and other sexually transmitted infections , child and adolescent growth , as well as programming on relationships , families , gender identity and sexual orientation . <PARA> each school district must devise its own curriculum , including specific reading materials and classroom presentations , provided the content is in keeping with the requirements of the healthy youth act , including the requirement that all instructional material must be “ age - appropriate .” <PARA> on the subject of sexual orientation , the text of the legislation states : “ instruction and materials shall affirmatively recognize that people have different sexual orientations and , when discussing or providing examples of relationships and couples , shall be inclusive of same - sex relationships .” the legislation does not mention pedophilia ( sexual activity between an adult and child ) or pederasty ( sexual activity between a man and a boy ). <PARA> the full 43 - minute video shows a 21 march presentation given by brea olinda unified school district ( bousd ) assistant superintendent kerrie torres , which provided attending parents with information about how the district was implementing the requirements of the healthy youth act , and what the bousd curriculum entailed . <PARA> around 25 minutes into the video , yates interrupted torres ’ presentation to ask about the curriculum ’ s component on sexual orientation , and whether parents could withdraw their children from it ( a subject we have previously examined in greater detail ). yates said : <PARA> “... i ’ m just wondering , because you did give me this powerpoint presentation that actually goes through the history of the lgbtiq [ lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender , intersex , questioning ], that talks about the practice of pederastery [ sic ], which is pedophilia specific to boys and men . ... you said you don ’ t teach anything inappropriate , but you ’ re teaching , normalizing pederastery [ sic ].” <PARA> yates ’ interruption was cut short , but after torres ’ presentation , yates once again confronted the bousd official with claims that the curriculum was ‘ normalizing anal sex ’ and ‘ teaching pedophilia in school .’ the following exchange ensued : <PARA> yates : answer me why you ’ re teaching pedophilia in school , to ninth - graders . <PARA> torres : teaching what ? <PARA> yates : pedophilia . pederastery [ sic ]. right here . <PARA> torres : pederastery [ sic ]... this is done because we are talking about historical perspectives of how gender relations and different types of sexual orientations have existed in history . so this is something — <PARA> unidentified voice : so sex between a man and a boy is a sexual orientation ? <PARA> torres : — something that ’ s occurred in history and this is really important for us to include .” <PARA> at no point did torres state that the school district was endorsing the practice of pederasty or pedophilia , nor even that the curriculum described pederasty as a discrete sexual orientation — the core of the claim made by freedom project in its subsequent report , which falsely described torres ’ remarks as a “ stunning admission .” <PARA> in reality , yates was referring to an outdated version of the bousd healthy youth act curriculum that mentioned pederasty in a section about lgbt history , but neither endorsed the practice nor described or presented it as a discrete , legitimate sexual orientation . <PARA> bousd ’ s ninth - grade , health - education curriculum contains a component ( section 4 . 8 ) entitled “ introduction to sexual orientation ,” which includes a slideshow that teachers are intended to present to students . one of the slides relates to “ lgbtiq in history ,” and traces prominent milestones in lgbt history , including references to homosexuality in ancient rome and china . <PARA> as of april 2019 , the current version of that slide did not contain any reference to pederasty . however , an earlier version contained the following bullet point : <PARA> “ the practice of pederasty ( an older upper class man would make a young free boy his partner and become his mentor ) is mentioned in homer ’ s iliad [ the ancient greek epic poem ], and is evidenced to have existed at least 4500 years ago in ancient egypt .” <PARA> in a statement , a spokesperson for the school district told us that the previous reference to pederasty was removed from section 4 . 8 of the ninth - grade , health - education curriculum in the fall of 2018 . “ after careful review of the curriculum , the district determined it [ the bullet point ] posed more questions than answers ,” the spokesperson wrote . <PARA> the description of pederasty in the original bousd presentation is accurate , and in tracing the history of same - sex relationships in various societies , it would be perfectly relevant to mention the ancient greek custom whereby older men imposed a sexual relationship on much younger males , typically teenage boys . <PARA> although modern - day observers would view such a practice as predatory , abusive and criminal , it was widely practiced and accepted in ancient greek society . as such , it would appear relevant for inclusion in a brief summary of prominent milestones and trends in lgbt history , while bearing in mind the clear distinction between same - sex relationships , as such , and child sexual abuse . yates did not make that distinction when she confronted torres for allegedly ‘ normalizing anal sex ’ and ‘ teaching pedophilia ,’ suggesting a moral equivalence existed between consensual , same - sex sexual relations and child sexual abuse . <PARA> the bousd presentation , which is outdated anyway , did not endorse pederasty or present it approvingly , nor did it describe pederasty or pedophilia as a discrete sexual orientation . <PARA> similarly , bousd official torres did not state , in her videotaped exchange with yates , that pederasty was its own sexual orientation , or that bousd endorsed or approved of pederasty or pedophilia or taught students that sexual activity between men and boys was acceptable in any way . <PARA> thus freedom project author alex newman was inaccurate in claiming , during a widely shared facebook video , that torres had said of pedophilia “ this is a sexual orientation .” in reality , she said no such thing . <PARA> in fact , after concerns were raised at an earlier public meeting on 21 march , torres added a slide to her presentation for that evening that explicitly stated “ we do not teach pedophilia .” <PARA> taking the foregoing facts into account , we issue a rating of “ false ” for the claim that brea olinda unified school district was “ teaching pedophilia as a sexual orientation .”
unproven	examples : <PARA> a scorpion , being a very poor swimmer , asked a turtle to carry him on his back across a river . “ are you <PARA> mad ?” exclaimed the turtle . “ you ’ ll sting me while i ’ m swimming and i ’ ll drown .” <PARA> “ my dear turtle ,” laughed the scorpion , “ if i were to sting you , you would drown and i would go down with you . now where is the logic in that ?” <PARA> “ you ’ re right !” cried the turtle . “ hop on !” the scorpion climbed aboard and halfway across the river gave the turtle a mighty sting . as they both sank to the bottom , the turtle resignedly said : <PARA> “ do you mind if i ask you something ? you said there ’ d be no logic in your stinging me . why did you do it ?” <PARA> “ it has nothing to do with logic ,” the drowning scorpion sadly replied . “ it ’ s just my character .” <PARA> [ collected on the internet , 2001 ] <PARA> this girl finds a snake that pleads with her to place it in her winter coat because otherwise the snake will freeze . the girl goes “ no your bite me blah blah blah ”. anyway the girl eventually puts the snake in her jacket to keep it warm and she continues on her walk . then she feels a sharp pain in her side , the snake drops out and begins to slither away . the girl say something like “ why ? i took care of you , blah blah blah ”. the snake simply replies “ you knew what i was when you found me ”. <PARA> origins : this tale isn ’ t really an urban legend in that it is never passed along as a true story ( how many talking scorpions are there , anyway ?), but it is repeated often enough as an illustrative fable that it begs to be <PARA> included in our round up of critter tales . it is very old indeed , with this tale surfacing in ancient sanskrit collections of folklore attributed to bidpai . (‘ bidpai ’ is a corruption of ‘ bidbah ’, the appellation of the chief scholar at the court of an indian prince ) first translated into english in 1570 . <PARA> the fable is told in numerous ways , with a variety of creatures swapped in and out of its cast of characters . <PARA> when told in the forms quoted above , the story ’ s moral is universal : some creatures just are what they are . it matters not how gently they are treated ; their innate nature will cause them to unleash grievous harm even upon those who have lavished loving kindness upon them . versions featuring a river crossing make an additional element of this cautionary tale mightily clear : such creatures will remain true to their blackhearted selves even when they know their actions will be their undoing as well as their victims ’. <PARA> the story uses animals to impart a caution about human behavior : some folks are wholly irredeemable , says the legend , and woe betide those who forget that some cannot be dissuaded from their evilness , no matter who undertakes the rehabilitative efforts or how they are carried out . ultimately , blame is laid at the victim ’ s feet for not accepting what he recognized and understood to be true but chose not to believe : “ you knew what i was when you found me .” the victim ’ s arrogance in thinking he will be the one exception proves fatal , and his folly serves as a warning to others not to make the same mistake . <PARA> this parable often takes another form , one in which its moral is applied to a specific ongoing international conflict : <PARA> [ reader ’ s digest , 1967 ] <PARA> a story popular in lebanon at the time of its bank crisis last fall tells of a scorpion on the bank of the nile who asked a frog to ferry him to the other side . <PARA> “ oh no ,” the frog said . you would sting me .” <PARA> “ that ’ s ridiculous ,” the scorpion replied , “ because then i would drown .” <PARA> convinced , the frog took the scorpion on his back and began to swim the river . in midstream , the scorpion ’ s lethal urge became too strong and he plunged his stinger into the frog ’ s neck . <PARA> the sinking frog groaned , “ why , why ?” <PARA> the scorpion gave his final shrug and replied , “ this is the middle east .” <PARA> a story popular in lebanon at the time of its bank crisis last fall tells of a scorpion on the bank of the nile who asked a frog to ferry him to the other side . <PARA> “ oh no ,” the frog said . you would sting me .” <PARA> “ that ’ s ridiculous ,” the scorpion replied , “ because then i would drown .” <PARA> convinced , the frog took the scorpion on his back and began to swim the river . in midstream , the scorpion ’ s lethal urge became too strong and he plunged his stinger into the frog ’ s neck . <PARA> the sinking frog groaned , “ why , why ?” <PARA> the scorpion gave his final shrug and replied , “ this is the middle east .” <PARA> here the moral has shifted from one warning the listener against believing individual leopards are capable of changing their spots to one showcasing the twin beliefs that casual violence is inevitable in the middle east , and that the enemy is wholly without scruple . a condemnation often applied to heartless boyfriends thus finds expression as a description of an entire people — arab or israeli , depending upon where one ’ s sympathies lie . <PARA> barbara “ scorpioid paranoid ” mikkelson <PARA> sightings : on the third season finale of tv ’ s star trek : voyager (“ scorpion ,” original air date 21 may 1997 ), chakotay relates this story to janeway in the hopes of convincing her to rethink her plan to temporarily ally with the borg . the story is also repeated by jody , the victim - turned - accomplice , to fergus , his ira captor , in the 1992 movie the crying game and turns up in oliver stone ’ s 1994 film natural born killers and the 1989 film skin deep .
false	the claim that “ liquor and wine are illegal in the u . s . unless they are radioactive ” stems from an excerpt that appears in multiple books authored by berkeley physicist richard muller , including “ energy for future presidents “. muller also posted the text of this claim on a quora thread “ what are some mind - blowing facts that sound like bs but are actually true ?” <PARA> here are the points muller laid out in that post : <PARA> the science in the above - stated claim is an accurate explanation for why alcohol derived from plants would be radioactive whereas synthetic alcohol derived from petroleum products would not . <PARA> what is not supported by any available evidence are the two non - scientific claims associated with this story : that synthetic alcohol is prohibited in beverages and that they federal government tests beverages for compliance based on this law . the only official policy statement that directly touches this topic is a memo , termed a “ compliance policy guide ” issued in response to a 1957 internal inquiry between the alcohol , tobacco and firearms taxation and enforcement offices : <PARA> based on this inquiry , the fda issued the following policy statement , which does not outlaw the use of synthetic alcohol ( derived from petroleum ) so long as it is labeled accordingly : <PARA> we asked the tobacco and alcohol tax bureau , the group that would currently be in charge of enforcing such a ban , if any current laws that would prohibit the use of synthetic alcohol in beverages . thomas hogue , the director of congressional and public affairs for the alcohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau , provided this response : <PARA> he added that it is up to the fda to determine what is safe , but up to the tobacco and alcohol tax bureau to prevent consumers from being misled . in that respect , he stated that while it would be legal to use synthetic alcohol , it would have to be labeled accordingly : <PARA> there is , as well , an established protocol to test a carbon - based substance for its relative fraction of petroleum versus biologically derived material , and this test , astm d6866 , is indeed based on carbon - 14 radioactivity . however , this is not a test that the tobacco and alcohol tax bureau utilizes , per hogue : <PARA> ultimately , this is a cool bit of counterintuitive science that presents a less common use for carbon - 14 analysis . however , the evidence that this scientific information is currently used by the united states federal government to prevent synthetic alcohol in beverages is lacking .
unproven	rumors about democratic presidential candidate ’ s having some kind of ( potentially debilitating ) neurological disorder have circulated ever since the then - secretary of state fainted from dehydration while suffering from a stomach virus and sustained a concussion in december 2012 . those rumors were resurrected in july 2016 when a video clip of clinton was circulated along with claims that it showed her experiencing a brief seizure and proved she was ill and unfit to hold office : <PARA> this was more than a month old when it went viral in july 2016 . nbc news posted a video of the incident taken from another angle on 10 june 2016 and explained that clinton had just been asked about the possibility of her selecting elizabeth warren as her running mate as she left a meeting with the massachusetts senator : <PARA> the occurrence depicted above was covered by several news outlets in june 2016 , with none of them reporting the candidate had experienced a “ seizure .” the hill , for instance , reported that clinton “ exaggeratedly bob ( bed ) her head ” after reporters repeated the question about warren , while the new york daily news wrote that clinton “ gave an exaggerated startled response ” to the question . <PARA> cbs reporter hannah chanpong suggested that clinton movements were simply an exaggerated reaction to her being “ startled ” when some reporters in her blind spot started suddenly barraging her with questions about her putative vice presidential choice . the fact that clinton immediately repeated her initial reaction for humorous effect supports the hypothesis that it stemmed from a conscious movement and not an involuntary seizure : <PARA> notably , rumors that clinton was captured on camera underoing a seizure didn ’ t start circulating until well over a month later , when they were presented without any evidence beyond uninformed speculation .

false	an entry posted to a wordpress blog ( since removed ) entitled “ joel osteen ministries ” in april 2013 carried the purported announcement that joel osteen , the senior pastor of lakewood church in houston , texas , had not only resigned from that post but was renouncing his christian faith : <PARA> in a shocking and surprising development , megachurch pastor joel osteen has announced he is resigning from his post and leaving the christian faith . in a statement released on his website ( <URL> which appeared stripped down and bare , he said he has been questioning the faith for a long time . “ i believe now that the bible is a fallible , flawed , highly inconsistent history book that has been altered hundreds of times . there is zero evidence the bible is the holy word of god ,” said osteen . <PARA> the link in that blog entry leads viewers to a web site that is supposedly the “ official site of pastor joel osteen ,” a site which carries his resignation announcement and reproduces a news item from cnn headlined “ pastor of mega church resigns , rejects christ .” <PARA> it ’ s all a hoax , however . the reason the “ official site of pastor joel osteen ” looks “ stripped down and bare ” is because it ’ s a fake ( note the misspelling of his surname “ osten ” in the url ), neither cnn nor any other news outlet reported on his having resigned and left christianity behind , and both the genuine web site of joel osteen ministries and the lakewood church web site continue to carry weekly messages from joel and victoria osteen and make no mention whatsoever of this startling announcement allegedly issued by pastor osteen .
false	although many scams involve the use of telephones to contact or extract information from potential victims , a few varieties of fraud target telephone service itself as a means of obtaining ill - gotten revenue from unsuspecting prey . one common variety of telephone service fraud involves obtaining information or employing trickery that allows the scammer to place long - distance calls and bill them to someone else ( as in the #- 9 - 0 scam ), and another common variety involves duping consumers into running up hefty fees on their own telephone bills ( as in the 809 area code scam ). <PARA> in december 2005 , many uk residents were targets of the latter variety of scam , one that attempted to lure them into placing calls to a premium rate number and keep them on the line for several minutes . ( premium rate or “ pay - per - call ” numbers typically generate revenue by providing information or entertainment in exchange for a per - minute fee , which is billed to the caller ’ s phone number . such services are commonly known as “ 900 numbers “ in north america and “ 090 numbers “ in the uk , although other prefixes may be used as well .) <PARA> the bait for this scam was the distribution of official - looking postcards bearing the name “ parcel delivery services ” ( pds ) to residences , each card proclaiming that a package was awaiting delivery ( usually one said to contain a digital camera ) and that the recipient needed to call pds to obtain a “ security confirmation code ” to effect delivery of the parcel . what many consumers failed to notice ( or heed ), however , was the small print on the card informing them that the phone number provided was a premium rate number with a whopping £ 1 . 50 per - minute fee . as the bbc wales x - ray consumer investigation service found when they placed a call to the pds number : <PARA> not surprisingly , investigators failed to turn up any complainants who actually received digital cameras from pds , and phonepayplus ( formerly the independent committee for the supervision of standards of telephone information , aka icstis ), the group that oversees premium rate services in the uk , removed access to the service ( which was using up to 20 different phone numbers ) on 29 december 2005 . ( pds was run through studio telecom , a service provider registered in belize , which had previously been fined and barred by phonepayplus for using misleading direct mail promotions to generate calls to their service .) <PARA> because the internet - circulated warning did not just up and go away in december 2005 once the problem was sreolved , people continued to spread the alert in e - mail , prompting phonepayplus to add an explanation to their web site in october 2007 ( and again in updated forms in october 2009 and november 2010 ): <PARA> although the specific warning e - mail reproduced at the head of this page is out of date , it represents a common form of telephone fraud that has been used in the past and will likely be used again , so the public is well advised to be aware of it . uk telephone customers who find unexpected premium rate charges on their phone bills can obtain more information by looking up the associated phone numbers via the number checking facility on the phonepayplus web site , and they can file complaints about premium rate services through phonepayplus ’ online complaint form . u . s . residents can file complaints about premium rate services through an online form available on the web site of the federal trade commission ( ftc ).

false	revelations came to light in fall 2019 that u . s . president donald trump asked ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky to investigate current democratic presidential front - runner joe biden and his son . in response , the president ’ s defenders have highlighted a may 4 , 2018 , letter signed by three democratic senators to yuriy lutsenko , the prosecutor general of ukraine ( a similar role to the u . s . attorney general ), as evidence that claims of improper behavior are misplaced . the letter was notably described by washington post columnist marc theisen as betraying a “ double standard .” <PARA> this sentiment was amplified by several media outlets , as well as a viral tweet ( retweeted by donald trump jr .) from the twitter account comfortably smug , which according to buzzfeed news is run by a “ republican political consultant and deliberate spreader of false information ”: <PARA> several reasons exist why the above tweet and associated sentiment are incorrect and misleading . at the top of that list is the fact that the letter in question did not concern a request to “ investigate trump ,” nor did it request the opening of any investigation . <PARA> instead , it requested information on why ukrainian special prosecutor serhiy horbatyuk ( who serves in a special prosecutor role charged with investigating corruption cases linked to former ukrainian president viktor yanukovich ) had been “ prohibited ” from “ issuing subpoenas for evidence or interviewing witnesses ” in four existing investigations into former trump campaign manager paul manafort . manafort , prior to joining the trump campaign , had worked as a political consultant for yanukovich and his political party . the four investigations involved money that flowed either to manafort for this consulting work or to a law firm working with manafort and others to improve yanukovich ’ s image in the west . they did not involve trump . <PARA> the three democratic senators — then - foreign affairs committee members robert menendez , dick durbin , and patrick leahy — were responding to a may 2 , 2018 , new york times report that the four manafort investigations in ukraine were specifically singled out from a docket of nearly 3 , 000 corruption cases in horbatyuk ’ s portfolio to be blocked from issuing subpoenas and interviewing witnesses . u . s . special counsel robert mueller , in his charge to investigate russian interference in the 2016 presidential election , was investigating manafort in part because of concerns that he owed substantial funds to russian oligarchs as a result of this consulting work , potentially giving them leverage over him as he ran trump ’ s campaign . the reason ukrainian officials impeded the investigation was no secret , according to the times — it was to placate the trump administration , which opposed the mueller probe : <PARA> these discussions came at a complicated time for ukraine , a country that has been fighting russian aggression and that had been in the process of securing arms from the united states . “ the decision to halt the investigations by an anti - corruption prosecutor was handed down as the trump administration was finalizing plans to sell the country sophisticated anti - tank missiles , called javelins ,” the times reported . <PARA> far from requesting an “ investigation ”, the senators requested answers to three specific questions from a specific ukrainian government official : <PARA> manafort broadly admitted to involvement in activities related to those four ukrainian probes via a september 2018 guilty plea . <PARA> even ignoring the allegedly implied quid pro quo in the trump - zelensky call , a comparison between the senators ’ request for information from the chief ukrainian law enforcement official and trump ’ s requests of zelensky is problematic . <PARA> as senators on the committee on foreign relations , which not only provides oversight for arms deals but also general oversight of america ’ s relationships with its allies , menendez , durbin , and leahy were acting within their constitutional rights and obligations as official representatives of the u . s . government with oversight responsibility over the executive branch . <PARA> conversely , in his july 25 phone call with zelensky , trump explicitly requested that the ukrainian president meet with his personal attorney , rudy giuliani — an unelected private citizen without a security clearance or oversight from anyone but trump — to initiate investigations into a disparate set of claims whose sole unifying feature is that they concern trump ’ s political rivals : the democratic national committee and the biden family . <PARA> because the letter at issue did not actually demand an investigation into trump or even compel initiation of any investigation , we rank the claim that democrats asked ukraine to “ investigate trump ” in 2018 as false .
false	in april 2016 , a quote of indeterminate age and origin attributed to john f . kennedy was circulated on social media , words in which the former president prophetically warned that someday after he was “ long gone , we would remember him ” and realize “ we should have stopped the nuclear program of israel , abolished the federal reserve and kicked all secret societies , occultists , usurpers and zionists out of our wonderful country ”: <PARA> ( the quote wasn ’ t new to april 2016 , as readers had asked us about it as far back as march 2012 .) <PARA> president john f . kennedy , who was assassinated in 1963 , remains a revered figure to many with whom these words would resonate ; but the notion of such an aptly appealing , contemporary commentary ’ s having been lost to the annals of history is a hard sell with respect to plausibility . kennedy ’ s words have been cataloged and studied by countless historians and academics ; such a seemingly - prophetic quote about israel , the federal reserve , “ zionists ,” and other issues still relevant half a century after his death would surely have piqued the interest of historians and history aficionados long before now . yet there appears to be no record of anyone ’ s having attributed this statement to jfk until around 2012 or so . <PARA> the predictive nature of the quote is another telling aspect of its unlikelihood . john f . kennedy was shot and killed in dallas on 22 november 1963 ; and the manner in which he died was sudden , violent , and unexpected . a old man near the end of his life or a younger man slowly dying of an untreatable disease might issue a maudlin “ when i ’ m gone ” statement ; but the youngest u . s . president ever elected , who was still in the white house when he died , wasn ’ t a prime candidate for making eerie “ one day when i ’ m gone ” prophecies . <PARA> we contacted the john f . kennedy presidential library and museum in boston for verification , and a helpful archivist there pointed out several other factors that support moving this item into the “ false ” column : <PARA> the closest match to any of the ideas referenced in the putative quote that we could find was an 18 may 1963 telegram from the department of state to the embassy in israel ( portions of which remained classified ), in which president kennedy expressed reservations about an israeli nuclear weapons program : <PARA> as the kennedy library archivist told us , “ given this evidence to the contrary , it seems rather astounding that jfk could have [ made ] the statement attributed to him .”
true	on 19 july 2016 , actor scott baio ( best known in political circles for his portrayal of fonzie ’ s cousin chachi in the 1970s tv sitcom happy days ) engaged in a contentious debate on msnbc with nbc national correspondent tamron hall , during which baio asserted ( in the video above ) that president obama had once said “ if they bring a knife to an argument , you bring a gun .” <PARA> the exchange in question occurred during a debate over civility , and hall challenged baio over both his own comments as well as comments made by donald trump : <PARA> hall seemed perplexed by the claim and unaware othat president obama had stated any such thing ( for which baio provided no context ). but baio wasn ’ t the first to ascribe the quote to the president in 2016 , as shown in an fox business news segment ( at the end of the video above ) that featured a longer version of the quote and dated it as having been uttered on 13 june 2008 : <PARA> many social media users were skeptical that the quote was legitimate , and baio ’ s manner of describing it didn ’ t make it easier for viewers to pin down the circumstances under which president obama might have said such a thing . that was likely due in part to the passage of time ( more than eight years had gone by since the date appended to the on - screen transcription ), although some people suggested all evidence of the comment had been scrubbed from the internet . <PARA> the quote itself was commonly cited as having been sourced from the mob film the untouchables and also frequently referenced by hip - hop artists . one such instance is the track “ takeover ” by jay - z , of whom the president is a noted fan . <PARA> as it turned out , the comment was indeed made by then - senator obama at a fundraising event in the city of brotherly love , and it was not ignored by mainstream media outlets at the time . the new york times , reported on 14 june 2008 that : <PARA> on the same date , reuters published an item that stated , in part : <PARA> the wall street journal provided a sliver of additional context to the statement : <PARA> we were unable to locate any video of president obama ’ s “ knife to a gun fight ” remarks , but the comments were well documented in contemporaneous news reports .
false	tales about the bermuda triangle ( also known as the devil ’ s triangle ), a region in the western part of the north atlantic ocean where a number of aircraft and ships are claimed to have disappeared under mysterious circumstances , date to the early 1950s . and rumors of a tantalizing crystal pyramid found on ocean ’ s floor go back at least as far as the 1960s , which is when a dr . ray brown claimed he came upon such a structure while scuba diving in the bahamas , as detailed in this 1980 clip from an in search of ... segment on the bimini wall ( an underwater rock formation near north bimini island in the bahamas ): <PARA> as frequently seems to happen with such earth - shaking paranormal discoveries , however , “ dr . brown ’ s photographic equipment was destroyed in the storm ,” thus making it impossible for anyone else to examine or verify “ a detailed record of the find .” and after his supposed incredible discovery of a crystal atlantean pyramid , dr . brown never saw fit to return to the site with additional cameras to document it , even though this amazing structure was supposedly found in an area reachable with ordinary scuba diving gear . <PARA> nonetheless , stories about submerged crystal pyramids remain a popular favorite in paranormal circles , as exemplified by a 3 may 2013 weekly strange video on the subject : <PARA> despite claims that “ in 2012 , american and french research teams stumbled upon an underground structure rising from the seabed ” a discovery that “ rocked scientists around the world ,” one searches in vain to locate the identities of ( or any other information about ) these putative “ research teams ,” or evidence of their releasing articles , photographs , videos , or anything else documenting their incredible discovery . <PARA> the only mystery here is how scientists around the world could have been “ rocked ” by something that they ’ ve never seen , and which exists only in fabricated paranormal pseudo - documentaries .
false	however , there have been no controlled , double - blind , clinical trials on humans that support this claim outside of the lab . in terms of clinical research on humans , a 2012 phase ii , 24 - week , randomized , double - blinded clinical trial of curcumin on 36 individuals with mild to moderate alzheimer ’ s indicated a lack of efficacy : <PARA> “ to our knowledge , [ curcumin ] has never been shown to be conclusively effective in a randomized , placebo - controlled clinical trial for any indication ,” nelson and her colleagues wrote in their 2017 review .
false	one surefire way to get people to share an item on social media is to tell them that facebook ( or twitter or instagram etc ...) is trying to suppress that specific item from spreading . that was the case in november 2018 as facebook users recirculated an image purportedly showing a cross carved in honor of fallen firefighters while simultaneously claiming that this photograph was being deleted by the social network : <PARA> this image is not being deleted by facebook as evidenced by its widespread prevalence on the aforementioned social media network . <PARA> the text associated with this image appears to have originated with an august 14th post by facebook user barbara church . that post , which has racked up nearly 500 , 000 shares since it was initially posted , included the claim that facebook had deleted this image . however , at the time of this writing three months after church ’ s initial post , this item is still available on her page : <PARA> church didn ’ t provide an explanation for why facebook would delete this image , but the insinuation appears to be that it was ( hypothetically ) removed due to its religious nature . however , facebook ’ s community guidelines do not ban religious content . <PARA> this image has been on facebook since at least 30 july 2018 when it was shared by “ california wildfire net ” with the caption : <PARA> that posting is also still available at the time of this writing . <PARA> this isn ’ t the first time that a rumor of this ilk has been shared on facebook . in fact , “ facebook bans _____ ” could be considered its own subsect of internet disinformation . we ’ ve previously investigated false rumors holding that facebook had banned cartoons of president trump , photographs of military amputees , nativity scenes , christian - themed content , the marines corp . emblem , the confederate flag , posts containing the word “ amen ,” atheism , and an image of a little boy saluting an american flag .
false	in early february 2020 , a facebook post circulated claiming the 2020 presidential campaign of former u . s . vice president joe biden removed a flag in a public library in iowa in preparation for an event held there . we include a screen capture of the post with the facebook user ’ s name cropped out for privacy : <PARA> the above post contains elements that are accurate and others that are not . <PARA> the wife of 2020 the presidential candidate , jill biden , did visit the public library in corning , iowa , on jan . 24 , 2020 . and an american flag was moved out of a room in the library where the biden group met . <PARA> what is inaccurate is the assertion that the “ library staff was told to remove the american flag as they did not want to say the pledge of allegiance . the librarian refused so the campaign people went out and took it down themselves !” <PARA> fred shearer , president of the library board , told us by phone that the biden campaign rented a meeting room in the corning public library and arranged the room themselves , and the library staff had nothing to do with that . “ we just rent the room and they arranged it the way they chose ,” shearer said . <PARA> the biden team moved a roughly 5 - foot - tall flag pole with an american flag in the corner of the room “ probably 5 feet into a hallway next to the room ,” shearer added . <PARA> we reached out to the biden campaign to ask why someone moved the flag . a spokesperson for the campaign informed us that jill biden had nothing to do with that action . instead , a campaign staffer noticed the flag was not dressed properly , meaning the way it was displayed did not meet etiquette standards , and the problem couldn ’ t be resolved in time for the event . <PARA> the spokesperson added that the decision had nothing to do with reciting the pledge of allegiance and pointed out that joe biden ’ s deceased son , beau , was an iraq war veteran . <PARA> the allegation that american flags were absent or otherwise disrespected at political events is a common election season trope , and it is often misleading .
unproven	a set of gruesome photographs supposedly showing the aftermath of a “ pico jackfruit snake ” bite is frequently shared online . we ’ ll be posting these photographs below . as they show a severe hand injury , this article may not suitable for all viewers . <PARA> the photographs first went viral in august 2017 after they were posted to the facebook group faculty of veterinary medicine in new york . the first photograph in the set shows what appears to be a small cut on a person ’ s thumb . subsequent photographs show the injury worsening , due to the snake ’ s venomous bite , until eventually the thumb is amputated . <PARA> again , the following photographs may not be suitable for all viewers : <PARA> we haven ’ t been able to uncover too many specifics about these photographs , such as where they were taken or the identity of the snake - bit victim . when these images first started circulating on facebook in 2017 ( the original post has since been deleted ), the snake was identified as a “ sharp - nosed viper ,” not a “ pico jackfruit snake .” <PARA> in fact , we found no snake by the latter ’ s name . it likely refers to a bushmaster snake , another genus of venomous pit - vipers , which is known by a variety of names across south america , such as the pineapple snake , the silent rattlesnake , and the stinging jackfruit . <PARA> regardless of the specific species of snake , these photographs appear to provide a genuine look at the painful aftermath of a venomous snakebite . news . com . au talked to brian fry , an associate professor in the school of biological sciences at the university of queensland , when these images first went viral : <PARA> while we haven ’ t been able to find much information about this specific set of photographs , we have found other snake - bite cases that resulted in similar injuries . a 2015 article from the bbc explained some of the science behind deadly venomous snake bites : <PARA> in sum , the above photographs most likely show the gruesome aftermath of a snake bite , but because we were unable to uncover specific details about the pictures , we ’ ve rated this claim “ unproven .”

false	false <PARA> origins : on 12 july 2015 , the web site united media publishing posted an article titled “ pope suggests mandatory sterilization of unwed mothers could prevent climate change .” that article included a purported quote from pope francis linking childbirth with climate change and advocating the sterilization of women who bear children outside of marriage : <PARA> pope francis made no such remarks , and a statement to that effect would be quite newsworthy given the catholic church ‘ s historically strong opposition to sterilization ( and contraceptive use ) in general . <PARA> united media publishing ‘ s web site doesn ’ t feature a disclaimer informing readers that its content is comprised entirely of fake news . however , previous articles from that outlet include a fabricated claim that charles manson had died in prison , a story woven from whole cloth suggesting christian couples are “ divorcing en masse ” in protest of same - sex marriage , and another positing that transgender tampons have been developed and will be sold in stores . <PARA> originally published : 13 july 2015
false	on 26 october 2015 , numerous african web sites published articles claiming republican presidential candidate donald trump made a host of racist remarks at an unspecified event in indianapolis . the first version appeared to be a 25 october 2015 article on the web site politica ( not to be confused with the u . s .- based political news site politico ), which reported that trump made the comments in indianapolis ( but lacked a date , context , and the name or type of event at which trump purportedly spoke ): <PARA> trump indeed spoke publicly on 25 october 2015 , when he appeared on cbs ’ sunday morning political interview show face the nation . on twitter , trump detailed his movements throughout the day : <PARA> we were unable to locate any instances in which trump visited indianapolis at any point in october 2015 . moreover , the comments attributed to trump ( purportedly spoken to an american audience in a u . s . city ) by african web sites rated as far more offensive than prior controversial remarks made by the candidate in the past that were widely reported by the u . s . news media , yet for some reason this purported quote didn ’ t attract the attention of a single u . s .- based political blog or web site . <PARA> it beggared belief that trump would say such things in the united states at what was ostensibly a campaign event , yet no american political web sites reported on the remarks . as with an earlier spurious trump quote , rumors that the candidate described black people as lazy , sex - crazed thieves appeared to be a work of political fan fiction .
false	the speaking appearance of muslim attorney and gold star father khizr khan at the 2016 democratic national convention , at which he criticized republican nominee donald trump for his lack of empathy for immigrants , unleashed a firestorm of rebukes and attempts to discredit him , including unsubstantiated allegations that khan has “ deep legal and financial connections ” to democratic nominee hillary clinton . <PARA> one of those attempts hinged on an image ( see below ) purporting to show a wells fargo bank statement in the name of khan ’ s law firm which lists a $ 375 , 000 wire transfer from the clinton foundation , bill clinton ’ s nonprofit organization devoted to addressing global issues . exactly how and where it originated is unknown , but the image made one of its first appearances on a page dated 4 august 2016 on the get off the bs web site , where it was introduced as follows : <PARA> the document appears to be a wells fargo business market savings account statement for the km khan law office , address listed as 415 madison ave ., suite 1500 , new york , ny . in the transaction history is an 8 / 1 “ clinton foundation incoming wire ” entry credited in the amount of $ 375 , 000 . one of the first things you ’ ll note about the document , however , is that it ’ s heavily redacted — so heavily that you can ’ t even find a complete date on it anywhere . the second thing you ’ ll notice , if you look carefully , is that the business name is listed twice in the document , and the listings don ’ t match . <PARA> first it ’ s listed as “ km khan law office ”: <PARA> then it ’ s listed as “ jm khan law office ”: <PARA> at some point as the image was being passed around and reposted , someone noticed the discrepancy and created a new version : <PARA> but if you ’ ll notice , the new version has a defect as well : “ km khan law office ” — singular — has now become “ km khan law offices ” — plural . <PARA> this forged document — pick your favorite version , it doesn ’ t matter — would have been laughed out of a court of law . indeed , the “ evidence ” is so inconsistent that it ’ s hard to believe anyone could mistake it , much less try to pass it off , as real . needless to say , it doesn ’ t prove that khizr khan received $ 375 , 000 from the clinton foundation ; all it proves is that someone wants you to think he did .
false	with the wedding of prince harry and meghan markle scheduled to take place on 19 may 2018 , the british tabloids have kicked into overdrive with gossip and speculation about behind - the - scenes drama in britain ’ s royal family . <PARA> anonymous sources were cited toward the end of december 2017 in reports that markle was asked to sign a prenuptial agreement , sparking a “ first fight ” between the bride - to - be and prince harry . on the internet this unsubstantiated rumor devolved into the full - fledged claim that queen elizabeth has “ suspended ” the wedding until the prenuptial is signed . <PARA> according to a 27 december article on the unreliable web site yournewswire , some of markle ’ s controversial public statements were also a factor in the alleged suspension : <PARA> we ’ ve found no real - world evidence that any of the above is the case , however . <PARA> although it ’ s true that markle , an american actress best known for her ongoing role in the television series suits , describes herself as an “ activist ” on her twitter profile and has been known to take political stands , particularly on women ’ s issues , she has not tweeted at all since march 2017 . and although it ’ s true that markle labeled then - presidential candidate donald trump “ divisive ” and “ misogynistic ” during a may 2016 television interview , she has made no recent public statements interpretable as “ spreading divisive ideology .” <PARA> one sign that markle has already been accepted by the royal family was her invitation to the 2017 christmas festivities at the queen ’ s country estate in norfolk . according to the british press , it was the first time someone who has yet to marry into the family was invited to attend such an occasion . <PARA> the queen ’ s formal consent is required before prince harry can marry ( under the current rules of royal succession ), but according to historian retha warnicke , an expert on british royal families of the past , the odds are virtually nil that she would withhold such permission . <PARA> it also appears unlikely that a prenuptial agreement will be demanded or signed before the wedding can take place . a british family law attorney consulted by us weekly cited the precedent set by both prince william ( harry ’ s brother ) and prince charles ( his father ), neither of whom entered into a prenuptial agreement before they were wed . <PARA> your news wire is a highly partisan fake news web site with a long history of publishing sensationalized and fabricated content .
false	a june 2019 facebook post offered a photograph of gene hackman along with a putative quote from actor proclaiming that “ donald trump could easily turn out to be one of the best presidents that america has ever seen ”: <PARA> putting unlikely ( particularly pro - trump ) statements in the mouths of celebrities became something of a cottage industry for fake news promulgators around the time of the 2016 u . s . presidential election , and this item was one of that ilk . this quote did not originate with a genuine statement from the academy award - winning actor , but rather with a november 2018 article from the ( no longer active ) coolinfo24 . com junk news site reporting on a supposed interview with hackman : <PARA> the coolinfo24 . com article actually used a truncated version of a statement attributed to sheffield - born entrepreneur and nightclub owner peter stringfellow , which the south yorkshire times reported on when stringfellow passed away in june 2018 . <PARA> according to the times , stringfellow met trump at a party thrown by hackman in the 1980s , and when trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the united states in january 2017 , stringfellow offered the much more ambiguous statement that trump could turn out to the be “ one of the best presidents that america has ever seen ... or one of the worst ”:
unproven	on 28 january 2017 , the palmer report blog posted a story reporting that top advisers to president donald trump believe he is misleading them about the veracity of allegations that russians are keeping compromising information about him , and that they could potentially use it to blackmail him . the story was based entirely on posts made by an anonymous twitter user under an account called “ rogue potus staff ”: <PARA> the story linked to the following message , which was posted on 28 january 2017 ( palmer says the “ unholy trinity ” refers to rnc chair reince priebus , house speaker paul ryan and vice president mike pence ): <PARA> the “ attempts at blackmail ” seem to be a reference to a dossier filled with claims about alleged ties between russia and trump , none of which has been verified . <PARA> the “ rogue potus staff ” twitter feed is a stream of what appear to be observations from one or more persons on the inside of the president ’ s circle : <PARA> that twitter user also claims statements made are prescient , thereby proving validity : <PARA> ( the above statement claimed trump would sign an executive order curtailing lgbt rights , which turned out to be false .) because the identity of the person using the twitter account is unknown and the allegations in the referenced dossier are unverified , no substantive evidence proves the claim that trump ’ s advisers believe he is compromised and is misleading them about it . nor does it prove whether the twitter user is indeed an insider , or just a very observant monitor of the news .
false	in june 2017 , a blurry black and white image showing a group of nude people dancing around a circle appeared with text claiming that it shows sen . elizabeth warren ( d - massachusetts ) performing a pagan ritual : <PARA> the text included with the image was originally published in a hoax article on thelastlineofdefense . org , a web site with a long and storied history of posting factually challenged stories . to its credit , the web site does carry a clear disclaimer : <PARA> although we have not been able to definitively determine a time and place for the photograph , several sources claim that it shows a man named alex sanders ( far right in the robe ) leading a “ skyclad ritual ” somewhere in the united kingdom . sanders , who was known as the “ king of the witches ,” founded alexandrian wicca in the 1960s : <PARA> alex sanders and his wife later consulted on the 1966 movie eye of the devil . a photograph of alex , maxine , and the film ’ s star sharon tate appears to show a circle similar to the pagan ritual shown above : <PARA> elizabeth warren did enter college in the 1960s ; she was born in 1949 , and then accepted into george washington university at just sixteen years old . she put her college career aside after just two years , however , dropping out to marry a nasa engineer she had been dating throughout her teens , then moving with him from job to job : she finished her undergraduate degree in houston , taught elementary school , and then enrolled in law school at rutgers , earning her j . d . when she was nine months pregnant and then going directly into law , then academia , with her new baby in tow . <PARA> nothing in her history suggests she ever practiced wicca or danced “ skyclad ” in cabalistic and obscure rituals , or had the time to do so . but speculation is unnecessary ; people change their haircuts throughout their lives for one reason or another , and images of warren from that time in her life clearly show someone with long dark hair : <PARA> warren had her first child at age 22 , and hair requires months , if not years , to grow to the length it appears in this image . the image used in this meme had nothing to do with warren , and the meme itself is easily debunked by the barest of google searches .
false	incorrectly attributed <PARA> origins : in june 2015 , an op - ed entitled “ the black dilemma ” was circulated online along with an attribution to the baltimore sun newspaper : <PARA> while many online postings of the above - displayed article in june 2015 claimed that it had been recently published in baltimore sun , this article has actually been circulating on the internet since at least september 2014 , when it was published under the title “ ten percent is not enough ” in the american renaissance blog . <PARA> the american renaissance posting was originally attributed to anthony bryan ; but his name was stripped from versions shared via internet forums , craigslist postings , and comments sections of several race - related articles . several different authorial names have been attached to the piece , including “ john s . mosby ” ( a confederate cavalry officer ) and “ edmund hughes ,” but the article didn ’ t truly go viral until after the baltimore sun attribution was tacked on .
false	in late 2019 , we received multiple inquiries from readers about the veracity of a widely shared facebook meme that warned readers of a sinister sex trafficking plot at work in florence , kentucky , and other parts of that state . <PARA> the meme typically featured a photograph of a red rose attached to the door of a white car with the following text : <PARA> “ there have been recent incidents in northern kentucky about sex traffickers leaving roses on victim ’ s [ sic ] cars . the roses have a chemical on them to make you pass out , so they can grab you . one incident happened in the walmart parking lot in florence , ky ! please be careful , ladies !” <PARA> this particular claim was bogus . the picture used in the meme could not have come from the scene of an attempted kidnapping , or emerged from a wider sex trafficking scheme in kentucky in late 2019 , because we found it used in an entirely unrelated blog post from 2015 : <PARA> we asked florence police department whether they had any knowledge of any recent pattern of attempted kidnappings or any sex trafficking schemes , whether involving mysteriously placed roses or not . capt . gregory rehkamp was unequivocal in his response : <PARA> “ this is completely unfounded and has been floating around for quite a long time . there have been zero incidents anywhere in florence , or anywhere else that i have heard , of anything remotely related to this .” <PARA> the 2019 “ rose ” hoax was not the first sex trafficking scare to emerge from kentucky in recent years . in late 2017 , some social media users in the louisville and florence area in the north of the state claimed to have been approached or harassed in public . those purported incidents were quickly linked , without evidence , to human trafficking , and the local branch of a controversial church was forced to defend its member against allegations of sex trafficking , as reported by wdrb news at the time : <PARA> in december 2017 , florence police posted on facebook , clarifying that “ there is no credible link to the group and any known instances of human trafficking .” the statement read : <PARA> “ we have received several inquiries over the last few days regarding facebook posts about people being approached / questioned by strangers and the concerns over the possible link to human trafficking . while we encourage everyone to remain diligent , at this time , there is no credible link to the group and any known instances of human trafficking . we are still actively investigating however please be aware that the information regarding this activity appears to be largely speculation and hearsay fueled by social media .” <PARA> again in the fall of 2019 , the church became the subject of unfounded sex trafficking allegations , related to purported incidents of churchgoers approaching members of the public in louisville , this time inviting them to bible study groups . at first wdrb fueled speculation , asking in a report “ is it an innocent invitation or a trap ?” later , the church once again rejected any claims of a link to any sex trafficking operation , and no evidence has emerged showing that the actions of church members form part of a sex trafficking plot , rather than part of the organization ’ s reportedly unconventional and somewhat aggressive recruitment style .
true	on jan . 9 , 2020 , u . s . president donald trump posted a tweet , written partially in all - capital letters , asking people how their “ 409k ’ s ” are doing , and although he deleted the tweet and re - posted it without the “ 409k ” reference , the errant tweet was captured by at least two archiving services . <PARA> trump then deleted that tweet and posted a new tweet , substituting in the correct reference , “ 401k .” <PARA> a 401 ( k ) is a retirement - savings benefit offered to employees by some companies . funds are generally automatically deducted from paychecks and deposited into an account that is tied to stocks . therefore the performance of 401 ( k ) accounts are linked to the highs and lows of the stock market . <PARA> many americans , however , do not have access to this benefit , as it is dependent on their employer . regardless of whether they have one , most americans do not have enough money saved for retirement , according to economic data . <PARA> u . s . stocks have been experiencing a record bull market for roughly a decade , which trump generally claims credit for , although it started under his predecessor , barack obama .
true	origins : austria is indeed home to a town called ‘ fucking ’ ( 48o <PARA> 04 ’ n 12o 51 ’ e ), a name derived from that of ‘ focko ,’ a 6th century bavarian nobleman . and as noted in a telegraph article about residents ’ considering a change in spelling for the town ’ s name , the locals do have quite a problem dealing with stolen signs : <PARA> for centuries the tiny village in northern austria lived life in happy obscurity , but life changed when us troops , stationed in the area at the end of the second world war , discovered it , and since then the village ’ s name has been a constant source of amusement for tourists and irritation for locals . <PARA> at least 13 £ 250 road signs bearing the village ’ s name have been stolen , and the sight of semi - naked women posing for photographs beside signs has become a common sight . one local business woman , exasperated with people stealing her sign has taken to adding another “ g ” in the hope it will deter thieves . <PARA> a brisk market in postcards and christmas cards making liberal use of the name have also managed to spread its fame . <PARA> in an attempt to curtail the fun had at the village ’ s expense some locals want to readopt its 16th - century spelling and replace the “ ck ” with a single or double “ g ”. <PARA> at least 13 £ 250 road signs bearing the village ’ s name have been stolen , and the sight of semi - naked women posing for photographs beside signs has become a common sight . one local business woman , exasperated with people stealing her sign has taken to adding another “ g ” in the hope it will deter thieves . <PARA> a brisk market in postcards and christmas cards making liberal use of the name have also managed to spread its fame . <PARA> in an attempt to curtail the fun had at the village ’ s expense some locals want to readopt its 16th - century spelling and replace the “ ck ” with a single or double “ g ”. <PARA> here are a few photos of the hard - to - keep signs : <PARA> the second sign carries the hilarity even further : “ bitte — nicht so schnell !” is german for “ please — not so fast !” ( evidently this type of sign is a commonplace reminder in those parts for motorists to keep their speed down to protect children , but many viewers find the unintended double meaning in this case particularly amusing .)
unproven	this legend has circulated in great britain at least since 1972 . <PARA> author douglas adams tells the “ packet of biscuits ” tale in his 1984 novel so long , and thanks for all the fish . he has since recounted it on numerous occasions , claiming it happened to him in 1976 at a station in cambridge . <PARA> his claim is doubted by many who point out the self - same tale was around years prior to that , but it is not impossible for events in real life to mimic those of lore . ( indeed , the actual folkloric term for such an event is ostension .) in any case , whether the incident happened to him or not , it is clear the legend did not begin with him : <PARA> examples : <PARA> variations : <PARA> numerous stories about unwitting thieves abound in the realm of contemporary lore , with the “ victim turned thief ” motif appearing in such tales since the early 1900s . ( visit our pocket ( ed ) watch , gun - toting grannies , and jogger ’ s billfold pages for other legends of this type .) <PARA> as folklorist jan harold brunvand put it , “ all variations on the theme of unwitting theft portray a plausible situation in which we ourselves might act in such an uncharacteristic threatening manner because of a simple misunderstanding .” in this legend , the “ plausible situation ” impels a woman one presumes would not normally make a spectacle of herself to angrily glare at a stranger , screech at him , lecture him , or even defiantly grab a food item she knows is his and tear a bite out of it . <PARA> because of the way the characters are presented ( the woman exudes a faintly aristocratic aura while the man is described as a leather - clad punk , a foreigner , or an insolent - appearing young person ), the woman ’ s social lapse is more glaring . we forgive her outburst at the time ... but afterwards have a chance to reflect on how she handled the situation and conclude there had to have been a better way . <PARA> her lapse and the awareness of how she must have appeared to others serves as a caution against our taking similar action in any potentially confrontational encounter that occurs in public . we might not always have all of the facts we think we do . moreover , even if we do have all the facts , we ’ re going to look like a right idiot to anyone looking on . <PARA> sightings : both the 1990 film the lunch date and the 1989 film boeuf bourgignon make use of this legend . in both , a well - dressed white woman goes off to fetch silverware and returns to find a black man eating her lunch . only after she shares her dinner with the stranger ( at one point he fetches coffee for the two of them ) and the man leaves does she notice her own meal sitting on another table . <PARA> the 2010 ian mcewan novel solar contains an interesting sighting of the legend , where it is both related as a true story undergone by the book ’ s protagonist and afterwards challenged by a folklorist he encounters on its basis as an urban legend of long standing .
mixture	friends - <PARA> i am sending this email to the majority of my address book – please pass this one on . it is so important ! <PARA> we were in seaside , florida , 2 weeks ago and decided to allow our children to get “ henna tattoos ” – the adults decided to indulge , as well . this was done at a very nice , “ high - end ” place – next to $ 2 – 3 million dollar homes . i asked if it was “ safe ” for children and was assured that it was a “ natural ” dye with no consequence . <PARA> 10 days later , my 7 yr . old and my 5 yr . old are having “ severe ” allergic reactions to the “ black henna ”. their tattoos will now , most likely , be permanent scars . they are reacting to ppd – a substance added to natural henna to make it more “ black ” and allow it to set more quickly . <PARA> now that my girls have been exposed to ppd – they can never have their hair dyed – as it could be fatal . they can not ever use paba – based sunscreens , they can not have “ sulfa ” anti - biotics , they can not use most cosmetics , and they can not have most drugs ending in “- caine ”. our first visit is to the dermatologist tomorrow and then to the allergist to determine the life long consequences of this exposure . <PARA> please do not allow your children to get these “ all natural henna tattoos ” unless you are 100 % sure they are pure henna ( which has a much lower rate of allergic reaction ). make sure they do not contain ppd ! it can be a life altering decision . <PARA> take care , <PARA> origins : while we can ’ t yet confirm this particular story about the two tots permanently scarred by temporary henna tattoos applied in seaside , florida , the risks decried in the account are at least somewhat real . <PARA> for thousands of years , people have relied on henna , an old world tropical shrub of the loosestrife family , to color their hair and decorate their skin . pure henna is green but <PARA> dries to a dark brown or orange hue . to create body art ( also known as mehndi ), henna is mixed into a paste with essential oils and applied to the skin in intricate patterns . when left on the skin for at least four hours , the paste produces patterns that last up to just over three weeks . <PARA> temporary tattoos worked in pure henna are generally safe . ( it is extremely rare to develop an allergic reaction to pure henna .) however , those executed in “ black henna ” are not always so . <PARA> black henna is a ppd - boosted synthetic version of the real thing . para - phenylenediamine ( ppd ) is used in these concoctions to darken designs and thereby produce dramatic black patterns . black henna can make delicate skin erupt into blistering redness that sometimes leads to permanent scarring . the reaction can also spread , causing grotesque full - body swelling , itching , and skin sloughing . <PARA> black henna is not always safe to use . permanent scarring can result from its application , and a tattoo meant to be worn for a few days can become a lifelong mark . also , someone who has had a bad reaction to black henna may afterwards become extra - sensitive to ppd and similar chemicals , including some antibiotics and local anesthetics . future reactions will likely be more severe . <PARA> even when there isn ’ t an immediate bad reaction to a tattoo worked in black henna , just having had that form of skin art can set up the wearer for misery in the future . thanks to the concentration of ppd in the formulation used to execute skin designs ( up to 15 . 7 %), the temporary tattoo sensitizes its wearer to that chemical . more than two - thirds of hair dyes currently contain ppd or related chemicals , which means the former tattoo wearer may well experience a delayed hypersensitivity reaction when she decides years later to change her hair color . said reaction can range anywhere from redness and irritation around the hairline and scalp to complete swelling of the face and a rash all over the body . <PARA> in 2006 , the american contact dermatitis society named ppd its “ allergen of the year .” <PARA> the food and drug administration ( fda ) has this to say about temporary or henna tattoos : <PARA> since henna typically produces a brown , orange - brown , or reddish - brown tint , other ingredients must be added to produce other colors , such as those marketed as “ black henna ” and “ blue henna .” so - called “ black henna ” may contain the “ coal tar ” color p - phenylenediamine , also known as ppd . this ingredient may cause allergic reactions in some individuals . the only legal use of ppd in cosmetics is as a hair dye . it is not approved for direct application to the skin . even brown shades of products marketed as henna may contain other ingredients intended to make them darker or make the stain last longer . <PARA> in addition to color additives , these skin - decorating products may contain other ingredients , such as solvents . <PARA> in addition to color additives , these skin - decorating products may contain other ingredients , such as solvents . <PARA> in 2002 , north wildwood , on an island off the new jersey shore , joined neighboring oceanfront resort wildwood in banning henna tattoos because it found it impossible to determine which contained fda - approved dyes and which didn ’ t . <PARA> barbara “ banned on the run ” mikkelson

true	in mid - november 2018 , a number of news stories cropped up reporting that first lady melania trump had spent $ 174 , 000 on hotel rooms during a day trip to toronto more than one year earlier . u . s . taxpayers did foot a $ 174 , 000 hotel room bill for melania ’ s visit , although it was the u . s . state department that ran up the expenditures and not mrs . trump . <PARA> on 23 september 2017 , melania trump led an american delegation on a trip to canada for the invictus games , an olympic - style competition launched in 2014 by prince harry , in which wounded service members compete . while there , the first lady met with the athletes as well as with prince harry and canadian prime minister justin trudeau . federal spending records show that the u . s . state department paid $ 174 , 000 for a series of expenses labeled “ hotel rooms - flotus ” made to “ miscellaneous foreign awardees ” in relation to the trip . <PARA> according to the associated press , the delegation consisted of then - veterans affairs secretary david shulkin , professional golfer nancy lopez , and entertainer wayne newton . it ’ s unclear if the expenses for the trip covered for the presence of these other personalities as well . ( we sent emails seeking comment to the first lady ’ s spokeswoman , stephanie grisham , and the state department but haven ’ t received responses to either .) <PARA> most of the stories about the hotel charges were cribbed from a 15 november 2018 report published by the business - oriented news site quartz , which sourced the data from the government spending tracking tool usaspending . gov . under the headline “ melania trump racked up $ 174 , 000 in hotel bills for a day trip to toronto ,” quartz reported : <PARA> the expenses listed on usaspending . gov don ’ t specify which hotels were paid , but quartz pointed to press pool reports that mrs . trump had visited the sheraton and ritz - carlton in toronto for functions during the trip . quartz also quoted grisham , who referred to an “ advance team ” that goes ahead of a visit to make sure the vip traveler ’ s concerns are met : <PARA> but according to quartz ‘ s report , expenses associated with the advance team were broken out separately from the $ 174 , 000 figure and only totaled a fraction of the trip ’ s overall hotel room expenses , a discrepancy that was not explained : <PARA> quartz reported that when they asked the state department for further details relating to the expenses , they were instructed to file a freedom of information act ( foia ) request . <PARA> a number of news outlets and websites picked up the story , and although some readers were led to believe that the first lady personally spent $ 174 , 000 in taxpayer money at toronto hotels , that is not the case . a similar controversy cropped up around a $ 95 , 000 hotel bill associated with mrs . trump ’ s six - hour stop in cairo during her october 2018 trip to africa . as with the expenses in cairo , the expenditures in toronto were run up by the state department prior to the first lady ’ s arrival . <PARA> the quartz story also pointed out that first lady michelle obama in 2014 generated a comparable amount in hotel charges during a two - day trip in 2014 to chengdu , china : <PARA> both mrs . trump ’ s and mrs . obama ’ s travel expenditures have been the sources of scrutiny and controversy . in 2012 , for example , conservative media was alight with reports that mrs . obama ’ s trip to spain with one of her children and the secret service in tow cost u . s . taxpayers nearly $ 470 , 000 .
false	this should really be a cause for great concern . <PARA> to those who voted for him , you have elected the biggest unqualified fraud that america has ever known ! <PARA> this is very interesting stuff . sort of adds credence to the idea of the manchurian candidate thing having happened here ! stephanopoulos of abc news said the same thing during the 08 ′ campaign . he too was a classmate of bo ’ s at columbia class of 1984 . he said he never had one class with him . <PARA> was he there ? <PARA> while he is such a great orator , why doesn ’ t anyone in obama ’ s college class remember him ? maybe he never attended class ! maybe he never attended columbia ? he won ’ t allow colombia to release his records either . suspicious isn ’ t it ??? <PARA> nobody remembers obama at columbia !!!!!!! <PARA> looking for evidence of obama ’ s past , fox news contacted 400 columbia university students from the period when obama claims to have been there , but none remembered him . <PARA> wayne allyn root was , like obama , a political science major at columbia who also graduated in 1983 . in 2008 , root says of obama , “ i don ’ t know a single person at columbia that knew him , and they all know me . i don ’ t have a classmate who ever knew barack obama at columbia . ever ! nobody recalls him . i ’ m not exaggerating , i ’ m not kidding . <PARA> root adds that he was also , like obama , “ class of ’ 83 political science , pre - law ” and says , “ you don ’ t get more exact or closer than that . never met him in my life , don ’ t know anyone who ever met him . <PARA> at the class reunion , our 20th reunion five years ago , who was asked to be the speaker of the class ? me . no one ever heard of barack ! and five years ago , nobody even knew who he was . the guy who writes the class notes , who ’ s kind of the , as we say in new york , the macha who knows everybody , has yet to find a person , a human who ever met him . is that not strange ?” <PARA> it ’ s very strange . “ obama ’ s photograph does not appear in the school ’ s yearbook and obama consistently declines requests to talk about his years at columbia , provide schoolrecords , or provide the name of any former classmates or friends while at columbia .” <PARA> <URL> <PARA> note : root graduated as valedictorian from his high school , thornton - donovan school , then graduated from columbia university in 1983 as a political science major ( in the same class as president barack obama was supposed to have been in ). <PARA> can it be that bho is a complete fraud ?? more intrigue concerning “ the man who wasn ’ t there .” <PARA> origins : those who have followed the background of president barack obama are familiar with the arc of his post - secondary education : after finishing high school in 1979 , he attended occidental college in los angeles for two years , transferred to columbia college in new york city ( one of columbia university ’ s four undergraduate schools ) for another two years , graduated from columbia with a bachelor ’ s degree in political science , and then ( after a five - year interlude during which he traveled and worked as a community organizer ) entered harvard law school in 1988 and graduated with a law degree in 1991 . <PARA> even those who have studied barack obama ’ s background in detail don ’ t generally know much about his time at columbia university , however , as he hasn ’ t revealed much about that period of his life in his public writings and statements , nor has he made his transcripts or other school records from columbia available <PARA> for public examination . obama ’ s reticence about revealing much from this period of his life has given license to a number of related rumors , the most outlandish of them being the claim outlined above that he fabricated this element of his background and didn ’ t really attend columbia at all . <PARA> most expressions of this rumor feed off the statement ( referenced in a wall street journal editorial ) that “ fox news contacted some 400 of [ obama ’ s ] classmates and found no one who remembered him ” and a statement made by wayne allyn root ( the libertarian party ’ s 2008 vice presidential nominee who also attended columbia at the same time as barack obama ) that “ i don ’ t know a single person at columbia that knows him , and they all know me . i don ’ t have a classmate who ever knew barack obama at columbia .” <PARA> as literally true as these statements might be , they don ’ t prove that barack obama never attended columbia — at best they demonstrate there was nothing particularly remarkable or distinguished about him at that point in his life that others found memorable 25 years after the fact . barack obama himself would likely agree with that assessment , as he noted himself that he spent his time at columbia largely alone and isolated : <PARA> in his memoir and in interviews , obama has said he got serious and buckled down in new york . “ i didn ’ t socialize that much . i was like a monk ,” he said in a 2005 columbia alumni magazine interview . he told biographer david mendell : “ for about two years there , i was just painfully alone and really not focused on anything , except maybe thinking a lot .” <PARA> although barack obama may not have been particularly social or memorable during his years at columbia , it isn ’ t true that “ no one ever came forward from obama ’ s past saying they knew him , attended school with him , was his friend , etc .” those who have attested to having daily personal experience with him during his time at that school include : <PARA> likewise , other external evidence documents barack obama ’ s presence at columbia from 1981 - 83 , including : <PARA> finally , the fatal flaw in the “ obama didn ’ t go to columbia ” theory is that he couldn ’ t have been admitted to harvard law school in 1988 without having received an undergraduate degree . if he wasn ’ t attending columbia from 1981 - 83 , he would have had to complete two full years ’ worth of coursework at ( and graduate from ) some other accredited college — yet his time between the end of his columbia days in 1983 and his entering harvard law in 1988 is accounted for ( working at the business international corporation and the new york public interest research group , then serving as director of the developing communities project in chicago ), and no other school claims him as an alumnus , nor does anyone purport to have encountered him as a classmate or student at any other college or university during that period .
mixture	president donald trump came under another round of criticism on 22 april 2018 , after tweeting at nbc news host chuck todd with a nickname that has long been used in anti - semitic circles . that day , the president wrote : <PARA> the remark came after todd appeared on the today show to discuss an announcement by north korea that it would suspend both nuclear testing and launching intercontinental ballistic missiles ahead of both a scheduled summit with south korea , and a prospective summit with the united states . <PARA> “ so far , in this potential summit north koreans have gotten a lot of out it , what has the united states gotten yet ?” todd asked : <PARA> a search of the president ’ s twitter history shows that he has referred to todd as “ sleepy eyes ” on several occasions , going as far back as february 2012 ; in september 2011 , he first called todd “ sleepy .” trump referred to todd again as “ sleepy eyes ” in 2013 , 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . in february 2016 , he also referred to former florida gov . jeb bush as “ sleepy .” trump also called todd “ sleepy eyes ” and “ a sleeping son of a bitch ” during a speech in pennsylvania in march 2018 . his most recent use of the phrase led to accusations online of anti - semitism . <PARA> aaron breitbart , the senior researcher for the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles , took exception to the criticism surrounding trump ’ s remark . “ i don ’ t think in that context it was meant as an anti - semitic remark ,” breitbart told us . “ the [ term ] ‘ sleepy eyes ’ in itself , has no anti - semitic connotation .” <PARA> todd addressed the “ sleepy eyes ” nickname in an interview published in november 2017 , saying that the president thought it was “ funny .” however , he said , trump did not give a reason behind it . <PARA> “ i ’ ve asked him what the sleepy eyes means . he doesn ’ t know ,” todd said at the time . “ he said once ‘ i give someone a nickname i stay with it . sometimes i give someone a nickname and i can ’ t remember how i came up with it but i stick with it .'” the meet the press host — who was raised in the jewish religion — added that he did not take offense at being called “ sleepy eyes .” <PARA> breitbart did confirm that while the descriptor in and of itself is not anti - semitic , it has been used by white nationalists and nazis in documents containing “ lists ” of “ telltale ” physical markers for jewish people , including one document circulating online that was promoted by a user on the white nationalist web site stormfront : <PARA> an excerpt from the 1938 anti - semitic children ’ s book der giftpilz (“ the poisonous mushroom ”) also makes reference to eyes being a jewish physical “ marker ”: <PARA> the title of der giftpilz comes from propaganda distributed by nazis and nazi sympathizers : <PARA> ultimately , breitbart told us , one must consider the source when trying to determine whether “ sleepy eyes ” is being used as an anti - semitic insult . <PARA> “ if a guy says , ‘ you ’ ve got sleepy eyes ,’ generally that means i look tired ,” he said . “ to me that ’ s not an anti - semitic remark .”
true	in 1990 , congress passed and president george h . w . bush signed into law the americans with disabilities act ( ada ), which extended federal civil rights protections to people with mental or physical impairments : <PARA> more than a quarter - century on , and despite further work to be done , the ada has so positively affected how people with disabilities are treated and perceived in america that the notion that laws once existed to keep physically and cognitively challenged people indoors and out of sight seems scarcely believable . but it was the case — and not so long ago . <PARA> beginning in the late 1800s , statutes known as “ unsightly beggar ordinances ,” aka “ ugly laws ,” were enacted in some american cities to rid public spaces of what chicago alderman james peevey euphemistically referred to as “ street obstructions ”: <PARA> following the example of san francisco , which had pioneered the legislation in 1867 , peevey helped pass a law in 1881 imposing fines ( or stints in the poorhouse ) on all who were “ diseased , maimed , mutilated , or in any way deformed , so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object ,” yet dared beg , panhandle , or otherwise make nuisances of themselves in public . among other cities , omaha , columbus , cleveland , and portland , oregon followed suit , all passing ugly laws using virtually identical language . <PARA> in a discussion of susan m . schweik ’ s the ugly laws : disability in public ( 2009 ), reviewer shannon sommer encapsulates the social and economic developments leading up to these measures : <PARA> schweik notes that though the passage of new ugly laws ceased by the beginning of world war i and enforcement of existing statutes dwindled thereafter , they remained on the books until well into the latter half of the 20th century : <PARA> that same year , 1974 , saw the demise of ugly laws in america . the last city to repeal was chicago . one of the alderman responsible for killing the law , paul t . wigoda , denounced it as “ cruel and insensitive ,” and “ a throwback to the middle ages .” it had been in effect for 93 years .
true	origins : red skelton , a veteran comic who successfully plied his trade as a sentimental clown figure in vaudeville and radio , delighted television audiences for twenty years playing characters he had perfected <PARA> on radio — clem kadiddlehopper , freddie the freeloader , and the mean widdle kid — on his weekly variety television program , “ the red skelton show .” <PARA> on 14 january 1969 , skelton offered his television audience his reminiscence of an incident from his schoolboy days in indiana . mr . lasswell , skelton ’ s teacher , felt his students had come to regard the pledge of allegiance as a daily drudgery to be recited by rote ; they had lost any sense of the meaning of the words they were speaking . as skelton related the story , mr . lasswell told his class : “ i ’ ve been listening to you boys and girls recite the pledge of allegiance all semester and it seems as though it ’ s becoming monotonous to you . if i may , may i recite it and try to explain to you the meaning of each word ?” <PARA> skelton then delivered to his audience ( accompanied by a background of string music ) a stirring version of the explanation provided to his school class by their teacher so many years earlier ( and a recitation of the pledge itself ), as quoted above . skelton ’ s explication and rendition of the pledge of allegiance proved to be quite popular and widely acclaimed , and in response to public demand it was issued in print and pressed into <PARA> records . <PARA> but in 1969 , the supreme court decisions that eliminated compulsory prayer and bible reading in public schools as unconstitutional , abington school district v . schempp and <PARA> murray v . curlett , were still fairly recent ( having been handed down in 1963 ), and protests over american military involvement in vietnam had rendered the american flag as much a symbol of divisiveness as of unity . skelton , a soft - spoken , sentimental personality who ended every program with the invocation “ good night , and may god bless ,” added a coda to mr . lasswell ’ s explanation , a lamentation of the thought that the 1954 insertion of the words “ under god ” to the pledge of allegiance might someday cause it to be considered a “ prayer ” ( and thereby eliminated from public schools as well ), and given the recent appeals court ruling that teacher -

false	while there ’ s no doubt the 2016 election cycle has been one of the more unusual ones in recent history , perhaps the culmination of the parade of bizarre rumors about democratic candidate hillary clinton is that she was killed off in 1998 and is now represented by one of her many clones . <PARA> rumors have abounded that clinton ’ s health is failing , alongside the idea that she has every disease from subcortical vascular dementia to parkinson ’ s . these claims were bolstered by footage of clinton nearly collapsing while leaving a 11 september 2016 ceremony due to a pneumonia diagnosis , which also sparked a new round of death rumors . <PARA> but on 15 september 2016 , a blog called “ ascension with mother earth and current state of affairs ” took the weirdness to a whole new extreme by seemingly mashing all the rumors about clinton into one giant conglomeration : <PARA> for starters , there were no known instances of human cloning ( let alone advanced cloning that could result in a fully - mature adult in three days ), until 2008 , when scientists successfully cloned a human embryo . to date , there are no known cloned humans to have grown past the very early stages of gestation : <PARA> it ’ s rather subjective to claim that clones wouldn ’ t have “ souls ” considering a clone would be , in effect , a distinct living organism and also the idea of a soul is more theological than scientific . the problematic distinction of who has a soul and who does not can be seen in the the late 6th century european debate over whether or not women had souls . <PARA> to additionally claim the entire clinton family was wiped out or “ eliminated ” in 1998 is of course beyond the pale , as bill clinton was the sitting u . s . president until 2001 . hillary clinton has held high - profile political offices , both as a new york senator and secretary of state , since 1998 as well . the family has been continuously in the public eye and there is no sign that anything so catastrophic happened to them . moreover the claim that “ their entire memories transferred — and even stored on computers — then downloaded into replacement clones ” seems to be plagiarized from science fiction . <PARA> we couldn ’ t find anything credible pointing to the existence of grown human clones , let alone a stockpile of hillary replacement clones , nor could we find anything that indicates the entire clinton family was wiped out while president bill clinton was still in office — and no one noticed .
unproven	origins : no implement better visually identifies a physician than does the stethoscope , the acoustic medical device that enables medical personnel to listen to the internal sounds produced by the body . stethoscopes have been used by doctors since their invention in 1816 by french physician rene laennec ( 1781 - 1826 ), who on one momentous day in his office rolled a sheaf of paper into a tube and placed one end on his patient ’ s chest and his own ear at the other . <PARA> as dr . laennec described the incident in his writings , he “ rolled a quire of paper into a kind of cylinder and applied one end of it to the region of the heart and the other to my ear , and was not a little surprised and pleased to find that i could thereby perceive the action of the heart in a manner much more clear and distinct than i had ever been able to do by the immediate application of my ear .” <PARA> however , while the “ when ” and “ who ” of that creation are well known , there remains a bit of question as to the “ why .” <PARA> according to some tellings of the moment that inspired laennec to first conceive of using an implement to better listen to his patients ’ heart and lung sounds , it was the doctor ’ s own sense of modesty that drove him to the unusual act of placing something substantial between him and his patient . the person he was treating that day was a young woman , and according to some accounts , although she did present as having a heart problem and thus he did indeed need to listen to her cardiac function , the good doctor did not feel it proper to rest his head against her bosom . ( other physicians of the day got around this matter of seeming indelicacy by placing handkerchiefs on the chests of female patients , thus at least creating a symbolic barrier between their ears and the actual flesh of those they were examining .) <PARA> yet other accounts describe laennec ’ s inspiration as having to do with the woman ’ s size : he feared he would not be able to get a good aural reading of her chest function due to how well padded she was and thus cast about for something that might serve to amplify the sound . <PARA> whatever the cause of his inspiration , laennec took what he ’ d learned from that examination and set about building an instrument which would assist him in better <PARA> listening to heart sounds . his resulting “ stethoscope ” ( from the greek words stethos , meaning “ chest ,” and skopos , meaning “ observer ”) was a hollow wooden cylinder with a small funnel at one end . <PARA> while many authorities cite dr . arthur leared as the inventor in 1850 of the binaural ( two - earpiece ) stethoscope , that honor more properly belongs to dr . charles j . b . williams , who had in 1829 sketched the very same thing . in 1850 dr . george camman improved the existing design by substituting rubber tubing for materials previously used to transmit amplified chest sounds to the examining physician ’ s ears . few today would have difficulty in recognizing camman ’ s improved design as a stethoscope , as it looks very much like those used by doctors of the modern era . <PARA> modern stethoscopes range from inexpensive models that can be purchased for about $ 10 , which are useful for blood pressure readings but not that effective for listening to heart or lung sounds , up to ones that go for about $ 200 , which are favored by cardiologists who need to be able to distinguish every sound made by their patients ’ hearts . <PARA> barbara “ for the heart of hearing ” mikkelson
false	in february 2020 , numerous social media users were concerned about a potentially “ planet - killing ” asteroid that supposedly was expected to hit earth on the day after valentine ’ s day . as is typical for this type of “ armageddon ” rumor , fears about this doomsday event were overblown and largely based on fear - mongering headlines : <PARA> international business ( ibt ) times published an article headlined : “ largest planet - killer asteroid to approach earth this month arriving on saturday .” <PARA> the express claimed : “ nasa asteroid alert : radars track a 20 , 000mph space rock on ‘ close approach ’ this weekend .” <PARA> all of these articles are somewhat based in reality . nasa monitors the skies for neos ( near - earth objects ), and a large asteroid was indeed approaching earth in february 2020 . however , these articles led many people to believe their lives were in danger , and that the asteroid was expected to hit earth . but that simply isn ’ t the case . <PARA> while these articles spend time talking about what would happen if a large asteroid actually made impact with the earth ( complete with pictures of cinematic doomsday events ), they all concede in their concluding paragraphs that this asteroid ( asteroid 163373 or 2002 pz39 ) won ’ t come within 3 million miles of earth . <PARA> ibt writes ( emphasis ours ): “ according to [ nasa ’ s center for near - earth object studies ], 163373 ( 2002 pz39 )’ s near - earth intersection will happen on feb . 15 at 6 : 05 a . m . est . during this time , the asteroid will pass over the planet from a distance of 0 . 03860 astronomical units or around 3 . 6 million miles away .” <PARA> nasa confirmed this to us in a statement , writing : <PARA> “ the trajectory of asteroid 2002 pz39 is very well known . it will pass by earth at a distance of about 5 . 77 million kilometers ( approximately 3 . 59 million miles ). the asteroid will approach no closer than about 15 times the distance of the moon .” <PARA> the center for near - earth object studies ( cneos ) is constantly monitoring the skies for potentially dangerous asteroids . in fact , cneos currently lists about 20 asteroids that will pass safely by earth over the next month . only one , a relatively small asteroid with an estimated diameter of about of 50 meters called asteroid 2018 gy , is expected to come within 1 million miles of earth . <PARA> here ’ s a little more information about near - earth objects from cneos ( emphasis ours ): <PARA> this is hardly the first time we ’ ve received questions about a potential “ earth - killing ” asteroid . in fact , we ’ ve been investigating rumors about doomsday asteroids since at least 2015 . these fear - inducing reports have all come and gone without incident , and we expect that asteroid 2002 pz39 will do the same .

mixture	on 9 june 2016 , canada ’ s supreme court ruled that the language of the country ’ s current bestiality laws technically only banned sexual acts between human and non - human animals that involved penetration : <PARA> shortly after the ruling was issued , several web sites reported that canada had legalized oral sex with animals . the country , however , did not issue any new laws regarding bestiality , nor did they change any existing laws . the supreme court based their ruling on the legal definition of bestiality already in its criminal code : <PARA> however , this bill may not stand for much longer . legislation that would redefine bestiality to include all inter - species sexual activity was introduced to parliament , but as of june 2016 , remains in its early stages . camille labchuk , executive director of the animal justice group , urged lawmakers to quickly pass the bill : <PARA> whether or not the bill passes , bestiality has not been legalized in canada , and it ’ s extremely unlikely that it will ever be .
true	origins : the above - displayed picture comes from the fiesta de san fermín , a festival held every year between 6 july and 14 july in pamplona , spain , to commemorate san fermín , a 3rd - century saint who was martyred in being dragged <PARA> through the streets of pamplona by bulls . one of the highlights of the festival — and the event most well - known to the rest of the world ( due <PARA> in large part to its popularization through the writings of ernest hemingway ) — is the encierro , known in english as the “ running of the bulls .” <PARA> each day ’ s san fermín festivities include afternoon bullfights , and at 8 a . m . every morning the bulls to be used in that afternoon ’ s fights are set loose from a corral and herded about a half - mile through the cobbled streets of the town for a three - to four - minute run to the plaza de toros bullfighting stadium . many festival celebrants ( mostly young males ) choose to demonstrate their courage and physical prowess by donning white garb , tying red handkerchiefs about their necks , and running ahead of the group of charging bulls for as long as they can . others opt for somewhat safer ways to experience the thrill of participation : running only a very short portion of the course , running behind the bulls , standing in the street and ducking safely into doorways just as the bulls run past , or simply lining the streets for close - up views of the proceedings . <PARA> most years at least a few participants end up being gored or otherwise injured during the encierro ( at least thirteen people have been killed during the event since 1924 ), and 2007 was no exception . during what was described as “ the longest and bloodiest morning bull run ” during the festival , thirteen people , including a pair of american brothers ( 23 - year - old michael lenahan of philadelphia , pennsylvania , and 26 - year - old lawrence lenahan of hermosa beach , california ), were injured by bulls : <PARA> they were at a section of the run called “ deadman ’ s curve ,” where they let the pack of bulls pass them and started running behind them . <PARA> “ one bull unexpectedly broke from the pack ,” said lawrence . “ the next thing we knew , there was a bull charging us from behind , about ten feet [ away ]. they ’ re so fast .” <PARA> the angry , and no doubt frightened , animal gored both brothers . <PARA> lawrence suffered an eight - inch gash in his backside , while michael took a horn in his right leg , the horn entering on his shin and tearing through skin and tissue up to his knee . <PARA> “ it was total chaos for a minute or two ,” lawrence continued . “ my brother came yelling at me , and i was hollering at him . i saw that his leg was completely open . it was ripped open . you could see everything inside . and so we knew we had a problem ... i was eventually tackled and we were thrown in an ambulance .” <PARA> “ one bull unexpectedly broke from the pack ,” said lawrence . “ the next thing we knew , there was a bull charging us from behind , about ten feet [ away ]. they ’ re so fast .” <PARA> the angry , and no doubt frightened , animal gored both brothers . <PARA> lawrence suffered an eight - inch gash in his backside , while michael took a horn in his right leg , the horn entering on his shin and tearing through skin and tissue up to his knee . <PARA> “ it was total chaos for a minute or two ,” lawrence continued . “ my brother came yelling at me , and i was hollering at him . i saw that his leg was completely open . it was ripped open . you could see everything inside . and so we knew we had a problem ... i was eventually tackled and we were thrown in an ambulance .” <PARA> as shown in the above photograph , a 24 - year - old norwegian , christopher neiff , suffered a similar injury when a bull ’ s horn slid under his shin and tore the skin up to his knee .
false	on 21 july 2015 , united states citizenship and immigration services ( uscis ) issued a policy alert with the subject “ modifications to oath of allegiance for naturalization ” [ pdf ]. immediately , social media users and blogs declared the policy change a fundamental threat to american tradition , posting tweets ( examples of which are embedded above ) decrying the changes and circulating articles holding that president obama had removed “ a pledge to defend the usa ” from the oath : <PARA> louisiana gov . bobby jindal told breitbart that the policy update was “ ridiculous ,” and ( inaccurately ) claimed uscis was “ changing ” the oath : <PARA> some key details were lost in translation , however . while naturalized citizens are required to swear an oath that includes their promise to bear arms on behalf of the united states and to perform noncombatant service in the u . s . armed forces when required by law , existing policy already allowed new citizens to obtain waivers to delete or modify portions of the oath that conflicted with their deeply held beliefs or religious tenets ( including the bearing of arms or military service ). the policy update simply clarified the eligibility requirements for those religiously - based waivers ; it didn ’ t change the oath itself : <PARA> the “ oath of allegiance modifications and waivers ” policy page linked above explains that the standard of proof required for an applicant to obtain a waiver to the oath based upon religious or conscientious objection was already high : <PARA> the policy guidance indicates applicants are required to pass a “ three - part test ” during which time they have to explicitly establish the basis of their religious or conscientious objection to military service . moreover , no such waiver is allowable in scenarios involving objection to a specific war or conflict ( merely a broader belief held against the concept of war or bearing arms ): <PARA> the clause jindal and many social media users found so important was not one that dated to the american revolution or any far - flung point in history . in fact , it wasn ’ t a part of the oath until 1950 ( followed by a final update in 1952 pertaining to civilian conscription ): <PARA> so while the uscis clarified ( and expanded ) circumstances under which naturalization applicants may apply for a waiver to portions of the oath of allegiance pertaining to swearing to engage in armed defense of the united states , those who wish to obtain such a waiver are required to provide extensive proof of religious or conscientious objections . more important , the oath of allegiance for naturalization was not changed and will remain the same for newly naturalized individuals : the 21 july 2015 policy update issued by uscis simply clarified existing circumstances under which applicants could apply for a waiver to portions of the oath .

( some modern teachers would probably agree that maybe things haven ’ t changed so much since then after all .) <PARA> the bottom line is that nobody has ever been able to verify the authenticity of this list of rules . it has been reproduced in countless newspapers and books over the last fifty years , and copies of it have been displayed in numerous museums throughout north america , with each exhibitor claiming that it originated with their county or school district . it has also been also offered in a number of different guises , such as a list of rules for sales clerks at w . t . stewart ’ s department store in new york , for floor nurses in a hospital , and for the employees of a new england carriage works . <PARA> all attempts to trace this document to its origins inevitably dead end with a photocopy or printed sheet of indeterminate origin ( and suspiciously modern vintage ). <PARA> ( as a point of reference , we visited a historical site in our neighborhood which included a restored 19th century schoolhouse , complete with a preserved contemporaneous list of instructions for teachers . the items on that list were rather mundane , directing teachers to follow protocol by taking regular attendance , using the assigned texts , etc . nothing on the list involved manual labor or bore on the moral conduct of teachers ’ private lives .). <PARA> we are curious about why so many supposedly genuine reproductions of this document include a heading that mentions a specific year , such as “ rules for teachers — 1872 .” if these documents were genuine , why wouldn ’ t the headings simply read “ rules for teachers ”? did the rules change so frequently that including the year was necessary to avoid confusion ? do these documents represent an important revision to the “ rules for teachers — 1869 ′′ list ? <PARA> perhaps this piece tells us more about our contemporary vision of life in the 1870s than it does about life in the real 1870s .
false	did mitt romney actually say , “ i was too important to go to vietnam ”? there are many references to this online , but i have been <PARA> unable to confirm that it is true . <PARA> this stuff about mitt romney being a draft dodger seems false to me ... it ’ s circulating around the internet on social media sites : <PARA> monday , at a press event in california before the gop primary in that state , former gov . mitt romney was asked about his support of united states military involvement overseas . he was pleased to answer the question , however after his response , his answer to a follow - up question regarding his four deferments from the vietnam war did not please onlookers , especially veterans . <PARA> “ the vietnam war came at a time in my life when i had other plans . i knew in my heart of hearts that i would one day serve my nation . that i would one day hold an office that would help not only our nation , but also the world . so i did what i could to make sure that i would be around to serve my nation , as well as serving god by teaching very important religious principles to a broader audience overseas . my father did not want me serving , and he convinced me that yes , i was too important to go to vietnam . i had a greater purpose in life . i wasn ’ t neglecting my nation , but rather preparing myself for a future of service .” <PARA> [ rest of article here .] <PARA> origins : although republican presidential candidate mitt romney was of conscription age during the vietnam war , he neither was drafted for nor enlisted in the u . s . armed forces at that time . he received a total <PARA> of four draft deferments between 1965 and 1970 , three for academic studies ( i . e ., student deferments ) and one for serving as a ‘ minister of religion ’ while performing mormon missionary work in france . by the time his deferments ended , mitt romney ’ s birth date had been drawn at number 300 in the selective service lottery ; since the highest lottery number called for that group was 195 , romney was not drafted into the service . <PARA> although mitt romney was not a “ draft dodger ” ( all of his deferments were valid and legally obtained ), some critics have maintained that the contrast between his actively seeking deferments and his later statements about serving in vietnam is evidence of hypocrisy . <PARA> but regardless of whatever else he may have said on the subject , mitt romney never proclaimed that he was “ too important to go to vietnam .” that statement came from a fictitious bit of political humor which spoofed the issue of romney ’ s military service and was published in june 2012 by the free wood post , a satirical web site which states in its disclaimer that : <PARA> free wood post is a news and political satire web publication , which may or may not use real names , often in semi - real or mostly fictitious ways . all news articles contained within freewoodpost . com are fiction , and presumably fake news . <PARA> any resemblance to the truth is purely coincidental , except for all references to politicians and / or celebrities , in which case they are based on real people , but still based almost entirely in fiction . <PARA> freewoodpost . com is intended for a mature , sophisticated , and discerning audience . <PARA> any resemblance to the truth is purely coincidental , except for all references to politicians and / or celebrities , in which case they are based on real people , but still based almost entirely in fiction . <PARA> freewoodpost . com is intended for a mature , sophisticated , and discerning audience .
mixture	in august 2016 , multiple reports emerged that ann scott , the wife of florida governor rick scott , either owned a mosquito spraying company outright , or owned a major stake in one . the rumor has added fuel to emerging conspiracy theories that zika is either a hoax , or that it was purposely introduced into the united states to distract from national politics . <PARA> however , the zika virus is not only real , but it is making inroads into the united states ( and beyond ) as travelers bearing the disease arrive within its borders , despite safety warnings . zika is just one of the millions of viruses and bacteria that mutate and can quickly spread , potentially bringing a pandemic to the world on the level of the bubonic plague , or , more recently , the 1918 influenza outbreak . <PARA> diseases can appear or mutate seemingly out of nowhere , and technological advances can bring about unforeseen consequences , as researcher and writer laurie garrett detailed in her 1994 book , the coming plague . in one chapter , garrett writes about an outbreak of a mysterious disease that sickened more than 200 attendees of the 1976 american legion convention at the bellevue - stratford hotel in philadelphia , pennsylvania , eventually killing 25 people . it was dubbed the “ philly killer ” at first , then legionnaire ’ s disease — and traced back to bacteria breeding in the hotel ’ s air conditioning system : <PARA> that unease has persisted as the world has become far more interconnected and travel has become much more commonplace within a single generation . in the case of zika , the virus is spread by mosquitos . although it was first detected in 1947 , the disease didn ’ t become a global issue until 2015 . according to dr . amy vittor of the university of florida , the modern world has created a fertile breeding ground for zika ( and other mosquito - borne pathogens ) to thrive : <PARA> in other words , if it ’ s not zika , there will be something else waiting in the wings , and to work in public health is to constantly be aware of potential pandemics . as cynical as it may sound , the upswing in insect - borne illnesses like zika means there ’ s money in mosquito eradication — a lot of it . the financial industry , always looking for the next place to invest , naturally landed on pest control , an industry that has shown “ substantial growth ” since 2014 : <PARA> that means that investment companies will show pest control services in their portfolios . according to a 17 august 2016 article in floridabulldog . org , an independent nonprofit news organization that covers the state , ann scott has a large financial stake in a pest control company out of louisiana (“ mosquito control services llc ”) through a private investment firm that she co - owns : <PARA> the rumors bear a striking similarity to a story about the scotts owning ( or having a financial interest in ) a drug - testing company , which came to light at the same time that the state decided to test the urine of welfare recipients and state workers , at their own expense : <PARA> while the ethical considerations of the scotts owning any financial stake in either solantic or mcs ( and the strong , but mysteriously obscure links they have to the investment firm ) is a topic that would perhaps benefit from much more discussion and transparency , it is inaccurate to say that ann scott outright owns a zika mosquito spraying company , as some headlines would have you believe — or that zika is either a hoax or a conspiracy . <PARA> its appearance in the united states ’ national consciousness , much like ebola ’ s in 2014 , can be attributed to a strong and media - savvy public health sector trying to raise awareness and alarms before a problematic but still relatively rare disease ( which has been linked to everything from microcephaly and other congenital brain abnormalities to guillain - barré syndrome ) becomes an outright , explosive pandemic .
false	in january 2016 , a piece began circulating on social media holding that a 17 - year - old christian boy had stood his ground in a scheels ( not “ shield ’ s ”) sporting goods and entertainment chain store outlet in st . cloud , minnesota , when he was allegedly asked to cover his “ offensive ” cross by a hijab - clad muslim cashier : <PARA> this narrative bore a striking similarity to a prolific urban legend about a similarly angry hijab - wearing cashier and a customer with a flag pin , various versions of which circulated as early as 2003 . <PARA> we attempted to locate a “ shield ’ s ” store in the area of st . cloud , minnesota , but found only a retailer of similar description called “ scheels .” we contacted the scheels location in question and spoke with a manager , who immediately recognized the rumor to which we were referring . he maintained that the narrative was completely fabricated and advised us that prior to the “ shield ’ s ” version of the story , the same story had been attached to a local walmart . <PARA> the st . cloud times also published a fact check article which referenced an “ alleged incident at a st . cloud wal - mart that [ had ] been widely shared ” on facebook , noting that : <PARA> the st . cloud times contacted both st . cloud - area walmarts and eventually made contact with walmart spokesman kory lundberg . lundberg told the newspaper that the chain had learned of and investigated the claim but ultimately deemed it unfounded : <PARA> we also contacted walmart to inquire whether any further information about the rumor had emerged but did not receive a reply by publication time .

false	origins : a rumor began circulating on social media in february 2015 claiming that instagram had “ banned jesus ,” as evidenced by many users ’ discovering that posting the phrase “ i am a born again follower of jesus ” to the comments attached to photographs resulted in the display of a community guidelines violation warning : <PARA> although it is correct that instagram blocks users from adding the phrase “ i am a born again follower of jesus ” to the comments of a post , this phenomenon has nothing to do with jesus or religion . the reason this comment violates instagram ’ s community guidelines is because it includes letters <PARA> spelling out the term “ gain follower .” instagram users also can ’ t comment that they are “ born again followers of grilled cheese ” or “ born again followers of the chicago bulls .” <PARA> instagram has marked the phrase “ gain follower ,” as well as variations of the term , as a spam technique intended to boost users ’ popularity . while this prevents people on instagram from overtly begging for more followers , it has also inadvertently stopped a few people from proclaiming that they are “ born again followers of jesus .” <PARA> instagram could refine this ban in the future in order to prevent the phrase “ born again ” from being inadvertently classified as spam . in the meantime , there are a few workarounds : since the word “ jesus ” is not banned on instagram , users can write something similar to “ i am born again . i love jesus ” or replace the “ o ” s in “ i am a born again follower of jesus ” with “ 0 ” s :

mixture	on 2 october 2018 , journalist jamal khashoggi disappeared during a visit to saudi arabia ’ s consulate in instanbul , turkey . although foul play was suspected , the saudi government at first denied that any harm had been done to the journalist . then they began releasing conflicting accounts , beginning with the claim that khashoggi died accidentally in a “ fistfight .” <PARA> ultimately , the saudis acknowledged that evidence provided by turkish investigators pointed to his being slain in a “ premeditated ” attack , which they said was undertaken in a “ rogue operation ” not authorized by the saudi royal family . two senior government officials were dismissed , and 18 saudi nationals allegedly involved in the murder were arrested . <PARA> president trump was criticized in the immediate aftermath of khashoggi ’ s disappearance for his apparent reluctance to hold the saudis responsible for the incident . “ we want to find out what happened ,” he said . but he also maintained that the united states ’ relations with the kingdom were “ excellent ” and he would not consider stopping arms sales to saudi arabia despite calls from members of congress to do so . <PARA> various commentators , including washington post contributor brian klaas , suggested that trump ’ s official dealings with saudi arabia are “ compromised by deep financial conflicts of interest ”: <PARA> trump responded by tweeting that he has no financial interests in saudi arabia : <PARA> that same day , fox news research ( a fox news twitter account that regularly posts newsworthy data ) tweeted a list highlighting some of trump ’ s business relationships with the saudis : <PARA> shortly afterward , trump ’ s tweet and the fox news tweet were combined into a meme and unleashed on facebook : <PARA> the meme presented the fox news tweet as a refutation of trump ’ s , but although each of the former ’ s statements can be confirmed via reliable sources , they don ’ t necessarily disprove president trump ’ s claim that he has no financial interests in saudi arabia . <PARA> the sticking point ( and the reason we ’ re rating the claim a mixture of true and false ) is that the term “ financial interests ” usually denotes the ownership of property or investments in a given place , company , or industry . we have found no evidence that either trump or trump organization ( the umbrella company operated by trump ’ s sons , donald jr . and eric ), currently owns property or investments in saudi arabia . <PARA> according to federal election commission ( fec ) filings , the trump organization was pursuing plans to open businesses in saudi arabia as recently as 2016 , but the associated press reported in october 2018 that the companies had been shut down by the time trump took office : <PARA> there is no question that trump has profited from business dealings with the saudis , however . let ’ s take the items in the fox news research list one by one : <PARA> fortune reported in 2017 that trump , facing financial difficulties in 1991 , sold a yacht he purchased from the sultan of brunei in the 1980s to saudi arabia ’ s prince al - waleed bin talal . <PARA> the associated press reported that the kingdom of saudi purchased the entire 45th floor of trump world tower in new york city in 2001 , “ the biggest purchase in that building to that point .” <PARA> during a 16 june 2015 speech at trump tower announcing his presidential candidacy , trump said : “ saudi arabia , they make $ 1 billion a day . $ 1 billion a day . i love the saudis . many are in this building .” at a campaign rally one month later , he said : “ i like the saudis ; they are very nice . i make a lot of money with them . they buy all sorts of my stuff — all kinds of toys from trump . they pay me millions and hundreds of millions .” <PARA> at a campaign rally in mobile , alabama in august 2015 , trump said : “ saudi arabia , i get along with all of them . they buy apartments from me . they spend $ 40 million , $ 50 million . am i supposed to dislike them ? i like them very much .” <PARA> the wall street journal reported in june 2017 that trump international hotel washington , d . c ., received payments amounting to roughly $ 270 , 000 for services provided to lobbyists working for the saudi government . although trump had announced earlier in the year that any trump organization profits from foreign governments would be donated to the u . s . treasury , the company did not respond to the journal ‘ s questions about what would be done with the saudi payments , which were made through a third party . <PARA> despite his not owning businesses , properties , or investments in the kingdom of saudi arabia , trump has clearly , and by his own admission , profited to the tune of tens of millions of dollars from business dealings with the saudis , and over a long period of time . <PARA> we reached out to the trump organization for comment but received no reply .
false	note : the family of the boy was well paid and beat poverty by accident . the guy playing the guitar in deliverance is ronnie cox . <PARA> this is an excerpt of the film “ deliverance ”. when the filming group of the movie stopped at a gas station somewhere , one of the actors started to play a tune of the film on his guitar . <PARA> an autistic boy was watching the filming at the gas station and heard the music . <PARA> he started to respond with notes from his banjo . this started an incredible dialogue of instruments and the autistic boy expressed himself in probably the only form in which he was prepared to communicate . <PARA> this is how this remarkable scene , ‘ that was included in the movie ’, was developed and filmed . <PARA> look at the expression of the boy . at first , he seems uncertain and waiting but as the intensity of the music progressed , his lost expression was gone and an expression of pleasure and happiness was recovered , thanks to this guitar player ( ronnie cox ) who happened to pass by . <PARA> after this magic moment passed , the boy returned into himself leaving this part of his externalized beauty in the film ... a truly memorable part of the movie . <PARA> watch the little boy especially at the end . <PARA> origins : the violence and depiction of male rape in the 1972 film deliverance were not the only disturbing elements in that cinematic offering . set in the rural south , the film presents the inhabitants of that area as inbred , mentally - backward , dangerous creatures capable in their animalistic <PARA> simplicity of anything . the boy encountered early in the film by the urban foursome is cut from this cloth : with pale , flat eyes and stony face , he gazes upon the interlopers impassively . while he is momentarily drawn from his aloofness by the friendly musical competition he becomes caught up in , at the end he recoils from the offer of a handshake , reacting far more like a wary animal that has been cornered than a human being . <PARA> the item quoted above , which began circulating in january 2011 , offers an explanation for the inclusion of the “ dueling banjos ” scene different from its actual purpose of setting the tone for the film . according to its lights , the musical exchange was unplanned and unscripted , the result of an accidental encounter between one of the actors and a mentally disadvantaged local boy , fortuitously caught by a cameraman . <PARA> which is hogwash . <PARA> musicians eric weissberg and steve mandell arranged and performed “ dueling banjos ” on the deliverance soundtrack . this call - and - response piece audiences now know as “ dueling banjos ” is a bluegrass classic “ feudin ’ banjos ,” which was composed in 1955 by arthur “ guitar boogie ” smith . <PARA> the banjo - playing boy in the film was portrayed by billy redden , then an 15 - year - old georgia student . the lad was hired for the role because he fit the visual image many have of a mentally - deficient youngster and so would wordlessly communicate to the film ’ s audience the stereotype discussed above . he was neither slow - witted nor autistic . he also could not play the banjo . ( some camera trickery and the use of a double combined to make it appear otherwise ). redden , who currently works as a cook and dishwasher at a restaurant in dillard , georgia , has since appeared in three other films : blastfighter ( 1984 ), big fish ( 2003 ), and outrage ( 2009 ). <PARA> barbara “ script kiddie ” mikkelson

mixture	when we human folk exchange information about each other , age is one of the most important pieces of data we pass along . knowing someone ’ s age immediately allows us to infer a great deal of information about that person with a reasonable degree of certainty : age not only tells us whether someone is a child , an adult , or an elderly person , but it allows us to place people into much finer gradations of categories — infant , toddler , child , adolescent , young adult , adult , middle - aged , elderly — from which we can deduce a good deal about their physical , psychological , and social statuses . <PARA> we know a 4 - year - old child should be walking , but a 6 - month - old baby is unlikely to be capable of the feat . we understand a couple of 16 - year - olds might well have a baby together , but an 8 - year - old boy is generally too young to father one and a 58 - year - old woman is usually too old to conceive one . we ’ re aware most 9 - year - olds haven ’ t yet reached puberty , but a 39 - year - old might well have started experiencing many of the infirmities of advanced age ( e . g ., lessened eyesight , loss of hearing , weight gain , persistent aches and pains ). we grasp that a 29 - year - old is in what we would term “ the prime of life ,” while an 89 - year - old has well exceeded the average human lifespan . we can make pretty good guesses from a person ’ s age about whether he ’ s old enough to have finished his schooling , live away from his parents , be married , or hold an important professional position , or whether he ’ s too old to still be working or raising children of his own . and even those of us who still have most of our lives ahead of us know all this . <PARA> when it comes to our pets , however , many of us are mystified how to relate their ages to ours . sure , knowledgeable owners and breeders may be quite familiar with all the developmental stages of their chosen animals , but many of us casual pet owners can ’ t do much more than distinguish between “ puppy ,” “ dog ,” and “ old dog .” at what age are kittens weaned from their mothers ? what ’ s the average lifespan of a dog ? when is a cat old enough to reproduce , and when is a dog too old to bear a litter ? is an 8 - year - old dog in the prime of life , or is he closer to middle age ? lacking a good deal of observational experience , many of us simply don ’ t know . <PARA> since knowledge and experience take time and effort to acquire , we ’ ve developed simple shortcuts to help us answer these questions , such as the well - known formula for “ dog years ”: multiply your dog ’ s age by seven , and you ’ ll have his equivalent age in human terms . although this formula might work roughly well for the middle years of a dog ’ s life , it ’ s too simplistic to accurately reflect a dog ’ s developmental status closer to either end of its lifespan . using this calculation , for example , an 18 - month - old dog would be at a developmental stage similar to a 10 - year - old child ’ s , but while many 18 - month - old dogs are fully grown and capable of reproducing , few 10 - year - old children are . the “ dog years ” measurement tells us a 15 - year - old dog is supposed to be the equivalent of a 105 - year - old person , but ( factoring out accidents and other unnatural causes of death ) a much larger proportion of dogs live to the age of 15 than humans live to the age of 105 . <PARA> as well , age is more than just a chronological measurement of years lived ; it ’ s also an expression of how our bodies have been affected by the passage of time . different types of animals age at different rates , so we can ’ t employ a simple , direct , proportional relationship to correlate the ages of species as disparate as dogs and humans , especially since variable factors such as genetics , nutrition , and environment play an important role in the aging process . the bottom line is just as we wouldn ’ t raise a litter of puppies or kittens the same way we ’ d raise a baby , neither should we care for our pets based on how old we think they ’ d be if they were people . <PARA> for those who would like a rough idea of how the ages of our canine and feline friends compare to ours ( strictly for entertainment purposes ), we present the following charts courtesy of antech : <PARA> however , smaller dog breeds tend to live longer on average than larger breeds , so no single chart can adequately represent all dogs with much accuracy . therefore a better charting of equivalent ages is one based on the weight of the animal :

true	origins : we generally expect texts produced by legislatures and courts and other governmental agencies to be stodgy , prolix , and incomprehensible , so finding one one that is short and simple and even a bit whimsical is a welcome source of amusement . we recently came across an example of such in a bill submitted to the minnesota legislature ( h . f . 224 ) in january 2007 for the purpose of establishing the position of a state poet laureate . the main text of the bill is a mere twenty - four lines , written entirely in rhyming verse : <PARA> section 1 .

true	in march 2003 , iraq was invaded by a u . s .- led coalition of forces mobilized by the george w . bush administration on the grounds that saddam hussein ’ s regime posed an imminent threat to world peace and stability . a large number of americans remained unpersuaded by president bush ’ s justification for going to war , however , and thus his decision to do so was criticized before , during , and after the invasion took place . <PARA> reflecting the growing political divide in the country , another segment of the american populace held that it was unpatriotic or even treasonous to speak out against someone who was leading the united states in a time of war . critics fired back that far from being unpatriotic , it is one ’ s patriotic duty to oppose a president whose policies put americans in harm ’ s way for no defensible reason . one way they attempted to claim the higher moral ground was by citing a quote attributed to the 26th u . s . president , theodore roosevelt : <PARA> the passage is , in fact , from an editorial written by the former president in may 1918 , when the u . s . was embroiled in world war i . make no mistake , roosevelt wasn ’ t against the war — quite to the contrary , he believed the u . s . had entered it too reluctantly — but he was outspokenly critical of president woodrow wilson ’ s conduct of the war , writing no fewer than two syndicated editorials a week over a two - year period advocating for a stronger u . s . presence on the european war front . <PARA> roosevelt ’ s criticisms led to accusations of “ disloyalty ” on his part , and worse . ralph stout , managing editor of the kansas city star , took note of the vehemence the attacks on roosevelt : <PARA> it was comments like these , exacerbated by suggestions from elements within the wilson administration that roosevelt ’ s views ought somehow to be suppressed , that prompted him to craft this high - minded rebuttal : <PARA> nearly 100 years after this , the passage was used to defend critics not only of president george w . bush , but of president barack obama and president - elect donald trump , as well .
false	republican presidential frontrunner donald trump has been on the campaign trail for months , and many of his political rallies have been characterized by controversy and and sometimes violent demonstrations ( both for and against him ). on 24 may 2016 , in albuquerque , new mexico , hundreds of anti - trump protestors swarmed the streets in front of its convention center , banging on windows and lighting trash and shirts on fire . <PARA> dramatic photographs and videos emerged from the rally : <PARA> the image that arguably evoked the most outrage from the rest of the country , however , was one of a horse that had fallen in the street : <PARA> that photograph first made the rounds with the correct description — that a police horse had fallen in the street suffering abrasions — but the description of the horse ’ s injury quickly mutated ( from scrapes to a fractured leg to death ), as did the location of the protest ( after another rally on 25 may , this one in anaheim , that city became the rumored place in which the rumored violence took place ). <PARA> however , the photograph came from albuquerque , and the horse ’ s leg wasn ’ t fractured , nor did it suffer major injuries . it ’ s also unclear why the horse fell . the albuquerque journal reported that the horse “ slipped ,” but didn ’ t say that it was specifically because of the protestors shoving or hurting it : <PARA> other outlets reported that the horse had suffered abrasions , but the rumors continued . the albuquerque police department finally put the issue to rest on twitter : <PARA> the next day , the apd put up follow - up photographs : <PARA> and stryker and the characteristic white star on his forehead appeared in the background of a press conference that was broadcast by the albuquerque police department on periscope on 26 may 2016 : <PARA> protesters did throw rocks and bottles at the mounted police ( and spooked their horses ), but stryker the police horse did not break his leg ( in either albuquerque or anaheim ) and was not killed . <PARA> the albuquerque police department ’ s public information officer , tanner tixier , told us that had something happened to one of their seven mounts , the department would acknowledge it :

unproven	after the 2016 u . s . general election wound down , stories of a more dangerous united states began popping up on social media . according to one such story , gay canadian film producer chris ball was badly beaten outside a bar in santa monica , california , by several donald trump supporters who had been emboldened by the vote ’ s outcome . <PARA> the web site usuncut reported on the claim and shared moderately graphic facebook screenshots documenting the aftermath of the purported attack : <PARA> according to that article , the incident took place on 8 november 2016 , the night of the election . the next day , facebook user k . c . macpherson shared one of the images and wrote : <PARA> little information was provided about the circumstances leading up to the bar fight , although earlier reporting quoted ball as saying the images made his injuries seem worse than they actually were : <PARA> that account provided a version of events that was not so clearly partisan , with bar patrons engaging , as they sometimes do , in heated rhetoric . ball said he left the establishment alone and claims he was jumped by a group of men , but not necessarily anyone who had followed him outside from the bar . <PARA> it is possible that the men who purportedly attacked chris ball were trump supporters emboldened by the candidate ’ s win . however , trump supporters might point to images captured just before the election as counter - evidence : <PARA> on 10 november 2016 , the santa monica police department published a post to their facebook page casting further doubt on ball ’ s story : <PARA> none of the reports we found about chris ball ’ s altercation with purported trump supporters mentioned a location , cited a police report , or any provided information substantiating his attackers ’ motives . the account could have been completely accurate , but the event it described also could have been a garden - variety bar fight that took place after what turned out to be an exceptionally tense night in the united states .
mixture	in mid - november 2009 , a brief associated press news account reported an incident that had taken place on an airtran airways flight from atlanta to houston , one which resulted in the plane ’ s returning to the gate and departing 21 ⁄ 2 hours late due to a passenger who would not shut off his cell phone when so directed by a flight attendant . <PARA> a fuller article published by the atlanta journal - constitution , who interviewed a woman seated directly behind the passenger in question , provided more detail : the passenger with the cell phone was part of a larger group ( eleven others , plus an interpreter ) seated throughout the plane ; the passenger and the interpreter were asked to step off the plane ( the other eleven members of the group also left the plane , although they eventually reboarded the same flight , while the passenger and the interpreter took a later flight ); twelve other passengers also took up the airline ’ s offer to allow them to leave the plane and take a different flight ; and a new crew eventually manned the flight when it finally departed . <PARA> an airtran spokesman said the issue was a simple matter of a passenger who would not turn off his cell phone when directed ( a situation complicated by the passenger ’ s inability to speak english ), requiring the flight to return to the gate : <PARA> although the incident was reported to the federal aviation administration ( faa ), the transportation security administration ( tsa ) said it would not follow up , as it was a customer service issue and not a security issue : <PARA> the woman on the flight who was interviewed by the journal - constitution maintained that the passenger in question had a camera , not a cell phone , and that the incident was merely one of confusion involving a non - english speaking passenger which was blown out of proportion due to “ poor communication ”: <PARA> shortly after these events , a widely circulated account of the incident appeared on the internet from todd petruna , who maintained that he was a passenger on the referenced flight and that what really took place was quite different than what was reported in the news . according to petruna , muslim passengers on the flight were potential terrorists who were making a “ dry run ” at hijacking an airliner : <PARA> in anther account , a chaplain who was originally slated to fly on flight 297 ( but had arrived late and missed the initial boarding ) reported that another passenger who left the plane before its eventual take - off told him that , as stated in todd petruna ’ s message , the incident involved more than the single passenger mentioned by airtran representatives and news reports : <PARA> however , none of the news accounts of the flight 297 incident mentioned members of a passenger group screaming insults at the flight crew or being bodily ejected from the plane by other passengers . on 4 december 2009 , airtran issued a point - by - point rebuttal of the original account , maintaining ( among other statements ) that the members of the group in question were dressed just like other passengers ( rather than in “ muslim attire ”), that there were no reports of their screaming insults at crew members , that there were no reports of any of them standing up in a threatening manner , that there were no physical altercations between any passengers , that the group ’ s bags were not removed from the plane , that none of the group members was determined to pose a security threat , that there was no tsa agent on the plane , and that no passenger was refused permission to get off the plane : <PARA> airtran also issued a statement maintaining that todd petruna not actually a passenger on flight 297 : <PARA> according to a marietta daily journal reporter and houston station khou - tv , the e - mail ’ s author acknowledged he had embellished his account but maintained that he was in fact on the flight : <PARA> another flight 297 passenger interviewed <!– in a video made available –> by atlanta television station wsb stated that although he did see a number of middle eastern passengers on the flight walking around , interacting with each other , and being uncooperative with the flight crew , and although he felt airtran mishandled the incident ( primarily by not communicating information about the situation to other passengers ), none of the group in question was dancing , singing , taking pictures , or ended up being manhandled off the airplane by other passengers . he also stated that he talked to the pilots on the replacement crew , who reported they felt perfectly safe in flying the plane , and that he thought the claim the group of middle easterners were potential hijackers or terrorists to be “ far - fetched .” <PARA> ( contrary to common belief , the fact that a replacement crew was used to complete the flight is not an indicator that the original flight crew refused to continue or felt the situation to be unsafe . when flights experience substantial delays in taking off , as flight 297 did that day , that situation sometimes requires that the original crew be replaced because otherwise they would “ time out ” and exceed faa limitations on maximum hours per working period .)
true	on july 29 , 2019 , a video supposedly showing several seesaws installed across the border wall between mexico and the united states went viral on social media : <PARA> this is a genuine video of seesaws installed through slats in the border wall in new mexico . however , this was not a permanent installation . as of this writing , the seesaws are no longer there . <PARA> california professors ronald rael and virginia san fratello first came up with the idea of border seesaws while exploring alternatives to a traditional border wall in 2009 . rael and fratello brought the project to life in july 2019 with the help of a group of artists in juarez , mexico . <PARA> rael posted several photographs and videos of the “ teetertotter wall ” to his instagram page , along with a message explaining the idea behind the project : <PARA> while the viral video truly shows a seesaw installed along the u . s .- mexico border , this international playground was only up for about a day . a customs and border patrol official told heather leighton of forbes that “ there is no playground along the u . s .- mexico border ”:

false	a young couple with their baby were traveling on i - 77 when a car of 4 black males came up beside them on the interstate and started waving a gun at them for them to stop . they kept going and the car followed them for 20 miles waving the gun and harassing them . at approximately mile marker 47 they saw a highway patrolman and flashed their lights at him , the patrolman pulled out behind them ; unfortunately at the 48 mile marker the couple slammed on brakes and lost control of the car having a terrible accident . wayne said it didn ’ t look as if anyone got seriously hurt – they were just very scared . <PARA> wayne talked to the highway patrolman who told them that this is a gang initiation thing coming out of charlotte . if you stop , they shoot you – and if you don ’ t stop , they continue to attempt to get you to stop . they have been unable to catch these people “ in the act ” – just getting the reports afterwards . <PARA> thankfully , this couple and their baby were okay . i made sure i passed this on to my kids - pass it on to your friends and family as well . i cannot imagine how scared this couple must have been . <PARA> origins : this e - mailed warning about a purported gang initiation by murder of a random victim in south carolina began arriving in the snopes . com inbox in march 2007 . although something like the incident described did occur , the charlotte - mecklenburg police department told us that it apparently was a case of spur - of - the - moment “ road rage ,” rather than a premeditated action : <PARA> e - mails are beginning to circulate about an incident that occurred last week on interstate 77 in south carolina . the e - mails state a family was traveling on i - 77 when a vehicle containing 4 males pulled next to them , displayed a gun and motioned for them to pull over . both vehicles continued until the driver of the victim ’ s vehicle lost control and was involved in a single vehicle collision . the e - mails also state a tow truck operator who responded to the accident was told by a deputy in fairfield county that this was a gang initiation coming out of charlotte . according to one e - mail the deputy further stated , “ if you stop , they shoot you – and if you don ’ t stop , they continue to attempt to get you to stop .” <PARA> i contacted first sergeant guempel of the sc highway patrol . he responded to the scene of the accident and has been contacted by other agencies about the possible gang activity . he indicated this incident was a case of “ road rage ” and there was no indication it was related to gang activity . he also said the victim initiated the incident after coming up behind the suspect vehicle on the interstate and flashing his high beam lights . it is unclear as to whether a weapon was displayed , and the race of the occupants of the suspect vehicle is also in question . the suspect vehicle was described as a green mustang , but was never located . <PARA> while the accident did occur , it appears the facts have been embellished . <PARA> i contacted first sergeant guempel of the sc highway patrol . he responded to the scene of the accident and has been contacted by other agencies about the possible gang activity . he indicated this incident was a case of “ road rage ” and there was no indication it was related to gang activity . he also said the victim initiated the incident after coming up behind the suspect vehicle on the interstate and flashing his high beam lights . it is unclear as to whether a weapon was displayed , and the race of the occupants of the suspect vehicle is also in question . the suspect vehicle was described as a green mustang , but was never located . <PARA> while the accident did occur , it appears the facts have been embellished . <PARA> the story ’ s “ gang initiation by murder of randomly - chosen victim ” premise is the theme of a number of scares documented on this site , all of them baseless ( e . g ., drivers who flash their headlights at a darkened car ( as a way of alerting those being flashed at that their vehicle ’ s headlights are not on ), motorists lured into pulling off to the side of the road by gangbangers who flash their headlights at him ( as a way of indicating there ’ s something wrong with the targeted victims ’ vehicles ), women refueling their vehicles at gas stations having prospective <PARA> gang members hide themselves in their cars so as to kidnap , rape and murder the women when they get back in and drive off , and women and children in wal - mart parking lots being picked off as they leave or make their way back to their vehicles ). <PARA> south carolina is in the throes of recognizing it has an escalating gang problem , and some folks in that area are only now starting to shake off their “ we ’ re too rural for that to happen here ” mentality and wake up to what has been going on around them . while gangs of various stripe have been growing in number and membership in that region for some time , only recently has their presence come to be viewed as anything other than restricted to isolated pockets of activity . <PARA> but that is changing . of this awakening . said the charleston post and courier in february 2007 : <PARA> police departments are forming specialized gang units . lawmakers are working to institute tougher penalties for gang members . communities are meeting to discuss the threat . and officials are assembling a statewide computer database to track identified gang members ... just three years ago , the state law enforcement division had identified 84 groups in south carolina that fit the general definition of a gang : an organized group of three or more people who adopt a common name and engage in crime . that figure has since ballooned to 325 identified gangs , with a combined membership of more than 1 , 600 people , sled chief robert stewart said . <PARA> part of that awakening process may well be the spread of wild tales about ruthless gangs that induct new members by having them murder victims chosen on a whim . <PARA> yet the murder of haphazardly - chosen victims isn ’ t a common gang induction ritual , in south carolina or elsewhere in the u . s . while each troop has its own rites of passage , the usual mode of induction remains being “ jumped in ” — that is , initiates are beaten by full - fledged gang members for a specified length of time , with recruits who withstand the battering being admitted to the gang . <PARA> there have been instances of initiations into street gangs that led to the murder of random victims , but they are rare . generally , they don ’ t involve gang hopefuls being clearly commanded by their overlords to take the lives of the haphazardly - selected but are rather instances of killings that occur incidentally during the course of criminal tasks that prospective initiates had been sent to accomplish by their <PARA> handlers . <PARA> for instance , as part of his initiation into the bloods in december 2004 in harford county , maryland , 18 - year - old wayne lavon bond , jr . and 21 - year - old darrell levon miller were ordered by their superiors to summon a cab to a remote location and rob its driver . while it is not clear from a reading of news accounts whether either of the pair had been ordered to murder the man they were to rob , after getting in the taxi with the cabdriver , 37 - year - old derald howard guess , and relieving him of $ 20 , bond shot guess once in the temple , killing him . bond was sentenced to life plus 60 years . in return for his testimony against bond , miller was sentenced to life in prison with all but 45 years of his term suspended . <PARA> similarly , in february 2004 in new york , when 18 - year - old charles ( c - murder ) bryant expressed interest in joining a bloods faction called the gun squad , he was told he would have to rob the chinese food deliveryman then on the way to the apartment with an order . the robbery of 18 - year - old huang chen by bryant , 19 - year - old nayquan miller , and 19 - year - old william ( hitz ) capehart quickly turned into a savage assault on the food deliverer , who was beaten to death with a hammer . bryant received a sentence of 51 - 1 / 3 years for the crime , and capehart received a 50 + years sentence . in return for his testimony against the others , miller was given a reduced prison term of 20 years to life . <PARA> however , there has been at least one documented case of initiation into a gang being effected by way of the murder of randomly - selected strangers . on 17 august 1998 , tracy lambert and susan moore were abducted by prospective crips (“ baby gangsters ” or “ bgs ”) in linden , north carolina , forced into the trunk of moore ’ s car , driven to a field outside town , and executed by being shot in the head . earlier that evening , debra cheeseborough had been similarly abducted by the group and forced into the trunk of her car , taken to smith lake on fort bragg , and shot seven times in the back . cheeseborough was left for dead but survived to testify against her abductors . <PARA> the two gang leaders who ordered the abductions , francisco tirado and eric devon queen , were found guilty of all charges against them , including first - degree murder , burglary , kidnapping , robbery with a dangerous weapon , conspiracy , attempted first - degree murder , and assault with intent to kill , inflicting serious injury . queen told police he shot lambert in the head while the others watched . eventually , all nine participants in the murders were charged and convicted . <PARA> barbara “ gang planked ” mikkelson
false	the phrase “ life is hard ; it ’ s harder when you ’ re stupid ” ( also variously rendered as “ life is hard ; it ’ s even harder when you ’ re stupid ” or “ life is tough , but it ’ s tougher when you ’ re stupid ”) has long been a favorite of memists , nearly all of whom attribute the saying to iconic western film actor john wayne . it sounds like something the blunt - speaking duke would have said , and that ’ s sufficient for most people . but john wayne didn ’ t actually say this , either as a line of character dialogue in a film or speaking as himself . <PARA> this line has been claimed of various characters played by wayne in a number of movies , most commonly the 1949 release sands of iwo jima , in which wayne portrayed the battle - hardened marine sergeant john m . stryker — the imdb even listed this saying as one of the film ’ s memorable quotes . but no character in sands of iwo jima , sgt . stryker or otherwise , speaks such a line . and no one has yet turned up a film clip or script documenting the phrase as something spoken by a wayne character in any other movie . <PARA> so where did the phrase come from ? is it yet another great saying thought up by that witty sage , anonymous ? <PARA> the earliest known cinematic use of this thought ( whatever its precise expression ) appears in the 1973 crime film the friends of eddie coyle , which was in turn based on the 1970 novel of the same name by george v . higgins . the book ’ s title character is an aging small - time criminal and informant who works as a gun runner in boston ’ s irish - american underworld , but it is another character , the young gun runner jackie brown , who ends up saying , “ this life ’ s hard , but it ’ s harder if you ’ re stupid .” that line comes through almost intact in the film version , rendered by actor steven keats ( playing jackie brown ) as “ this life ’ s hard , man , but it ’ s harder if you ’ re stupid ”: <PARA> the movie was promoted in print ads using a tag line of “ life is tough , but it ’ s tougher when you ’ re stupid ,” which likely accounts for the variations in the saying ’ s renderings . ( even people who correctly identify the source of this quote often mistakenly attribute it to the character portrayed in the movie version by actor robert mitchum , eddie ‘ fingers ’ coyle .) <PARA> it has also been claimed that john wayne said this line during a 1966 guest appearance on the dean martin show , in the context of his passing along wisdom to the younger generation . wayne did participate in a segment for that show in which he discussed his thoughts about what he wanted for his then - infant daughter marisa , but a clip of that segment ( no longer available online ) does not record him speaking the line in question .
mixture	a video supposedly showing a piece of raw meat twitching its way off of a dinner table went viral in july 2019 . this video was shared by several different outlets under a variety of captions , but most referred to it as the “ zombie chicken ” video : <PARA> the video first starting circulating on chinese social media sites such as weibo around june 2019 . when the video reached english outlets about a week later , it was frequently accompanied by jokes about “ zombie chicken .” however , when hong kong news covered this video on june 17 , reporters identified the animal as a recently skinned frog . an early posting from the 笑一笑没烦恼 ( laugh , no worries ) facebook page also identified this “ zombie ” meat as frog . <PARA> these sources don ’ t appear to have any first - hand knowledge of the incident , however , so we should take their claims with a grain of salt , too . <PARA> speaking of salt ... this video shows an extremely fresh cut of meat . while this animal is certainly dead , it ’ s neurons are still active and seem to be reacting to sodium ion , a chemical compound that can be found in salt and soy sauce . <PARA> when the scientific american looked into a similar video back in 2011 , they explained : <PARA> scientific american was commenting on the following video from 2009 . while the reaction in this footage is not as severe , it does show how salt can cause a raw piece of meat to twitch : <PARA> an article from brain stuff further explained why these dead animals appear to “ dance ” when salted : <PARA> while we have been unable to track down the exact origins of this video , this footage likely was filmed at a restaurant that practices ikizukuri , which is a method of preparing live seafood . this method of preparation is most commonly used with fish , but octopus , shrimp , lobster , and frogs can also be prepared this way . <PARA> in 2012 , a restaurant in tokyo found itself in the path of protesters after a video showing the making of a live frog sashimi dish went viral . here ’ s how fox news described that video ( which can be seen here ): <PARA> although we can ’ t confirm many of the details about this “ zombie chicken ” “ zombie frog ” video , it certainly falls within the realm of plausibility .

false	origins : shortly after the 7 . 8 magnitude gorkha earthquake struck nepal on 25 april 2015 , <PARA> killing more than 7 , 000 people , images of the devastation it wrought began circulating online . as is often the case in the modern world , however , many of the images <PARA> circulated online were not actually photographs of that event , but repurposed pictures taken at different times and places . <PARA> the above - displayed photograph , for example , doesn ’ t capture an earthquake - related avalanche on mt . everest in the aftermath of the 2015 nepal incident — the picture antedates that event by several years and seems to get trotted out every time a similar occurrence takes place . a year earlier , for example , the same photo was used to illustrate second - hand reporting of a deadly april 2014 avalanche that killed twelve people on the famous mountain : <PARA> before that , the same photo also had previously popped up in an october 2013 report of an everest avalanche that took the lives of four victims : <PARA> and before that , it appeared in a september 2010 blog post referencing an avalanche that had injured several sherpas on an everest climb : <PARA> the original image appeared way back in 2008 on the international mountain guides web site , linked from a 19 october 2008 entry in a blog about a nepal trek and ama dablam climb , and captioned as follows :
false	examples : [ collected via e - mail , 2002 ] <PARA> origins : parents <PARA> concerned with the pernicious influence of television on children could hardly find more innocuous children ’ s tv fare these days than the nickelodeon cartoon spongebob squarepants , the animated adventures of a bright yellow sea sponge who dwells in a pineapple within the subterranean city of bikini bottom , works as a fry cook at the krusty krab , and pals around with his starfish friend , patrick — usually to the general annoyance of bob ’ s cranky neighbor , squidward . spongebob squarepants is the top - rated show on broadcast or cable among youngsters 2 to 11 ( even though an estimated 22 % of its audience is 18 or older ), the program is light - hearted and funny , the main character “ has an unending bounty of innocence and old - fashioned ethics ,” and the themes employed could satisfy even the most tv - cautious parents . ( in one installment , bob and patrick order a big - screen tv because they want to play with the large box it ’ s packaged in , but the irascible squidward is too incredulous to believe they could be having so much fun disdaining the large television and using nothing more than an empty box and their <PARA> imaginations .) <PARA> so why did rumors of the drowning of a spongebob squarepants - obsessed child begin to circulate in september of 2002 , even though no such tragedy occurred ? ( the rumor didn ’ t spring from a cancellation of the series ; spongebob is slated to make his feature film debut in 2004 , and nickelodeon has stockpiled a cache of unaired episodes to dole out until then .) parents have long been cautious , even fearful , of challenges to their authority and influence over their children , and most anything — particularly the new , unfamiliar , and faddish — that seems to occupy an inordinate amount of their children ’ s time and attention is generally viewed with skepticism and suspicion . television was a locus of these fears in the mid - 1950s : <PARA> from mid - decade on , the baleful effects of television on american life became a national obsession . polls , surveys , and experts all agreed that something terrible was happening . people stayed in the house more and read good books less . kids were glued to the set for three or four hours a day . the content of programming aroused “ morbid emotions in children ,” stirred up “ domestic quarrels , . . . loosed morals and ma [ de ] people lazy and sodden .” the kefauver subcommittee of the senate judiciary committee issued a report late in 1955 suggesting that tv caused juvenile delinquency by inuring teenagers to lawless and violent behavior . <PARA> the mechanism whereby clean - cut teens suddenly turned into blue - jeaned mobsters while watching tv was not specified in the report ; perhaps moving pictures induced criminal restlessness in unformed characters . . . at issue was the change from an accepted style to something unfamiliar , from the saturday matinee to weeknight tv , from crew cuts to ducktails and sideburns , from dean martin and charles van doren to elvis presley . <PARA> the mechanism whereby clean - cut teens suddenly turned into blue - jeaned mobsters while watching tv was not specified in the report ; perhaps moving pictures induced criminal restlessness in unformed characters . . . at issue was the change from an accepted style to something unfamiliar , from the saturday matinee to weeknight tv , from crew cuts to ducktails and sideburns , from dean martin and charles van doren to elvis presley . <PARA> from superman ‘ s leading kids to jump out of windows in attempts to fly to beavis and butthead ‘ s spurring a spate of adolescent fire - starting , television has spawned its own collection of rumors demonstrating its supposed ability to prompt dangerous behavior in youngsters — as well as reinforcing the notion that television itself is to blame . these rumors are not reflections of real events ; they ’ re cautionary tales expressive of adult fears and concerns . several familiar “ parental nightmare ” elements can be identified in the spongebob squarepants rumor : <PARA> of the four examples of the spongebob squarepants drowning rumor cited above , only the last one even hints at the presence of responsible adults who should have prevented this apocryphal tragedy from occurring . perhaps that point reflects the true horror of this rumor : parents who leave a three - year - old child to wander the decks of a cruise ship unattended and drown are the ones directly responsible for his death — not television , nickelodeon , or cartoon characters .

true	as scientific concepts such as climate change became contentious political topics , bill nye , the television host of shows such as bill nye the science guy , is becoming an unlikely controversial figure in certain circles . shortly after the debut of his new netflix show bill nye saves the world in 2017 , a series of memes have emerged attempting to discredit him . one such meme compares the educational background of nye and action star dolph lundgren : <PARA> this meme is largely accurate . nye did study mechanical engineering at cornell university , from which he graduated with a bachelor of science degree . and lundgren , who may be best known as an action movie star , has an impressive educational background . the credentials listed in this meme , however , are slightly inaccurate . <PARA> according to a biography on the actor ’ s old web site , lundgren did receive a master ’ s degree in chemical engineering from the university of sydney and was the recipient of a fulbright scholarship at mit : <PARA> the university of sydney said in a facebook post that lundgren was “ our only alumnus ( that we know of ) who ’ s gone toe - to - toe with sylvester stallone .” <PARA> however , lundgren did not receive a bs degree in chemistry from washington state university . the school says on its web site that lundgren spent one year ( 1976 - 1977 ) studying chemical engineering there as an exchange student , but he didn ’ t graduate from the school : <PARA> comparing nye and lundgren is also problematic . the meme appears to insinuate that nye is not qualified to host a television show since his educational background does not match or exceed dolph lundgren ’ s . yet , as far as we know , there is no “ lundgren standard ” for science television show hosts . this argument only makes sense if lundgren , the more educated of the two , had criticized nye or publicly disagreed with something nye had said , yet we found no record of lundgren ’ s expressing such a viewpoint .
false	a warning about hiv - contaminated pepsi products began spreading on the internet and via cell phone text message in july 2011 ( with a resurgence in september 2012 ), and it has also been echoed in recurrent rumors about mango frooti , a popular beverage in india : <PARA> such rumors are standard food contamination urban legends akin to the leper in the chesterfield factory rumor . no news accounts , government agencies , or other reliable sources have reported pepsi or frooti products being contaminated with hiv - infected blood . <PARA> in may 2013 , parie agro ( frooti ’ s parent company ) responded to this “ unjustified rumor ” by posting the following message on their facebook page : <PARA> as for whether consumers can acquire hiv via contaminated food or beverages , the centers for disease control ( cdc ) emphatically says they cannot : <PARA> hiv does not long survive outside its host medium of human bodily fluids : blood , semen , vaginal fluid , breast milk , saliva , tears . ( which is not to say hiv can be transmitted by every one of those : according to the cdc , “ contact with saliva , tears , or sweat has never been shown to result in transmission of hiv .”) the cdc says except under laboratory conditions , hiv is unable to reproduce outside its living host ; it does not spread or maintain infectiousness outside its host . therefore , were hiv - tainted blood to be mixed into foodstuffs or beverages , the virus would neither survive nor while it was still viable multiply and so replenish itself . <PARA> although such cases are rare , the cdc confirms that people have acquired hiv through oral contact with , or swallowing of , hiv - laden bodily fluids . however , no known infections involving oral transmission of hiv have so far come from contact with , or ingestion of , a food product or beverage ; all such infections involved sexual contact . <PARA> other ingestibles have previously been fingered as vehicles for the transmission of hiv - infected blood to the unsuspecting public , and these stories too were baseless : the 2004 scare about restaurant ketchup dispensers and the 2005 - 2006 scare about pineapples .

false	a vehicle at 15 mpg and 12 , 000 miles per year uses 800 gallons a year of gasoline . <PARA> a vehicle at 25 mpg and 12 , 000 miles per year uses 480 gallons a year . <PARA> so , the average clunker transaction will reduce us gasoline consumption by 320 gallons per year . <PARA> they claim 700 , 000 vehicles — so that ’ s 224 million gallons / year . <PARA> that equates to a bit over 5 million barrels of oil . <PARA> 5 million barrels of oil is about 1 ⁄ 4 of one day ’ s us consumption . <PARA> and , 5 million barrels of oil costs about $ 350 million dollars at $ 75 / bbl . <PARA> so , we all contributed to spending $ 3 billion to save $ 350 million . <PARA> how good a deal was that ??? <PARA> they ’ ll probably do a great job with health care though !! <PARA> origins : in 2009 , the federal government ’ s car allowance rebate system ( cars ), commonly known as “ cash for clunkers ,” provided consumers with $ 3 , 500 or $ 4 , 500 discounts for trading in older model automobiles and purchasing new , more fuel - efficient vehicles . the analysis presented above maintains that the cars program essentially spent $ 3 billion in federal ( i . e ., taxpayer ) funds in order to save $ 350 million in ( foreign ) oil purchases , an inefficient economic trade - off . <PARA> the premise that the sole purpose or benefit of the cars program is to save money on u . s . expenditures is a rather specious one to begin with . and even within that framework , <PARA> the analysis is flawed in key aspects . <PARA> according to the latest cars statistics , auto dealers conducted 690 , 114 transactions through the program , and cars traded in through the program averaged 15 . 8 mpg , while new vehicles purchased through the program averaged 24 . 9 mpg . assuming , as stated above , that the average motorist drives 12 , 000 miles per year , we arrive at the following calculations : <PARA> a vehicle averaging 15 . 8 mpg driven 12 , 000 miles per year uses 759 . 5 gallons of gasoline per year . <PARA> a vehicle averaging 24 . 9 mpg driven 12 , 000 miles per year uses 482 gallons of gasoline per year . <PARA> the average cars transaction will reduce u . s . gasoline consumption by 277 . 5 gallons of gasoline per car per year . <PARA> the 690 , 114 vehicles sold through the cars program will therefore save a total of 191 . 5 million gallons of gasoline per year . <PARA> a vehicle averaging 24 . 9 mpg driven 12 , 000 miles per year uses 482 gallons of gasoline per year . <PARA> the average cars transaction will reduce u . s . gasoline consumption by 277 . 5 gallons of gasoline per car per year . <PARA> the 690 , 114 vehicles sold through the cars program will therefore save a total of 191 . 5 million gallons of gasoline per year . <PARA> so far , so good — our figures make the cars program look even less economically efficient than the original analysis does . the fatal flaw comes in the next step , however . <PARA> the example presented above claims that 224 million gallons of gasoline are the equivalent of 5 million barrels of oil ( i . e ., one barrel of oil produces about 45 gallons of gasoline ), which is an erroneous assumption . one barrel of crude oil holds 42 gallons of crude oil , not 42 gallons of gasoline — the crude has to be put through a refining process before it becomes gasoline . how much gasoline is produced from one barrel of crude varies according to the refining process used and the type of crude oil involved , but according to the energy information administration ( eia ), a branch of the u . s . department of energy , “ u . s . refineries produce between 19 and 20 gallons of motor gasoline from one barrel ( 42 gallons ) of crude oil .” ( crude oil contains many different types of hydrocarbons , not all of which can easily be converted to gasoline , so other petroleum products such as kerosene and lubricating oil are also produced during the refining process .) <PARA> if we take the mid - point of that range ( i . e ., 19 . 5 gallons of gasoline per barrel of oil ) and multiply it by the $ 75 per barrel price quoted in the example , we find : <PARA> 191 . 5 million gallons of gasoline / 19 . 5 gallons of gasoline per barrel of oil = 9 . 8 million barrels of oil <PARA> 9 . 8 million * $ 75 per barrel = $ 735 million <PARA> 9 . 8 million * $ 75 per barrel = $ 735 million <PARA> this savings of $ 735 million per year is over twice the $ 350 million figure posited in the original analysis . ( the latter figure should actually be $ 375 million ; the original contains a mathematical error in stating that 5 million multiplied by 75 equals 350 .) moreover , the gasoline - saving benefits produced by the cars program won ’ t simply dissipate after the passage of a single year , as suggested above . according to the <PARA> cars stats , the total dollar value of transactions conducted under the “ cash for clunkers ” program was about $ 2 . 9 billion . therefore ( if all other factors remained the same ), the full cost of the cars program would be offset by gasoline savings in about four years — not a spectacular trade - off , perhaps , but not nearly as bad a one as claimed in the original analysis . ( all of these figures assume the price of gasoline to be a constant , a dubious proposition since the cost of oil can fluctuate quite widely , especially in the short term .) <PARA> the original analysis also focuses solely on savings in gasoline costs and doesn ’ t take into account other intended or residual effects of the cars program , such as the economic benefits of boosting auto sales , reducing pollution by replacing older cars with more fuel - efficient vehicles , increasing safety by replacing older cars with vehicles offering advanced safety features , and providing additional parts and raw materials for the market : <PARA> [ the clunkers ’] components and frames ... have begun flooding the used parts and scrap - recycling markets with more than 100 million tons of steel , batteries , and tires , among other things . <PARA> “ this is like a second wave of stimulus to our economy ,” said bill goodale , general manager of millis industries , which has picked up about 200 clunkers from local dealers and expects to take possession of hundreds more in the next few weeks . “ as it trickles down , it helps junkyards . it helps the guy looking for cheap parts to keep his car going . it adds a lot of steel to a market that hasn ’ t produced much of it in the last year .” <PARA> “ this is like a second wave of stimulus to our economy ,” said bill goodale , general manager of millis industries , which has picked up about 200 clunkers from local dealers and expects to take possession of hundreds more in the next few weeks . “ as it trickles down , it helps junkyards . it helps the guy looking for cheap parts to keep his car going . it adds a lot of steel to a market that hasn ’ t produced much of it in the last year .”
mixture	origins : on 21 september 2012 , a charter plane carrying ann romney , the wife of republican presidential candidate mitt romney , from omaha to santa monica , california , was forced to make an emergency landing in denver after the pilot reported seeing smoke in the cockpit . the following day , at a fundraiser in beverly hills , mitt romney was quoted by the los angeles times as having said the following about his wife ’ s experience : <PARA> “ i appreciate the fact that she is on the ground , safe and sound . and i don ’ t think she knows just how worried some of us were ,” romney said . “ when you have a fire in an aircraft , there ’ s no place to go , exactly , there ’ s no — and you can ’ t find any oxygen from outside the aircraft to get in the aircraft , because the windows don ’ t open . i don ’ t know why they don ’ t do that . it ’ s a real problem . so it ’ s very dangerous . and she was choking and rubbing her eyes . fortunately , there was enough oxygen for the pilot and copilot to make a safe landing in denver . but she ’ s safe and sound .” <PARA> the day after publishing that comment about airplane windows , the los angeles times noted : <PARA> the candidate ’ s complaint about sealed plane windows quickly went viral on social media . some are making fun of romney for not knowing about the risks involved with an open window , while others think it might be just a joke . <PARA> a review of video footage of mitt romney ’ s remarks shows that it is literally true that he did speak the words attributed to him , but it ’ s not true that , as claimed , he was genuinely expressing confusion about why airplane windows don ’ t open . when he said “ i don ’ t know why they don ’ t do that ” ( in reference to airplane windows ’ not opening ), his delivery clearly indicated that he intended the line to be taken as a tongue - in - cheek aside rather than as a serious statement : <PARA> new york magazine reported that : <PARA> the los angeles times story that relayed romney ’ s airplane remark to the world was based off a pool report written by the new york times ‘ s ashley parker . when we asked parker whether it seemed as if romney made the mark in jest , she left no doubt . “ romney was joking ,” she e - mailed . parker told us that while the pool report didn ’ t explicitly indicate that romney was joking , it was self - evident that he was . “ the pool report provided the full transcript of his comments on ann ’ s plane scare ,” she said , “ and it was clear from the context that he was not being serious .” <PARA> similarly , theblaze reported that : <PARA> william everitt , vice president of investment real estate associates ( irea ), [ said ] that he was at the romney fundraiser in beverly hills . he said romney was absolutely joking when he said he doesn ‘ t know why airplane windows don ’ t open . <PARA> “ basically he was retelling the story and when he said ‘ i don ’ t know why they don ’ t have roll down windows on airplanes ,’ he looked at the audience and everyone laughed ,” everitt [ said ]. “ it was a clearly delivered joke ... there were 1 , 000 people there that will tell you the same thing .” <PARA> “ basically he was retelling the story and when he said ‘ i don ’ t know why they don ’ t have roll down windows on airplanes ,’ he looked at the audience and everyone laughed ,” everitt [ said ]. “ it was a clearly delivered joke ... there were 1 , 000 people there that will tell you the same thing .”
mixture	on 21 august 2015 , fox news columnist todd starnes published an article titled “ school band told to stop performing ‘ how great thou art .'” starnes ’ opinion piece drew national attention to a debate initially localized to brandon , mississippi , over the mixing of prayer and other religious elements with school events : <PARA> starnes ’ take on the events at brandon high school was largely accurate , although typically one - sided and exaggerated . the portion about a “ lone voice ” singing a “ forbidden song ,” for example , was misleading since spectators were not in any way prohibited by court order from singing hymns or engaging in other religious speech ( nor had a judge specifically enjoined the band from performing “ how great thou art ”). <PARA> soon after starnes ’ column appeared , social media rumors circulated claiming that a federal judge ( appointed by president obama ) forbade the brandon high school marching band from including the hymn “ how great thou art ” from their halftime show . but that condensed version of events didn ’ t correctly sum up precisely what was going on in brandon . <PARA> first , it ’ s true that u . s . district court judge carlton reeves was appointed by president obama in april 2010 . it ’ s also true that reeves issued a ruling in july 2015 in which he found the school district to be in violation of an earlier agreement pertaining to prayer in schools . <PARA> as the clarion ledger reported on 22 august 2015 , the school board ( and not reeves ) made the decision to eliminate “ how great thou art ” from the halftime show , and that decision was made by the district in order to comply with previous court rulings that pertained to a 2013 lawsuit brought by a northwest rankin high school student : <PARA> as the article excerpted above clearly indicated , the district ( not judge reeves ) opted to pull a christian hymn (“ how great thou art ”) from a school - related event due to previous incidents during which they were found to be in violation of extant court orders . a statement from the school issued on 21 august 2015 quoted the court order in question : <PARA> notably , “ administrators , teachers and staff of the rankin county school district ” were specifically mentioned in the federal court order . ( parents , students , and spectators were not bound by it , and thus did not engage in singing a “ forbidden song ” during the halftime show , a pervasive misconception that conflates the right to impose prayer with a right to voluntary prayer .) that inaccurate interpretation appeared to be widespread among persons affiliated with the school : <PARA> although judge reeves issued a ruling permanently enjoining school district staff from endorsing the practices of any specific religion in the course of school activities , the school district decided to remove “ how great thou art ” from their halftime lineup on their own after having been found in violation of a previous agreement to cease including religious material in school - sponsored events .

remember ... message me only . if you get it right i ’ ll post your name here . if you get it wrong change your profile picture .... this is for you to copy and paste <PARA> now , there ’ s another message that goes like this : <PARA> ** urgent ** giraffe game notice ** urgent ** <PARA> whoah ! just found out that the giraffe challenge was set up by the hacking group anonymous . apparently they ’ re going to embark on a random “ cleansing ” program which will wipe out the bank accounts and hard drives of those people who have giraffe profile pics ... a few of my mates already had it happen , so gets to changing your pics back !!! lol <PARA> microsoft and google are working on it now , oct 25 . we recommend facebook users : do not change your profile picture to giraffes . <PARA> a virus that exploits the recently discovered jpeg vulnerability has been discovered spreading over google ’ s giraffe pictures . <PARA> “ it ’ s been done in the past , but with html code instead of the jpeg ,” said james thompson , chief technical officer for sans ’ internet storm center , the organization ’ s online - security research unit . “ it is a virus , but it didn ’ t spread very far . we ’ ve only had two reports of it .” <PARA> the facebook message goes like this : “ i just changed my profile picture to a giraffe , but my answer was wrong ” when you do it , facebook automatically gives the hackers your user mail and password , malicious code embedded in the jpeg image gives the hackers everything they need , james said . <PARA> the code also installs a back door that can give hackers remote control over the infected computer . antivirus expert fred hypponen of f - secure warned on wednesday that the jpeg exploit can also damage your iphone if you charge it with your computer . by default , antivirus software only scans for . exe files . and even if users change the settings on antivirus software , the jpeg file name extensions can be manipulated to avoid detection . <PARA> origins : a message circulated via facebook in october 2013 entreated users to take part in “ the great giraffe challenge .” participants in this challenge were supposed to take a shot at answering a posted riddle ( like the one reproduced above ) and message the poster with their guess at the correct response ; participants who tried but came up incorrect answers were obliged by the rules of the challenge to change their facebook profile pictures to photographs of giraffes for the next three days . <PARA> this “ challenge ” was circulated in tandem with a warning that the game was simply a furtive way of luring users into compromising their facebook accounts and computers by posting jpeg - based images of giraffes , images that harbored malicious code which could exploit a jpeg vulnerability to give hackers “ your user mail and password ” and allow them “ remote control over your computer ,” as well as “ damage your iphone if you charge it with your computer .” <PARA> the giraffe game may be a genuine bit of fun , but the associated virus warning is nothing but bunk . there is no virus lurking in jpeg - based images of giraffes , and facebook users who change their profile pictures to photographs or drawings of giraffes <PARA> do not risk compromising their computers and facebook accounts to hackers or damaging their iphones . the quoted warning from the “ chief technical officer for sans ’ internet storm center ” is an outdated , nine - year - old one which addressed an issue that has long since been resolved and had nothing to do with facebook . <PARA> back in 2004 , a vulnerability was discovered that could enable programs used for viewing jpeg image files on microsoft windows - based computers to launch malicious code . numerous warnings about the vulnerability were put out , and microsoft issued a patch for the exploit in mid - september 2004 . only a rather old , unpatched windows - based system would be vulnerable to that exploit today , and it would not be attached to any particular type or class of jpeg - based images ( such as pictures of giraffes ). someone simply borrowed portions of a rather old computer security article to lend credence to a new hoax involving a “ giraffe challenge .” <PARA> in short , the giraffe challenge may be silly , but it ’ s relatively harmless , and taking part in it will not infect your computer or provide hackers with access to your accounts . <PARA> and for those who still haven ’ t found it , the answer to the quoted riddle (“ it ’ s 3 : 00 am , the doorbell rings and you wake up . unexpected visitors ! it ’ s your parents , and they are there for breakfast . you have strawberry jam , honey , wine , bread and cheese . what is the first thing you open ?”) is either “ your eyes ” or “ the door .”
true	among the many controversies that have swirled around the administration of president donald trump since its inception are its characterization of inaccurate information as “ alternative facts ” and the engagement of trump ’ s daughter ivanka as a presidential adviser despite her lack of experience in government and politics . <PARA> those two controversies coalesced in a meme holding that ivanka trump had once proclaimed that “ perception is more important than reality ” and then had amplified that remark by saying , “ if someone perceives something to be true , it is more important than if it is in fact true . this doesn ’ t mean you should be duplicitous or deceitful , but don ’ t go our of your way to correct a false assumption if it plays to your advantage ”: <PARA> the meme attributes these words to the trump card : playing to win in work and life , a 2009 “ self - help book aimed at helping women achieve success in work and life ,” by ivanka trump ( written well before her father was elected president ). that passage does in fact appear in the book , as illustrated below : <PARA> authorship of the trump card is credited solely to ivanka trump , but given the prevalent use of uncredited ghostwriters and co - authors in the publishing industry for works from celebrities , we can ’ t say for certain whether trump herself wrote this statement exactly as presented . nonetheless , it is accurate to say that those words are correctly attributed to her .
false	on 5 october 2017 , the disreputable web site gotnews . com — run by notorious internet troll chuck c . johnson — reported ( with no evidence or citations ) that the security guard being lauded as a hero for his role in helping to stop the massacre perpetrated by las vegas strip shooter stephen paddock was , in fact , an accomplice in the shooting . <PARA> stephen paddock , 64 , has been named as the lone gunman by law enforcement in the 1 october 2017 mass shooting , in which he fired on a music festival crowd of 22 , 000 with a modified automatic weapon from a suite in the 32nd floor of the mandalay bay resort and casino , killing 58 and wounding hundreds . high - ranking officials from the las vegas metropolitan police department , the law enforcement agency leading the investigation , have said that while they still don ’ t know if paddock had any accomplices in planning the attack , they have on several occasions confirmed that per their investigation , he was the only shooter . <PARA> large - scale tragedies like mass shootings and terrorist attacks have been unfortunate lures for conspiracy theorists and purveyors of false information in the internet age . disreputable web sites latch on to the chaotic aftermaths of such incidents to seduce audiences with “ alternatives ” to official investigations , claiming to harbor the “ truth ” that dishonest officials and the “ mainstream media ” are hiding from the public . for example , gotnews stories carry this fundraising plug : <PARA> gotnews didn ’ t provide in its story any evidence to support their claim that hotel security guard jesus campos was an accomplice , other than an anonymous “ official ” with the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms ( atf ). gotnews reported : <PARA> the atf contacted gotnews to notify them the story was inaccurate ; the story was then updated with this disclaimer : <PARA> however , another disreputable web site , yournewswire . com , which regurgitated the gotnews story on 6 october 2017 , did not include this crucial “ update ” to alert readers that the allegations in the story were disputed by the very agency cited . <PARA> we followed up with the atf to ask whether any of their employees had been in contact with gotnews . the agency responded : <PARA> we sent johnson a detailed list of questions about the gotnews story , but johnson only responded asking that we “ please print ” his claim to have a source with atf . <PARA> we found no evidence to support stories that report campos acted in any other way than heroically . campos has been hailed as a hero by the police department for not only locating paddock ’ s room , but braving a hail of gunfire in doing so .. police said campos provided them with a door key to the suite and stayed to help them evacuate other guests until officers ordered him to seek medical aid for a gunshot wound to the leg ( there are no reports that campos had a wound to his arm , as gotnews claims ). <PARA> during a 4 october 2017 press conference , clark county sheriff joseph lombardo said : <PARA> in another update on 6 october 2017 , lvmpd undersheriff kevin mcmahill reiterated that campos ’ s actions were nothing other than heroic : <PARA> this is not the first time johnson has framed an innocent person ( a heroic one , no less ) in the aftermath of a deadly incident . dallas attorney andrew sommerman is representing in a pending defamation suit the family of joel vangheluwe , who johnson wrongly identified as the driver of the dodge charger that ran down a group of counter - demonstrators at a white supremacist rally in charlottesville , virginia in mid - august . he said of johnson : <PARA> on 12 august 2017 , gotnews “ retracted ” the article naming vangheluwe as the driver of the car that rammed into the crowd , leaving 32 - year - old charlottesville resident heather heyer dead , allegedly because the police hadn ’ t yet named a suspect . why gotnews backtracked in that case to defer to police but not in the case of campos is unclear but accuracy doesn ’ t seem to have been the goal — as of 6 october 2017 , the gotnews story still says “ police have not identified the suspect ,” even though james alex fields was not only publicly identified but also charged with the crime the day the story was published . <PARA> johnson , 28 , has a long and dizzying history of scandal as a semi - successful internet troll . he gained widespread notoriety when he attempted to out a woman who had anonymously written a disputed column about being raped on campus for rolling stone , but then identified the wrong woman . in 2015 , he joined a short list of people banned by twitter after a tweet asking supporters for funding to help “ take out ” civil rights activist deray mckession . johnson is also behind the crowdfunding web site wesearchr , where he has raised funds for supporters of the neo - nazi web site daily stormer and a movement of white supremacists who chartered ( then abandoned ) a ship in an effort to scuttle the efforts of aid organizations trying to rescue migrants making the deadly mediterranean sea crossing between north africa and europe . <PARA> during a press briefing on 9 october 2017 , lombardo said investigators revised the shooting timeline , noting that paddock shot campos six minutes before he opened fire on the crowd . lombardo acknowledged that campos was shot at 9 : 59 p . m . responding to ap reporter ken ritter ’ s question , lombardo said : <PARA> variations : on 12 october 2017 , readers asked about a purported cnn item reporting the claim as news : <PARA> a fake news web site posing as cnn published an article reiterating the debunked rumor on 11 october 2017 : <PARA> the domain name ( cnn - internationaledition . com ) and use of cnn ’ s logos successfully duped social media users into believing the story was legitimate and sharing it . hosting records revealed that the site was registered on 10 october 2017 , one day prior to the publication of the article . additional registrar details indicated that the site was registered outside the united states by an individual , not cnn .
unproven	origins : thanks to our association of them with filth , poverty , disease , and death , rats are almost universally loathed and feared . we blame them for the plague ( also known as the “ black death ”) that wiped out a third of europe ’ s population in the middle ages . we dislike the look of them , finding their long , pointed snouts , sharp teeth , beady eyes , and thick ropy tails visually unsettling . we ’ re bothered by how they go about their business , finding fault with their lurking in the shadows of inhabited areas to feast upon garbage . and we ’ re disturbed by how many of them might be living unnoticed in close proximity to us , fearing that they may have us outnumbered . <PARA> folklore has long associated this class of rodent with calamity . rats are believed to have a sixth sense regarding death and disaster ; thus , by studying their actions , one can pick up timely warnings about misfortune headed one ’ s way . as to why this might be so , it is said rats come by their foreknowledge about human events because they house the souls of the deceased . <PARA> pay particular attention to the sight of rats deserting a ship , especially one still in port . such an exodus is said to presage a disaster that will shortly befall the ship , even if the vessel is one that appears entirely sound . <PARA> in 1889 three people working on the paris c . brown , a riverboat that sailed between louisiana and ohio , spotted some rats leaving the ship . they decided to heed the implied warning and not reboard the vessel . shortly thereafter , the paris c . brown struck a snag which went through her hull , sinking the ship in a <PARA> matter of two or three minutes . while there were survivors of that wreck , the accident killed eleven . <PARA> on the other hand , rats seen boarding a new ship should be taken as a good sign . <PARA> it is also very unlucky to utter the word “ rat ” while on a ship , with such prohibitions having been noted as far back as 1886 . one should therefore find a substitute word to use for such occasions . <PARA> similar to the “ rats leaving a ship ” belief , the sight of rats abandoning a house for no apparent reason should be taken as a bad sign — either the structure itself is about to collapse or dire misfortune looms over one of the home ’ s inhabitants . <PARA> speaking of predictions of harm befalling particular individuals , rats gnawing on one ’ s clothes or chewing on furniture , especially bedroom furniture , is an omen of death . pliny even noted this in his a . d . 77 natural history ( albeit about mice rather than rats ): “ by gnawing the silver shields at lanuvium , mice prognosticated the marsian war ; and the death of our general , carbo , at clusium , by gnawing the latchets with which he fastened his shoes .” <PARA> also similar to the “ rats boarding a new ship ” belief , an influx of rats into a structure supposedly indicates the homeowners will soon be moving , or possibly that they are about to come into money . ( rats apparently know where the good times are .) <PARA> as to how to get rid of rats , superstition holds that the most effective way to empty a home of them is to ask them to leave . one method is to sit by the rat hole and politely request that they move on . another method is to write a letter to the vermin , preferably a short note that politely asks them to leave the property and recommends a nearby structure where they will likely flourish ( such as the home of a disliked neighbor ). said missive should be neatly penned , folded , and shoved into the rat hole . <PARA> writing notes to rats in supplication of getting them to leave is an old practice , one that dates as far back as the first century . this example comes from 1869 : <PARA> rats and mice , <PARA> leave this poor person ’ s house , <PARA> go on away over to the mill <PARA> and there you ’ ll all get your fill . <PARA> a sudden massive increase in the number of rats in a community is taken as a sign of imminent war , with that belief noted as far back as 1682 . <PARA> dreaming that one is being attacked by rats is said to reveal that someone in your waking life harbors plans to harm you . <PARA> finally , because rats are thought to have extremely strong teeth , when a child ’ s baby tooth is to be discarded , it should be done by leaving it near a rat hole along with an appeal to the rats to “ send a stronger one ” in its place . <PARA> barbara “ tooth ferry ” mikkelson
false	president trump ’ s second nominee to the u . s . supreme court , judge brett kavanaugh , was confirmed by the senate in october 2018 after a contentious hearing process upended by allegations of sexual assault and a supplementary investigation by the fbi . <PARA> kavanaugh ’ s accuser , dr . christine blasey ford , testified under oath that he had sexually assaulted her at a party in 1982 , an accusation the nominee vehemently denied . the fbi failed to corroborate ford ’ s testimony , paving the way for a close , largely party line vote in favor of confirmation on 6 october . <PARA> all along , partisan supporters of kavanaugh had portrayed dr . ford as a dupe , at best , in an alleged conspiracy by democrats to derail the nomination by smearing his reputation . the day kavanaugh was confirmed , a video clip began making the rounds in which house minority leader nancy pelosi ( d - california ) could allegedly be heard revealing the democratic party ’ s template for such attacks , a tactic she called the “ wrap - up smear ”: <PARA> a version of the clip also appeared on hyperpartisan websites such as infowars . com , where it accompanied an article saying that pelosi ’ s description was “ eerily similar to what we saw happen to justice brett kavanaugh ”: <PARA> the clips are authentic in the respect that they were extracted from an actual c - span video of pelosi ’ s weekly press briefing on 22 june 2017 , but seriously misleading in the respect that they were trimmed in such a way as to omit their original context . <PARA> as a longer clip and transcript clearly show , pelosi was calling out republicans for conducting wrap - up smear campaigns , not touting the phenomenon as a go - to strategy for democrats : <PARA> in fact , this wasn ’ t the first time pelosi brought up the term “ wrap - up smear ” specifically to describe republican political tactics . in this 6 march 2017 exchange between pelosi and cnn news anchor jake tapper , she claimed president trump used such a smear tactic against former president barack obama : <PARA> we were unable to find any instances of pelosi ’ s stating or advocating that democrats use such a tactic .
true	on 19 january 2019 , while stumping with reporters outside the white house to promote the efficacy of his proposed wall along the u . s .- mexico border , president trump cited the city of san antonio , texas , as an example of a city made much safer by the construction of a wall : <PARA> “ everybody knows that walls work ,” trump maintained . “ you look at different places , they put up a wall , no problem . you look at san antonio , you look at so many different places , they go from one of the most unsafe cities in the country to one of the safest cities , immediately , immediately .” <PARA> president trump ’ s words left many viewers puzzled , as the city of san antonio not only has no wall , but it isn ’ t situated anywhere near a national border . it ’ s about 150 miles north of mexico , and it has been far removed from the mexican border since texas achieved independence in 1836 and was subsequently annexed into the united states in 1845 . <PARA> most likely president trump confused san antonio with the western texas city of el paso ( just across the mexico – u . s . border from ciudad juárez ), which he had described in similar terms a week earlier : <PARA> “ el paso , texas , went from one of the most unsafe parts or cities in the united states to one of the safest cities in the united states as soon as they put up the wall ,” trump said . “ they built a wall and fencing apparatus that blocked people . so they went from one of the most dangerous cities to one of the safest cities , all within a very short period of time .” <PARA> some news accounts have disputed trump ’ s claims about the construction of a wall ’ s supposedly having made el paso immediately and significantly safer , averring that reports show a decline in violent crime rates antedated el paso ’ s border wall construction , and a slight rise occurred afterwards :

false	origins : on 28 may 2014 , the world news daily report web site published an article positing that the kenyan government had released “ 11 exclusive documents ” suggesting that barack obama was born in that country . <PARA> the office of the principal register of the nyanza province , in kenya , has finally released 11 exclusive documents concerning barack obama ’ s alleged birth and early childhood in the country . these official papers had been requested for years by the tea party patriots , an american conservative organization , to no avail , but the kenyan supreme court recently ordered authorities to release the documents , based on a law on “ access to information . these files , if they turn out to be verifiable , could mean that mr . obama had no legal right to become the american president under the country ’ s law . <PARA> the papers released today suggest that barack obama was actually born on march 7 1960 , in lamu , kenya , more than a year before his father moved to hawaii , where he allegedly met his mother . this contradicts most of the documents presented by the presidential office over the last years , suggesting that either the american or the kenyan papers are actually fakes . <PARA> the papers released today suggest that barack obama was actually born on march 7 1960 , in lamu , kenya , more than a year before his father moved to hawaii , where he allegedly met his mother . this contradicts most of the documents presented by the presidential office over the last years , suggesting that either the american or the kenyan papers are actually fakes . <PARA> soon afterwards links and excerpts referencing this item were being circulated via social media , with many of those who encountered it mistaking it for a genuine news article . however , that article was just another spoof from world news daily report , a tabloid - like web site whose stock in trade is publishing fantastically fictional stories such as “ 200 million year old dinosaur egg hatches in berlin museum and “ miner found alive after 17 years underground .”
false	devastating bushfires tore through eastern australia in late 2019 , destroying a large swath of koala habitat , and a viral piece of misinformation saying koalas are “ functionally extinct ” as a result swept through the internet , prompting visceral reactions . <PARA> forbes on nov . 23 , 2019 was among the first publications to report this inaccurate information with a viral piece authored by a senior contributor to the site , headlined , “ koalas ‘ functionally extinct ’ after australia bushfires destroy 80 % of their habitat .” forbes reported : <PARA> the story circulated as people shared emotional news about koalas being killed and injured by the fires , a tragedy symbolized by widely seen video of a woman rescuing a koala from bushfire flames . the animal , who was given the name ellenborough lewis , was taken to koala hospital port macquarie for treatment but had to be euthanized on nov . 25 due to his injuries , despite efforts to save him . <PARA> the term “ functionally extinct ” in this context , according to ecologist diana fisher , “ is used in several different senses . it can mean that a species has declined to a point where it can no longer play the role it once did in [ an ] ecosystem , with significant effects on that ecosystem .” speaking to the new scientist , fisher said the animals are not functionally extinct in this sense , but noted , “ many populations of koalas are falling sharply due to habitat loss and global warming .” <PARA> it is indisputable that the australian wildfires in late november 2019 had a devastating impact on the country ’ s koala population . but experts weighed in to dispute reports that the animals were “ functionally extinct ” after that claim went viral . for example , the new york times reported that “ some scientists warned that exaggeration can hurt , rather than help , conservation efforts .” <PARA> the times quoted jacquelyn gill , associate professor at the university of maine ’ s climate change institute and school of biology and ecology , saying , “ what is particularly frustrating about the term ‘ functional extinction ’ is it indicates a population that is basically past the point of no return , so it means that nothing really can be done . that might seem like scientists quibbling over terms or trying to argue for nerdy levels of precision , but a strong statement like that should mean something .” <PARA> following pushback , forbes changed the article headline to read , “ fires may have killed up to 1 , 000 koalas , fueling concerns over the future of the species ,” and added an editor ’ s note stating , “ since publication , the headline and lede of this story have been changed to better reflect the content of the reporting , and some clarifications have been made .” <PARA> the chief source for the forbes article was deborah tabart , who chairs the australian koala foundation ( akf ), a non - profit organization that strives to protect the animals . but forbes failed to note that tabart made the statement it cited in a may 2019 akf press release , which was published before the wildfires took place . <PARA> in press interviews following the fallout from the forbes story , tabart defended the claim that koalas are “ functionally extinct ,” telling the times , “ i absolutely know that there ’ s not one koala population that ’ s safe . i don ’ t care what anyone says . i have been there . i ’ ve seen it . i ’ ve written about it . i ’ ve been dedicated to this job for 31 years .” <PARA> but tabart also released a statement on nov . 14 in which she indicated the impact of the bushfires on the koala population was not yet known . “ it is difficult for the australian koala foundation ( akf ) to make any meaningful comments regarding the current australian bushfires until the fires are over and people on the ground have evaluated the situation . we will await their advice . the akf believes that any koala losses at this time will be significant , given the koala is already listed as vulnerable under the environmental protection and biodiversity conservation act .” <PARA> the dispute over the term “ functionally extinct ” should not diminish the fact that experts agree the koala population is in jeopardy . as the times reported : <PARA> although experts agree that koalas are vulnerable and need to be protected , the forbes article that reports koalas are “ functionally extinct ” as the result of recent australian bushfires is misleading . we therefore rate this claim “ false .”
false	in late june 2016 , a number of conservative web site including the conservative tribune and red flag news published articles with clickbait headlines reporting that president obama had just done something to the white house logo that was an “ outrage ,” “ beyond the pale ,” or “ would make you sick ”: <PARA> typically included in such articles were two images ; one showing the white house logo as it originally appeared before president obama supposedly had his way with it , and the latter showing the commander - in - chief ’ s “ whitewashing ” of the design : <PARA> articles and critical blog posts published in june 2016 claimed the change “[ had ] many people wondering if obama was trying to secretly signal to america ’ s enemies that he was surrendering .” <PARA> but on 15 june 2016 , the advertising industry publication adweek poked fun at conspiracy theories in an article eassying various errors in common depictions of the white house . adweek sourced much of their material from an april 2016 blog post published on medium by the ad agency hello monday which was similarly written from a humorous perspective and provided some background regarding the agency ’ s firsthand involvement with updating the white house logo : <PARA> after providing examples of prior versions of the white house logo , hello monday affirmed that elements such as the “ white flag of surrender ” found in the current logo had ( despite all the june 2016 pearl clutching ) been created in 2003 and had been used on the official white house web site since 2007 , during the george w . bush administration : <PARA> a screen capture of the official white house web site from december 2007 proves that the blue - and - white logo antedates the obama administration : <PARA> indeed , the “ white flag ” white house logo was used at least as far back as september 2003 ( during the administration of george w . bush ), when it appeared on the cover of a progress report on the global war on terrorism : <PARA> hello monday ’ s president andreas anderskou was asked by adweek whether certain aspects of the white house logo that differ from literal depictions of the structure ( i . e ., “ errors ”) were a form of copyright trap : <PARA> it ’ s likely that june 2016 blog posts claiming president obama had just “ changed ” the white house logo were inspired by the recent adweek article , which itself explicitly noted that the modification in question had occurred more than five years before barack obama was elected president .
false	“ what if ?” alternative history scenarios are a favorite topic of conjecture for everyone from barroom philosophers to professional historians . how different might our world be today if a prominent historical figure had never been born , had died before achieving prominence , or had been prevented from dying early ? how much of what we know might be changed if we could go back in time and alter the outcome of some key event ? that we cannot establish definitive answers for these questions doesn ’ t matter — the challenge and the fun are in the speculation . <PARA> one of the quirkier historical “ what if ?” scenarios involves the legend that cuban leader fidel castro was once given a tryout ( and rejected ) by an american major league baseball team ( usually specified as either the washington senators or the new york yankees ): <PARA> consider what might have turned out differently had fidel taken up a career in professional baseball rather than politics : no revolution overthrowing the batista regime , no establishment of a soviet - aligned government in cuba , and thus no bay of pigs or cuban missile crisis — watershed events in the history of the cold war . would the results of this alternate scenario have been a profound difference in the course of world events or merely a historical footnote of minor global significance ? <PARA> even if one opts for the “ historical footnote ” interpretation , the castro legend is still appealing because of its unconventionality . many alternative history scenarios are based upon a consideration of what might have happened if an influential historical figure not died — or been prevented from dying — while still in his prime ( e . g ., “ what if kennedy hadn ’ t been assassinated ?”, “ what if one of the attempts to kill hitler in 1939 or 1944 had succeeded ?”, “ what if stonewall jackson hadn ’ t been mortally wounded at battle of chancellorsville ?”), but the key element of the castro legend is its presentation of an unfinished political career interrupted not by a premature death , but by a love for sports . <PARA> aside from offering intriguing possibilities for historical speculation , this legend has obvious appeal to americans as a tale denigrating castro ( or communism in general ) through its ironic implication that a committed socialist ( and later marxist ) could easily have been derailed from his revolutionary path by the frivolous allure of being paid by capitalists to throw a little white ball around a baseball field — and that he failed in the endeavor because his skills simply weren ’ t up to snuff . <PARA> although this legend has an aura of plausibility to americans in that baseball has long flourished in cuba , and castro was a very visible supporter of ( and pseudo - participant in ) the sport , it is neither true nor credible , as cubans have always been aware . castro never had a tryout with a major - league baseball team , never played the sport professionally , and didn ’ t come close to possessing skills which would attract the interest of a big - league team . as yale professor roberto gonzález echevarría noted in his history of cuban baseball , the claim that castro was a star pitcher at the university of havana and turned down a $ 5 , 000 bonus offer from the new york giants in 1951 to pursue a law degree was nothing more than a reporter ’ s fabrication : <PARA> this tale includes a few other folkloric elements as well . the archly humorous detail of castro ’ s having a tryout with the washington senators ( making him a ‘ senator ’ in america ’ s capital city ) or the new york yankees ( installing him as a ‘ yankee ’ in the u . s . a .’ s largest metropolis ) is great bit of irony . <PARA> on the more serious side , the examples quoted at the head of this page reflect a common theme of trivializing an enemy by presenting its leadership as driven by a superficial , ridiculously - motivated hatred . just as rumor has ascribed hitler ’ s anti - semitism to his anger over having been denied admission to art school by a jewish professor who flunked him on the entrance examination , and osama bin laden ’ s loathing of the u . s . to his embarrassment over an american girl ’ s poking fun at the size of his penis , so castro ’ s anti - americanism has been attributed to nothing more than his bitter disappointment over failing a baseball tryout . we need not seek to understand the trivial , so such rumors serve to relieve us of the obligation of considering more complex social and political issues .
mixture	on 20 february 2017 , facebook user tiffany aikman published the a claim holding 179 children had gone missing in the state of indiana in the first 45 days of 2017 : <PARA> this claim circulated widely and caused considerable alarm , with commenters across facebook speculating that a “ serial killer ” or “ trafficking ring ” was responsible for what looked to be a massive uptick in abductions of minors . however , the information was not presented with any source data or other resource by which readers could contextualize or verify the claim that 179 minors had disappeared in a 45 - day span in indiana in 2017 . <PARA> the claim did not match a recent item published by indianapolis station wrtv just three days prior to aikman ’ s making her claim that 179 children had gone missing in indiana in the first 45 days of 2017 . wrtv reported that “[ as of publication date , ncmec had recorded ] 61 missing kids from the state of indiana dating back to 1979 ,” and “ in 2016 , 32 children were reported missing ... so far six have been added to this list from 2017 .” in other words , as of three days prior to the appearance of a facebook rumor claiming 179 kids had gone missing in a six - week period in 2017 in a single state , a local news outlet in that same state reported a total of six missing children were counted by the national center for missing & exploited children ( ncmec ) for all of 2017 in indiana . unless 173 children were abducted in the three - day span between that report and an alarming facebook post , it was highly unlikely the latter reflected statistical reality . <PARA> without source material , it was difficult to discern the metric by which anyone concluded 179 children “ went missing ” in the first 45 days on 2017 in indiana . commenters often surmised the 179 included “ runaways ” ( often in quotes , perhaps indicating disbelief all minors classed as runaways indeed left of their own volition ), but there was no reason to believe the total of six missing children provided by ncmec as of 17 february 2017 did not itself include runaways among their list of missing children . <PARA> we contacted the indiana state police to inquire about this claim , and the representative with whom we spoke was unaware of nearly 200 children going missing in indiana alone in the first several weeks of 2017 . ncmec advised us to contact the indiana clearinghouse for information on missing children and missing endangered adults , as a document titled “ missing children bulletin ” had been circulated in tandem with some versions of the rumor . <PARA> a representative with whom we spoke at that agency explained that the “ missing children bulletin ” included every single report of a minor received by law enforcement agencies across the state of indiana , even if those children were only briefly missing , and the vast majority of included reports involved runaways who returned home “ within days .” regarding the six children listed by wrtv on 17 february 2017 as having gone missing in indiana during the calendar year to date , the representative stated that most of those cases likely involved custodial interference ( when minors are removed from their homes by non - custodial relatives ). the representative noted that reports of missing children ( which are typically resolved quickly ) are often mistakenly confused by the public with relatively rare instances of “ stranger abductions .” statistics routinely demonstrate that “ only one - hundredth of 1 percent of all missing children ” are kidnapped by strangers , and that the most - recent “ comprehensive study ” as of 2013 “ estimated that the number was 115 in a year .” <PARA> although the “ missing children bulletin ” is updated daily and includes every police report received about a missing minor , most of those reports are resolved quickly , with as many as 10 , 000 such reports being tallied in indiana any given year . although it was very likely that 179 reports of missing children were received by various agencies in the state of indiana in the first 45 days of 2017 , the state ’ s clearinghouse for missing individuals said that almost all the reported missing minors were quickly accounted for .

mixture	authorities say a 13 - year - old alabama girl with special needs was beheaded after she saw her grandmother killed in a cemetery . <PARA> huntsville television station waff reported the details of a grisly crime which emerged at a preliminary hearing in a madison county court for 26 - year - old yoni aguilar , who , along with 34 - year - old israel palomino , is charged with two counts of capital murder in the june 2018 slayings of 49 - year - old oralia mendoza and her granddaughter , mariah lopez . <PARA> according to court testimony , in the days before the murder aguilar , palomino , mendoza , and mendoza ’ s friend laticia garcia went to georgia to pick up a large amount of drugs , and something that took place during the trip prompted palomino and mendoza to engage in an ultimately fatal argument . aguilar and palomino eventually drove the victims to a cemetery , where mendoza was fatally stabbed : <PARA> the suspects reportedly killed 13 - year - old mariah because she was a witness to the slaying of her grandmother , taking her to a secluded area where , aguilar claimed , palomino forced him to kill the girl : <PARA> the disreputable web site your news wire published an article on this subject headlined “ illegal immigrant beheads 13 - year - old girl in alabama — media blackout ,” which asserted that “ the mainstream media has failed to report on the barbaric crime ” because “ mainstream media outlets are now choosing to suppress horrific news stories involving illegal immigrants .” <PARA> however , the underlying crimes were in fact widely reported by multiple national u . s . news outlets , including fox news , the washington post , the associated press , and cox media group . <PARA> moreover , according to huntsville station waay , while aguilar was an undocumented immigrant , palomino was legally in the u . s . on a green card . since it ’ s as yet unclear what involvement each of the two men had in mariah lopez ’ s death , it cannot be definitively stated at this time that an “ illegal immigrant beheaded a 13 - year - old .”

false	a meme produced by the conservative turning point usa organization employed problematic logic and ignorance of factual events in order to reinforce its pro - gun argument . “ if guns kill people ,” the meme asks , “ how does anyone get out of a gun show alive ?” <PARA> if the argument is that people don ’ t die at places with lots of guns , that ’ s not true , as demonstrated by at least two high - profile incidents of accidental shootings , one at a gun show and another at a gun range : in 2008 , an 8 - year - old boy died after accidentally shooting himself in the head at a gun show in massachusetts . in 2014 , a 9 - year - old girl accidentally shot and killed her instructor at a gun range in arizona . <PARA> in addition , a number of gun - related deaths and injuries have occurred at gun shows proper , according to numerous news reports . among them , five people in three states were injured when weapons accidentally went off at gun shows in one day in january 2013 , while a man seriously injured himself outside an iowa gun show by accidentally shooting himself in 2018 . <PARA> a 2017 study by the university of california at berkeley found “ a nearly 70 percent increase in deaths and injuries from firearms in california communities within convenient driving distance of nevada gun shows .” the state of nevada “ has some of the least restrictive firearm laws in the country and no explicit regulations on gun shows ” whereas california “ has some of the strongest firearm laws in the country ,” per the study . <PARA> in other words , not only are the facts behind the meme incorrect , but the logic is flawed . the meme appears to be an effort to support the gun - advocate talking point , “ guns don ’ t kill people , people kill people .” the problem , however , is that gun shows are not just full of guns but also people . <PARA> so if people kill people , then logically one must ask : what would explain the purported lack of gun deaths at gun shows that the meme asserts ? furthermore , the berkeley study appears to show that the degree of violence associated with gun shows is dictated not by the presence of guns at those shows , but gun regulations in the states they are held in . we therefore rate this claim as “ false .”

false	the internet was at one juncture hopefully dubbed “ the information superhighway ,” but there are times ( and far too many of them ) that it might more accurately be referred to as “ the misinformation superhighway ,” given the apocrypha frequently spotted toddling along in the slow lane , its left indicator constantly signaling a lane change that never comes . even when its errors aren ’ t of the egregious variety , so often the new knowledge imparted to readers by the internet is woefully wrong . <PARA> so it is with the internet claim that the son of child - rearing expert dr . spock died by his own hand . that wasn ’ t the case ; both children of dr . benjamin spock are still alive , even though the doctor himself is no longer with us . dr . spock had two sons by his first marriage : michael , a museum director , and john , who studied architecture and became the owner of a construction company . ( the doctor ’ s first marriage ended in divorce after 48 years ; his second marriage of 22 years ended with his death in 1998 .) <PARA> the seed of this rumor was undoubtedly planted when dr . spock ’ s grandson peter took his own life on december 25 in 1983 by jumping from the roof of boston ’ s children ’ s museum . ( peter ’ s father , michael , was director of the museum , and peter himself worked there part - time while a student at university of massachusetts at boston .) the family has remained close - mouthed about what might have impelled the 22 - year - old to end it all , so the circumstances surrounding this young man ’ s decision remain murky . still , the choice of suicide location is curious , and one wonders if at least some of the burdens that overwhelmed young peter didn ’ t involve his relationship with his father . ( he jumped from the roof of the building where his father worked , and on christmas day at that — most assuredly those choices of location and timing would be read by anyone trying to ascertain the deceased ’ s state of mind as strong , deliberate statements . however , spock biographer thomas maier points out that peter had schizophrenia .) <PARA> suicides occur far more often than we would care to consider . this tragedy visits the homes of both the wealthy and the poor — it makes no distinctions , and fame , power , and influence are no magic talismans that can fend off this threat to one ’ s nearest and dearest . suicides take place in all manner of homes and in all manner of families , and the famous are doubly burdened when what would be a personal tragedy in any other household becomes fodder for media scrutiny ( as in the death of diane linkletter , daughter of television personality art linkletter .) <PARA> the confusion over who died in dr . spock ’ s family has been picked up and repeated widely because some choose to see this mistaken tidbit not only as compellingly ironic but as a telling condemnation of the doctor ’ s teachings . dr . spock ’ s book baby and child care was published in 1946 , just in time for the post - world war ii baby boom . it became the widely - accepted bible on child rearing , and much of the advice dr . spock offered therein ran against the grain of what had previously been the accepted standard for bringing up children . spock encouraged parents to treat their offspring with respect rather than arm themselves with leather belts put to use at the first sign of disobedience . this led some critics to call him the “ father of permissiveness ” even though he advocated disciplining one ’ s children , just not beating them . <PARA> the following snippet harvested from a 2002 embellishment of the 2001 remarks on the september 11 tragedy offered by the daughter of evangelist billy graham provides an example of the context in which this rumor is often promulgated : <PARA> in this instance , the fallacious ‘ son committed suicide ’ claim is used to support a position that dr . spock ’ s teachings were dangerously wrong and should be thrown out with the baby ’ s bathwater . “ how much of an expert could he have been ,” we ’ re supposed to muse , “ if his own son was driven to suicide ? maybe corporal punishment is the right way to go , seeing as how eschewing the belt led to that result .” <PARA> but whether spanking is ultimately helpful or harmful , neither of dr . spock ’ s sons killed himself . those who hold up the “ suicided son ” tidbit as their shining proof that the world went to hell in a handbasket because parents listened to wrongheaded experts rather than keeping faith with their sturdy sam brownes only make fools of themselves , because their example is wrong . <PARA> an ironic twist to this legend is that it is true about a psychologist who advocated a child - rearing approach diametrically opposed to the one dr . spock would later champion : <PARA> watson ’ s son , william , committed suicide at age 40 . ( a similar but apocryphal tale is attached to the child of another behavioralist , b . f . skinner .) <PARA> although the debate over the effectiveness of spanking children continues , dr . spock ’ s book baby and child care was a runaway success and remains a best - seller today . with over 50 million copies in print , it has become one of the world ’ s best selling non - fiction publications ( second only to the bible in that category ).

true	in december 2017 , disturbing reports surfaceed that police in crawford county , georgia had threatened to arrest a local man if he did not cut off his own dog ’ s head , purportedly for rabies testing , after officers fatally shot the animal . <PARA> we have received several inquiries about this story . it is true . <PARA> according to crawford county sheriff lewis walker , a sheriff ’ s deputy arrived at the home of joe nathan goodwin on the afternoon of 1 december 2017 , responding to a report that goodwin ’ s pit bull - type terrier big boy had bitten a neighbor . walker says the dog charged at the deputy , who then fatally shot him . <PARA> subsequently , investigator james hollis arrived at the scene and ordered goodwin to remove the dog ’ s head for the purpose of rabies testing . goodwin initially refused to comply , but later followed hollis ’ order . in a video recorded by goodwin and posted to facebook , hollis can clearly be heard saying : <PARA> in another video , hollis identifies himself as “ investigator hollis ” and expresses dissatisfaction with the way goodwin was purportedly talking to law enforcement before appearing to slam goodwin against a car . in yet another video , hollis can be heard threatening to arrest goodwin . <PARA> the following is clear from this video evidence : hollis , by his own admission , asked goodwin to cut off his own dog ’ s head ; that goodwin was reluctant to do so , and even outraged by the request ; that hollis threatened to arrest and charge goodwin with an unspecified criminal offense . given that goodwin was acting under threat of arrest , it is true to say that he was forced to remove his own dog ’ s head . <PARA> crawford county sheriff lewis walker told local news outlet wmaz that the incident is under investigation , and that hollis had been placed on administrative leave . walker added that any rabies diagnosis should have been handled by the local health department , not responding police officers : <PARA> the crawford county sheriff ’ s department sent us a copy of the incident report in this case , which indicates that a local health official told hollis by telephone that there were two options : either goodwin had to remove the dog ’ s head himself , or he could transport the animal to a veterinarian , who could perform the procedure . <PARA> despite this , according to the report , the health official subsequently told goodwin he would have to cut off the dog ’ s head himself , apparently without presenting the second option . <PARA> proper protocol was not followed in this incident , a spokesperson for the state of georgia ’ s department of public health told the telegraph newspaper in macon , georgia :

unproven	in october 2014 , a rumor started circulating online that a gmo corn field in ontario , canada , was the cause of more than 37 million bee deaths . while it is true millions of bees were found to have died around that time in canada , the cause of those deaths has not been definitively linked to gmo corn . <PARA> the rumor started after organichealth . com published an article titled 37 million bees found dead in ontario , canada after planting large gmo corn field : <PARA> the organic health article was basically a repurposed version of two articles published by the post in june 2013 and cbc news in august 2013 . neither of those articles mentioned gmo corn . <PARA> in fact , the organic health article never truly blamed gmo corn for killing millions of bees . other than the title and the first sentence , organic health steered away from the idea that a gmo corn field caused 37 million bees to die in canada and instead aligned with the conclusions drawn by the post and cbc news : the culprit behind the devastating bee deaths in canada is believed to be neonicotinoid pesticides : “ what seems to be deadly to bees is that the neonicotinoid pesticides are coating corn seed and with the use of new air seeders , are blowing the pesticide dust into the air when planted .” <PARA> while the idea that gmo corn is causing millions of bees to perish around the world is intriguing , it is also unproven . the same could be said for neonicotinoid pesticides , of course , but the evidence is starting to tip towards the latter . the pest management regulatory agency ( pmra ), an arm of health canada that regulates pesticides , investigated the bee death incident in ontario and found that neonicotinoids were likely to blame : <PARA> the ontario beekeeper ’ s association , which claims that ontario has seen a 35 % decrease in honey bees over the last two years , recently started a petition calling for a provincial ban on neonicotinoids :

false	origins : shortly after the chipotle mexican grill dining chain removed pork from the menus of about a third of its restaurants in early january 2015 , a rumor started claiming the chain had made the decision in order to appease the muslim community . hundreds of angry customers took to social media , accusing the restaurant of bowing to “ sharia law ”: <PARA> however , according to chipotle spokesman chris arnold , the decision to temporarily take pork off some menus had nothing to do with religion ; it was made because the company discovered one its pork suppliers was violating the restaurant ’ s livestock - housing rules . <PARA> this is fundamentally an animal - welfare decision and is rooted in our unwillingness to compromise our standards . <PARA> conventionally raised pigs generally do not have access to the outdoors , spend their lives in densely crowded buildings , live on hard , slatted floors with no ability to root and are given antibiotics to keep them from getting sick . we would rather not serve pork at all than serve pork from animals raised in that way . <PARA> conventionally raised pigs generally do not have access to the outdoors , spend their lives in densely crowded buildings , live on hard , slatted floors with no ability to root and are given antibiotics to keep them from getting sick . we would rather not serve pork at all than serve pork from animals raised in that way . <PARA> the restaurant chain has also communicated via twitter about its reasons for removing pork from some menus : <PARA> on its web site , chipotle states in a section called “ food with integrity ” it has strict guidelines for its pork suppliers . the restaurant gets pork only from suppliers who “ naturally raise ” their pigs . this means the pigs are raised outdoors or in deeply bedded pens , are fed a vegetarian diet , and are not given antibiotics . chipotle has been following these guidelines since 2001 : <PARA> many pigs are raised on factory farms and kept in small pens that do not allow for freedom of movement , limiting their ability to express natural behaviors . these pigs are given large amounts of subtherapeutic antibiotics to keep them from getting sick and enhance growth . according to the union of concerned scientists , american pork producers use over 10 million pounds of antibiotics per year to keep their confinement - raised pigs from getting sick . that ’ s more than three times the estimated amount used to treat all human illness . <PARA> we choose to buy our pork from farmers who do things differently . <PARA> there are farmers whose pigs are raised outside or in deeply bedded pens , are never given antibiotics and are fed a vegetarian diet . it ’ s the way animals were raised before huge factory farms changed the industry . we believe pigs that are cared for in this way enjoy happier , healthier lives and produce the best pork we ’ ve ever tasted . <PARA> we call this style of farming and ranching naturally raised , and since 2001 , chipotle has sourced 100 % of our pork from producers who follow these guidelines . <PARA> we choose to buy our pork from farmers who do things differently . <PARA> there are farmers whose pigs are raised outside or in deeply bedded pens , are never given antibiotics and are fed a vegetarian diet . it ’ s the way animals were raised before huge factory farms changed the industry . we believe pigs that are cared for in this way enjoy happier , healthier lives and produce the best pork we ’ ve ever tasted . <PARA> we call this style of farming and ranching naturally raised , and since 2001 , chipotle has sourced 100 % of our pork from producers who follow these guidelines .
true	dock phillip ellis , best remembered as the winningest pitcher on the champion 1971 pittsburgh pirates baseball club , was also one of his sport ’ s more colorful personalities , although his exploits were generally overshadowed by those of players ( curt flood , richie allen , reggie jackson ) more talented and more controversial . ellis ’ intolerance for slights which he perceived to be related to the color of his skin was well - established long before he reached the major leagues ( he declined to play on his high school ’ s baseball team because it was coached by a “ racist ,” and while in the minor leagues he once took a bat into the stands in pursuit of a racially - motivated heckler ), and he was the subject of several headline - grabbing altercations during his prime years in the big leagues : <PARA> but , oddly enough , the most notorious aspect of dock ellis ’ playing days wasn ’ t disclosed until several years after he had retired , and it involved an accomplishment that is usually the highlight of any pitcher ’ s career . <PARA> on 12 june 1970 , ellis hurled the first no - hitter of the 1970 season as he blanked the padres 2 - 0 in the opening game of a double - header in san diego . ellis ’ feat was a bit unusual in that he seemed particularly wild that day , walking eight batters and hitting one , but many pitchers have achieved stellar results despite laboring with obvious control problems . ( yankee hurler bill bevens came within one out of throwing a no - hitter against brooklyn in the fourth game of the 1947 world series despite issuing the dodgers an astounding ten bases on balls .) in post - game interviews ellis said he had been thinking about a no - hitter from the fourth inning onward and attributed his wildness to his efforts to keep the ball away from hitters : “ i know guys who don ’ t want to talk about it , but if you ’ re going to throw [ a no - hitter ], you ’ re going to throw it . the ball i was throwing was moving . i was keeping the ball away from the hitters . that ’ s why i walked so many .” <PARA> fourteen years later , however , dock ellis revealed an alternative explanation for his lack of control that day : he was under the influence of lsd at the time . according to accounts he gave the press in april 1984 , ellis had spent the morning of 12 june 1970 relaxing in his home town of los angeles , under the mistaken belief that the pirates had the day off . ellis said he ingested lsd around noon , but at about 1 : 00 pm his girlfriend picked up a newspaper and discovered that not only were the pirates scheduled to play a double - header in san diego that evening , but ellis was slated to start the first game for pittsburgh . ellis ’ companion hustled him off to the airport by 3 : 30 pm and got him on a flight to san diego , where arrived at 4 : 30 pm , in time for the double - header ’ s 6 : 05 pm start . <PARA> ellis told reporters he remembered little of what took place during the game itself : <PARA> any assignment of a “ true ” status to this story must be a guarded one : only dock ellis knows whether or not he actually took lsd the day he pitched his no - hitter , and even if he did ingest lsd that day , judging the extent to which the drug ( which can affect different people in different ways ) was affecting him by the time he took part in that evening ’ s game is problematic . baseball is a difficult game to play at the major league level , even for skilled professionals free from the effects of mind - altering substances , yet ellis managed to pitch a complete game that evening , apparently did not act so unusually that his teammates or manager took notice , and was quite lucid while conducting post - game interviews with the press . ( of course , since it ’ s a long - standing baseball superstition that players should avoid speaking to a teammate who is in the midst of pitching a no - hitter , the other pirates likely had little or no interaction with ellis in the dugout during the latter half of the game .) although ellis might correctly be described as having been “ under the influence of lsd ” during his no - hitter , quite possibly the drug ’ s primary effects had peaked and were wearing off by game time . <PARA> dock ellis ’ recollections are also somewhat questionable . donald hall ’ s 1976 biography , dock ellis in the country of baseball , initially stated that ellis had been drinking ( vodka ) before his no - hitter . ellis maintained that he never pitched again while under the influence of lsd after his 1970 no - hitter , but he later said he had also taken the drug before the 1974 cincinnati game in which he intentionally threw at the first several batters . and that admission came after he had previously stated that he took “ pep pills ,” not lsd , before that 1974 game . then he said in 1985 that he “ never pitched a game in the major leagues i wasn ’ t high .” <PARA> an unfortunate aspect of dock ellis ’ admission is that he is now remembered by many people ( especially those too young to have seen him play during his heyday with the pirates ) as “ the guy who pitched a no - hitter on drugs ,” a characterization which not only slights a baseball career that included some very fine moments , but also obscures the many acts of charity and conscience in which ellis engaged both during and after his playing days : he worked with the pennsylvania department of corrections to rehabilitate black prisoners , helped start the black athletes foundation for sickle cell research , and served as the coordinator of an anti - drug program in los angeles before passing away from liver disease in 2008 .
mixture	the day after thanksgiving is the day millions of americans , enjoying a rare friday off ( and a dearth of football games on television ), head for the malls to kick off the christmas shopping season . “ black friday ” ( supposedly so named because it ’ s the day when retailers turn the corner and see their income statements move out of the red and into the black , but originally the phrase was a derisive term applied by police and retail workers to the day ’ s plethora of traffic jams and badly - behaved customers ) is regularly cited as “ the busiest shopping day of the year .” but although black friday may be the day the greatest number of holiday shoppers traipse through malls , it isn ’ t necessarily the biggest day of the year in terms of dollars spent : <PARA> previous holiday shopping trends showed sales figures spiking on the day after thanksgiving before suffering a sharp decline through the end of november . however , sales would steadily increase throughout december , peaking on the four days comprising the two weekends before christmas . as a result , black friday sales almost always ranked below the last saturday before christmas ( or december 23 , if christmas day falls on a weekend ). up until 2002 it ranked between fourth and eighth on charts of the year ’ s busiest shopping days . <PARA> according to statistics published by the international council of shopping centers ( icsc ), the top shopping days for the years 1993 through 2002 were : <PARA> during that period , “ black friday ” held the following positions in the icsc ’ s rankings of year ’ s busiest shopping days : <PARA> holiday shopping patterns changed in the following years as more shoppers began using on - line sales outlets for their holiday purchases .

false	examples : [ collected via e - mail , july 2012 ] <PARA> origins : debate over the enaction of voter id laws in the united states has been a prominent political issue over the last several years . proponents of such laws maintain that enhanced regulations requiring voters to display current and valid ( photo ) identification prior to casting ballots are necessary to prevent widespread voter fraud and ensure the integrity of the election process . opponents maintain that actual instances of voter fraud are rare and that such laws only serve to disenfranchise many legitimate voters who , although eligible to vote , have difficulty meeting the enhanced id requirements . ( currently , thirty states require prospective voters to produce some form of photo or non - photo identification prior to their casting ballots .) <PARA> one of the arguments mustered by opponents of voter id laws is the fact that prior to world war ii , it was quite common for women in the <PARA> u . s . to give birth <PARA> at home rather than in hospitals . under those circumstances , the process of recording a birth and obtaining state certification of it was often delayed ( rather than occurring within a day or two of the event , as it typically is now ), and in many cases no paperwork was ever filed at all , particularly in states that had not yet enacted requirements for mandatory registration of birth certificates . thus , quite a few people born in the pre - war era may not ever have been issued official birth certificates , documentation which is now generally the starting place for obtaining state - issued photo identification of the type that might be required under voter id laws . <PARA> one example of this argument being proffered on the internet in july 2012 was that ronald reagan , the two - term governor of california and president of the united states , was born at home ( in 1911 ) and didn ’ t receive his birth certificate until 1991 , and therefore he would have been unable to vote for most of his life under current voter id laws . an image of reagan ’ s birth certificate bearing a 20 june 1991 date stamp was used to bolster this claim : <PARA> like many people , especially older african americans in the south , ronald reagan was born at home and never received a birth certificate . <PARA> in most states today it is required to show a birth certificate in order to recieve [ sic ] an id from the dmv . ronald reagan did not have one until 1991 . <PARA> the problem with this specific example is that the 20 june 1991 stamp doesn ’ t reflect the date on which ronald reagan ’ s birth certificate was first issued ; it merely reflects the date on which the illinois division of vital records fulfilled reagan ’ s request to provide him with a certified copy of that document . reagan had asked for a copy of his birth certificate at that time so that it could be displayed among the other childhood and professional career artifacts of his life at the ronald reagan presidential library and center for public affairs in simi valley , california , which opened later that year . the document itself is clearly dated in two different places — alongside the signatures of the doctor who attended his birth and the state registrar — as having been created in august 1942 .

true	on 14 december 2016 , a video purportedly showing a driverless uber running a red light in san francisco appeared and was quickly circulated on social media : <PARA> according to the san francisco examiner , the footage was taken by a dashboard camera of a luxor cab : <PARA> while the video does show an uber vehicle driving through a red light , it was not initially clear whether the vehicle was self - driven at the time . the cameras at the top of the vehicle indicate that it is capable of operating without a driver , but such vehicles can still be driven by humans . <PARA> uber said in a statement to techcrunch that the incident was unequivocally due to human error : <PARA> later in the afternoon of 14 december 2016 , the state of california ’ s department of motor services ordered uber to halt its self - driving car rides , effective immediately , as its “ autonomous vehicles ” were operating without the proper permits : <PARA> it came out a few months later by way of a report from the new york times that although uber had said this traffic violation was due to “ human error ,” the vehicle was , in fact , driving itself at the time of the incident . the newspaper spoke to two anonymous employees and viewed internal company documents which stated that uber ’ s mapping program failed to recognize not one , but six traffic lights in san francisco : <PARA> in march 2018 , a self - driving uber hit and killed a woman in arizona . the company pulled its self - driving vehicles off the roads shortly after the incident .

false	examples : <PARA> aids was a chemical experiment sponsored by the cia that went awry . <PARA> [ collected on the internet , 1994 ] <PARA> american scientists created aids in a laboratory as a weapon to be used on enemies of the united states , and they began testing it on unsuspecting populations in africa and haiti , where they lost control of the experiment . <PARA> [ turner , 1993 ] <PARA> apparently the cia was testing to find a disease which would resist any cures known to man . they did this testing somewhere in africa . the purpose of finding this incurable disease was to bring america back to the old days of the moral majority . therefore this disease was to be transmitted sexually among the outcasts of society , namely people of color and gay men . <PARA> origins : the ghastly disease aids burst upon the scene in the early 1980s . though this particular grim reaper has not long stalked among us , it has taken millions of lives and has staked its cold - fingered claim to millions more . that it seemed to appear out of nowhere has sparked a multitude of rumors regarding its origin and path of destruction . rumors about aids include claims that it was : <PARA> scientists are generally agreed that aids jumped the species barrier from chimpanzees to humans . ( chimpanzees host a virus called siv , simian immunodeficiency virus , which is regarded as being similar to hiv .) aids is not the only new contagion to have begun in such fashion ; ebola and marburg , two infectious diseases that kill incredible numbers of those who contract them , were passed to humans from monkeys . <PARA> it ’ s a simple explanation : diseases live on by finding victims to infect , and diseases that jump species ( sometimes undergoing changes in the process ) find a whole new set of victims available to them . yet this is too pat an explanation for many of us , and we tend to reject that which doesn ’ t fit well to our understanding of our world , substituting in its place myths that , although disturbing , at least seem more logical . we make <PARA> the arrogant assumption that our world should always make sense according to our current level of knowledge ; such a premise works well in most cases but breaks down in the face of matters our understanding does not yet encompass . at those moments at least some of us scramble to find explanations — any explanations — that can be shoehorned into service . <PARA> that a death - dealing plague could spring into being during our lifetimes defiles our cherished sense of order : deadly diseases don ’ t just come from nowhere , after all , at least not according to our understanding of the way of things . we ’ ve also grown to trust that science always has the answer for everything . that this pestilence could defy the efforts of our best healers and researchers strikes us as flat - out wrong . surely a natural malady would have been cured by now ; ergo , we conclude , aids must be manmade . the disease ’ s sudden appearance and its tenacity have laid a foundation for rumors about biochemical pathogens that escaped the laboratory by accident and supported whispers that the virus was engineered to wipe out specific ethnic or racial groups . it is , after all , far more comforting to believe in malevolent forces like the cia than to grasp that nature could spontaneously create incurable diseases . <PARA> rumors about lab experiments gone wrong or deliberate attempts to decimate certain groups are part of our struggle to come to terms with the unfathomable , to reduce it to something that can be comprehended and dealt with . also , the aids origin stories we tell give us someone to blame , providing us with the comfort of a whipping boy in place of the terror inherent to “ it just happened ; there was no because to it .” the acknowledgement that something so deadly could “ just happen ” is a starkly unforgiving reality that arrives accompanied by its chilling yet unstated companion message of “ something similar could happen again , maybe even tomorrow , and maybe even to us .” aids origin rumors reflect both western society ’ s anxiety about this dread killer and its attempts to make sense of it . <PARA> aids origin rumors fall into two categories : biological warfare experiments tried out on groups deemed expendable ( africans or haitians ) or deliberate attempts to diminish particular “ unfavorable ” populations ( africans , haitians , homosexuals ) via biochemical attack . in her study of aids origin lore , folklorist patricia turner identified a number of recurring motifs in the hundreds of versions of the rumor she collected : <PARA> that the first victims of aids were members of groups some deemed contemptible ( homosexuals and drug users ) supported belief that the disease had been deliberately manufactured for the purpose of ridding society of particular classes of undesirables . we now know aids is a blood - borne virus , but that knowledge was not in place when this new plague first began to take lives . in retrospect , it makes sense that the initial victims of aids would have been drawn largely from those two groups , but at the time the mechanism through which the disease spread was a mystery , a <PARA> condition that led some to latch onto a commonality between the two prevalent victim groups and accept an explanation based on that commonality . likewise , those whose religious or moral bents led them to conclude homosexuals and drug users were abominations in the eyes of god looked not to the cia as authors of the virus but to the creator , seeing aids as a deliberate act by a fed - up deity to rid himself of those who had broken his laws . <PARA> part of the prevalence of the aids origin rumor that pins responsibility for the virus on the cia ( or another group within the american government ) may be due to deliberate soviet misinformation designed to discredit the usa . an article charging aids was the product of u . s . germ warfare experiments first surfaced in the soviet newspaper literary gazette in 1985 and claimed the aids virus was created at a supersecret army research laboratory in fort detrick , maryland . the only source cited was the patriot , a leftist indian newspaper that , u . s . experts charged , was a favored conduit of the kgb for its disinformation campaigns . <PARA> in 1986 at a summit held in zimbabwe , what purported to be a scholarly paper linking the u . s . military with aids was widely circulated . the authors did not have any expertise in aids research , but their offering was taken somewhat seriously by many who read it . the paper charged the disease had been introduced into africa from europe — not through homosexual practices or intravenous drug use , but by tainted blood supplies , which may have originated in the u . s . its conclusion was unambiguous : aids was let loose on the world by biological warfare experimenters at fort detrick . that the rumor might well have been deliberately formulated by a foreign government at odds with the usa was an interesting curiosity . <PARA> barbara “ on the cold war path ” mikkelson
unproven	last week , the home owners had a pool service come in to drain and clean the pool . they found the body at the bottom of the pool with the pillow case filled with their valuables . just goes to show you , there is some justice out there . <PARA> or , as my mother would say ... <PARA> ‘ be sure your sins will find you out .’ <PARA> origins : one <PARA> popular genre of urban legendry is the “ just deserts ” tale , in which the criminal who preys on citizens and their <PARA> property is caught and punished — not just through ordinary police work , but because he is tripped up by his own greed , arrogance , or foolishness . after natural disasters that result in widespread loss of life and property , however , this type of legend takes a darker turn , and the punishment meted out to the lawbreaker correspondingly increases from capture to death . the last few major earthquakes in california , for example , have spurred versions of this type in which a car thief meets his maker when a section of freeway collapses atop him as he attempts to make off with a purloined vehicle . <PARA> the example cited above , coming in the wake of august 2005 ’ s hurricane katrina , presents all the same elements of those earlier earthquake tales : a natural disaster , a thief who helps himself to someone else ’ s valuables , a criminal done in by the dynamic duo of mother nature and greed , and a corpse not found until well after the fatal event . in this case , just like the fable of the man ( or monkey ) who cannot extricate his hand from a jar until he lets go of the desired goods contained therein , the looter ’ s plunder weighs him down and traps him at the <PARA> bottom of a flood - submerged pool — only this time there is no easy escape , and the thief perishes by drowning . ( the reference to <PARA> “ brothers ” also suggests the looter was black and thereby introduces an element of race found in other katrina - related <PARA> legends .) <PARA> unless some key element is missing from this account ( such as the looter ’ s pillowcase full of booty was tied securely to him or stuffed into a backpack strapped around his body ), this scenario doesn ’ t sound plausible as a real - life event , as the thief could simply have let go the sack of valuables and floated free . we also note that this scenario is so timeworn that it was mentioned in a 1945 collection of “ tired and tiresome plots which constantly turn up on editors ’ desks ”: <PARA> ( 30 ) a man on the verge of starvation with some companions in a desert shoots his friends and takes what little food remains . all is well for a time . unfortunately , in attempting to find his way to a settlement he becomes lost . for days he fights for his life . he plunges through the hot sand without losing hope . on the twentieth day , near sundown , he sees signs of human beings . he gropes his way toward them and finds — that he is back where he started . <PARA> ( 31 ) the same story as the one just outlined , except that the killer is so loaded with gold that when he flops accidentally into a pool of water or a wild river he cannot swim . the gold pulls him down , and he drowns . <PARA> ( 31 ) the same story as the one just outlined , except that the killer is so loaded with gold that when he flops accidentally into a pool of water or a wild river he cannot swim . the gold pulls him down , and he drowns . <PARA> ( the same basic plot shows up in literature well before the 20th century , as a similar fate also befalls dunstan cass , a character in george eliot ’ s 1861 novel silas marner , who steals marner ’ s gold but then falls into an abandoned quarry and drowns , with his body remaining undiscovered until years later .) <PARA> but of course , what ’ s important here ( in a folkloric sense ) is not the anecdote ’ s truthfulness , but the moral it expresses : had the crook not taken advantage of others ’ misfortune and made off with their property , he wouldn ’ t have lost his life . no one relishes the thought of being victimized in a crime , and compounding that distaste is the knowledge that all too often the perpetrators get away with their misdeeds . but in these legends , at least , the wrong - doers are brought to justice by their criminal actions .

false	amid an ongoing public debate over protests by national football league players over social and racial injustice , a report emerged in october 2017 that four black players had given the league a “ sick ultimatum ,” in an effort to “ force white fans ” to engage in community activism . <PARA> on 22 october 2017 , the freedom daily web site published an article claiming : <PARA> the article is centered around a memo reportedly sent to nfl commissioner roger goodell by four players : philadelphia eagles safety malcolm jenkins and wide receiver torrey smith ; seattle seahawks defensive end michael bennett ; and former buffalo bills and baltimore ravens wide receiver anquan boldin . <PARA> in september 2017 , yahoo ! sports published what appears to be an authentic copy of the memo . however , freedom daily ’ s description of it is grossly inaccurate and falsely claims that the four men gave the nfl an “ ultimatum ” ( they did not ), made demands ( they did not ), and that those demands related to fans ( the memo did not once mention fans ). <PARA> jenkins , smith , bennett , and boldin wrote to goodell to request ( not demand ) that the commissioner and the league lend their support to a coalition of players interested in community relations and activism , particularly in the areas of criminal justice reform and engagement with police . <PARA> specifically , the players suggested that the nfl could take part in visits to prisons , meetings with legislators on the state and national level , interviews and op - eds , engagement with nonprofit and grassroots organizations , and so on . <PARA> the four players did request that the nfl dedicate the month of november to such activities , but asked that it serve as “ a month of unity ” and community relations , in order to move the broader debate away from the national anthem protests . <PARA> at no point in the memo published by yahoo ! sports do the four players threaten goodell , offer an ultimatum , or even allude to negative consequences in the event of his inaction or failure to support their efforts . <PARA> similarly , the memo contains no mention of fans ( white or otherwise ), or any obligations or expectations being placed on fans by the nfl . therefore the two central claims in the freedom daily article are entirely false . <PARA> freedom daily is a disreputable web site with a long history of sensationalist , inflammatory , and inaccurate reporting .
mixture	i would like to relate what happened to me last night so that all , especially females can be aware of what has happened at several quiktrips in the past week . i was at the qt at maize and kellogg at 7 : 10pm . after i filled my car with gas and was locking my door to go into the store to buy a drink , i was approached by two men , one in front of me and one in back of me , demanding money . i said i had none . at that point the man in front grabbed my arms , insulted me and grabbed my keys from my hand . thank the lord the clerks in the store noticed something wrong and called the police . at the same time a man in a truck entered the gas pump next to me . he was very cognizant of what was happening and asked me if i needed help . this scared off the two men . they took off with my keys still in hand . the man in the truck chased them and did get my keys after they were thrown down . when the police arrived i was told that this had happened several times in the past week . others had their cars and purses stolen . i wanted to let you know what happened so you will be careful . be aware of your surroundings and listen to your gut feelings . i kept telling myself to yell or run back into the store , but my body wouldn ’ t respond . be careful , be safe and thank god that i was lucky enough to get out of this situation .” <PARA> origins : the <PARA> e - mail quoted above describes an incident that supposedly took place on 22 january 2008 at a quiktrip ( qt ) gas station / convenience store in wichita , kansas . according to the e - mail , a female customer was accosted at the qt ’ s gas pumps by two men who demanded money , grabbed her car keys , and presumably would have made off with her automobile had another customer not scared them off and chased them down . police summoned to the scene allegedly stated that several similar incidents had taken place during the previous week . <PARA> the wichita police department looked into the matter after someone forwarded them a copy of the message and found that no 911 calls from the named convenience store had been logged on the date in question , and clerks on duty at the store that evening were unaware of any such incident ’ s having occurred there ( on that date or any other ). the wichita police , through additional investigation , located the woman who was the victim in the described incident , and they learned from her that although something similar to the account quoted above did take place , it was an unreported , isolated incident , and the e - mailed description of it was not written by her — it was a second - hand report created and mailed by someone else who incorporated some misunderstandings into it : <PARA> as a result of the investigating officer ’ s interview with the woman who reported she was the victim in this incident , an incident report was initiated . as is standard procedure , the case was assigned to a detective for follow - up . as a result of that detective ’ s investigation , we have since learned : <PARA> the woman , whose english is quite broken , was indeed approached by two men at the quiktrip . a man in a pickup truck was able to chase the man who stole the woman ’ s keys . another man pulled up in a white car whom the woman mistakenly thought was a police officer and told her such events happen all the time . the woman then went home without reporting the incident . she relayed the information to another person who in turn created and sent the email which you received . <PARA> the woman , whose english is quite broken , was indeed approached by two men at the quiktrip . a man in a pickup truck was able to chase the man who stole the woman ’ s keys . another man pulled up in a white car whom the woman mistakenly thought was a police officer and told her such events happen all the time . the woman then went home without reporting the incident . she relayed the information to another person who in turn created and sent the email which you received . <PARA> in short , an incident similar to the one described did take place , but convenience store robberies like this one are not known to be a commonplace occurrence in wichita .
unproven	in the days before cable tv ( and the myriad other entertainments that have since sprung up to sap our attention ), the networks reigned supreme in the television industry . landing a series in the prime time line - up of one of the “ big three ” ( cbs , nbc , and abc ), where competition was fierce for the few slots that opened up each year , was a tv producer ’ s ultimate achievement . keeping his series on the air after having secured a network spot for it was a tv producer ’ s next greatest achievement . <PARA> it was with justifiable pride , then , that gene roddenberry found himself considering ways to enhance the popularity of his new star trek series in september 1966 . after years of planning and effort ( including the unusual circumstance of his having to produce two separate pilots with two different casts ), roddenberry had managed to convince nbc to take a chance on something outside the usual tried - and - true westerns and family sitcoms that dominated network schedules : a non - anthology science fiction series set on a space ship three hundred years in the future . <PARA> the chances of landing such a show with a network had been slim ; the chances of keeping it there were even slimmer . so it ’ s no wonder that after only two episodes of star trek had been aired , its creator / producer was already thinking ahead its next season . with an eye towards higher ratings , roddenberry wrote a memo to casting director joe d ’ agosta on 22 september 1966 which said : <PARA> if the wording and date of this memo are accurate , roddenberry was prescient indeed . by 22 september 1966 , the monkees ( which , like star trek , was never much a ratings winner during its original run ) had aired but two episodes , both of which had lost their time slot in the viewership contest to gilligan ’ s island . and “ last train to clarksville ,” the monkees ’ first record , had yet to crack the top 40 on billboard ’ s singles chart . roddenberry must have been following the television industry ( and the teen market ) quite keenly to have caught on to davy jones ’ nascent popularity so quickly . <PARA> the new character roddenberry suggested did show up during star trek ‘ s second season in 1967 - 68 in the person of an ensign serving as the ship ’ s navigator and junior science officer , as portrayed by actor walter koenig . the character ’ s beatlesque / monkeesque origins were demonstrated by the “ mop - top ” wig placed atop koenig ’ s head for his first few episodes until his own hair grew out to a suitable length . ( as william shatner recalled , “ the rather bushy toupee he was forced to wear will illustrate the monkee mimicry point beyond a shadow of a doubt .” and koenig himself complained that “ swallows kept trying to nest in the wig they gave me .”) however , rather than employing a manchester accent similar to davy jones ’, koenig ’ s character affected an eastern european accent , one that went with the character ’ s name : pavel chekov . so what happened to the “ english - accent type ” roddenberry had so eagerly spoken of adding to the cast a year earlier ? herb solow , the vice president of production at desilu studios , where star trek was produced , later explained : <PARA> this was the same explanation of chekov ’ s origins that had been offered in the roddenberry - vetted book the making of star trek , published back when the series was still in production : <PARA> thst circumstance explains chekov ’ s transformation from an englishman to a russian quite nicely . or does it ? <PARA> did pravda really run an editorial critical of star trek ‘ s lack of russian crew members ? it seems rather unlikely , given that star trek didn ’ t air in the soviet union during its original run , and the decidedly pro - american cold war allegories that furnished the plots for numerous episodes of the series weren ’ t exactly the sort of material the soviets would have wanted to be associated with . moreover , evidently nobody associated with star trek ever saw the alleged editorial — everyone merely heard about it from someone else . roddenberry himself said he hadn ’ t seen the editorial ; he claimed he had been told about it by one of the show ’ s actors around the end of 1966 . ( roddenberry didn ’ t identify which actor told him this , but it ’ s doubtful that anyone in the star trek cast would have been reading pravda .) if roddenberry truly wondered why nobody in moscow answered his letter , perhaps it was because they had no idea what he was talking about ? <PARA> william shatner ( or his ghostwriter ) wrote the whole thing off as a publicity stunt in his book of reminiscences about the show , star trek memories : <PARA> what to believe ? roddenberry was famous for his myth - making , so this tale certainly sounds like something he could have made up . william shatner , star of the series , claimed it was a public relations stunt , but we wouldn ’ t necessarily give his word too much credence : actors aren ’ t necessarily privy to off - the - set dealings , and shatner likely was merely repeating something he heard second - hand long after the fact . <PARA> however , apparently there is at least something to the pravda story , as the 1996 book inside star trek : the real story ( by desilu executive herb solow and star trek associate producer robert justman ) reproduces a 1967 letter from gene roddenberry on star trek letterhead to the editor of pravda , informing the latter of chekov ’ s addition to the cast . unless the letter was a latter - day forgery created to lend support to a publicity stunt , it would indicate that roddenberry at least believed pravda had run such an editorial , whether they genuinely did or not . <PARA> all of this conflicting information makes it difficult to assign a “ true ” or “ false ” status to the claim stated at the top of this page . in a strict sense , one could say it isn ’ t true that the chekov character was added to the star trek cast because of a editorial in pravda ( whether or not such an editorial was ever actually published ), since gene roddenberry had already been thinking about creating a part for “ monkees - like ” actor in the show . however , one might impart some truth to the claim in the sense that roddenberry ’ s belief that pravda had run such an editorial might have influenced his decision to make the new character ’ s nationality russian rather than british . on the other hand , one might maintain the claim is literally false , since there is no evidence ( other than hearsay ) that pravda ever published an editorial critical of star trek ‘ s lack of soviet crew members . <PARA> our estimation is that the story about pravda was not cooked up as a publicity stunt , due to the simple fact that it wasn ’ t publicized at the time . the account of how the chekov character was added to the star trek crew to put those complaining soviets in their place wasn ’ t trumpeted in the media at the time it supposedly happened — as far as we can tell , it was only mentioned in the book the making of star trek ( not exactly a best - seller ) over a year after chekov ’ s debut , hardly a timely or effective way of creating buzz with a cooked - up pr invention . we doubt pravda actually did run an editorial about star trek , but we also doubt that even gene roddenberry would have forged a back - dated letter to support the claim that they did , so we think it likely he genuinely believed they had . how much any of this might have influenced roddenberry ’ s decision to make the added star trek character played by walter koenig a russian , we can ’ t tell at this remove .

( a 2010 article provides an account of a dog that had to be euthanized after being injured in such a manner .) <PARA> appallingly , such tragedies are not limited to the realm of the accidental , as plenty of examples can be found of miscreants ’ taking perverse delight in inserting explosives into various orifices of live animals . such is the claim associated with the photograph displayed above , which is said to depict a dog injured by kids ’ forcibly placing fireworks into its mouth , and which , sadly , appears to be true . <PARA> the picture corresponds to a series of photos posted on facebook in mid - november 2011 which are listed as being taken in sarajevo , bosnia and herzegovina , and depict a mutilated german shepherd identified as vucko , and it ’ s also similar to a series of photos published in mid - november 2011 on a bosnian web site that described them with the following ( roughly translated ) statement : <PARA> human cruelty to animals , unfortunately , day by day is getting worse , and cruelty was once again demonstrated on friday in the sarajevo suburb of ilidza where unknown perpetrators put fireworks in the mouth of a dog , who suffered very serious injuries for which he was allegedly put to sleep by veterinarians . <PARA> the social action network care2 also reported the following backstory about vucko : <PARA> two drunken teenagers in bosnia decided to have “ fun ” by duct - taping a firework in a german shepherd ’ s mouth and blowing off his face . having done this , they took off , leaving the helpless creature to suffer . the poor dog , known as vucko , apparently wandered in agony for five days , unable to eat . finally , he was picked up by authorities and taken to a vetenarian ’ s office , but had to be euthanized after vets were unable to perform reconstructive surgery . <PARA> vucko ’ s case prompted the creation of a petition seeking the passage of animal cruelty legislation in bosnia .
false	examples : [ collected via e - mail and facebook , june 2015 ] <PARA> origins : the growing encroachment of social media into every area of life hasn ’ t necessarily led to a rise in foolish teenage behavior , but it does seem to be fueling misguided parental ideas about how teenagers conspire to spend their free time . <PARA> the idea that dangerous social media challenges are popular seems to be on the upswing . the ice bucket challenge of mid - 2014 may well have inspired the increase in social media challenge fads ; but parental fears of largely non - existent practices such as “ rainbow parties ,” vodka - infused tampons , bedbug smoking , and ‘ beezin preceded it . <PARA> in 2015 , anxious parents feared that the paracetamol challenge would inspire their children to overdose on over - the - counter painkillers ; and in the same vein , the 72 - hour challenge ( also known as the “ game of 72 ”) prompted concerns that kids were participating in a pointless and dangerous social media fad . <PARA> in april 2015 , the daily mail published a thinly - sourced article titled “ parents left terrified by cruel new ‘ game ’ on facebook that sees children dare each other to vanish for 72 hours without telling relatives .” as with other panics of similar nature , the article breathlessly described a “ game ” that sounded of no real interest to teens whatsoever and included scant evidence that participants were actually undertaking the purported challenge : <PARA> that article referenced france ’ s the local , whose original article ( also published on 29 april 2015 ) was far plainer in describing what was in all likelihood a classic urban legend of the crime - warning variety . the article admitted that the “ game of 72 could even be more of a hoax than an actual phenomenon ” but went on to say that the “ fact that officials are taking the incident seriously is perhaps unsurprising given france ’ s troubling history when it comes to dangerous social media crazes ”: <PARA> the fact that a 13 - year - old girl in france named emma disappeared for three days at some point in april 2015 has been proffered as the sole piece of evidence documenting that the “ game of 72 ” is a real phenomenon . but there ’ s just one problem — that story involving emma didn ’ t check out , according to police : <PARA> aside from that discredited story , the only evidence such a “ challenge ” had occurred consisted of ping - ponging warnings among french parents on social media sites issued after the fact . no one was even sure if the kids participating were hiding for 12 , 24 , or 72 hours . <PARA> it took about a week for the game of 72 to make its way to north america , but by that point a “ small number ” of “ temporary disappearances in europe ” had stolen french emma ’ s thunder : <PARA> (“ possibly one , maybe not ” is indeed a very small number , and it should be noted that a social media challenge is a far better excuse to one ’ s parents than “ i snuck out and was scared to come home ” or “ i ran away and changed my mind .”) <PARA> at around the same time , scattered police departments began to warn parents about the terrifying new craze : <PARA> on 7 may 2015 , mic published an article that cast doubt on whether the 72 - hour challenge was a genuine teen fad or media invention . and much like the february 2015 rumor of measles parties , it seemed news outlets reached to find “ evidence ” of police concern about the purported trend : <PARA> a lack of any confirmed incidents whatsoever and a corresponding absence of any social media chatter ( aside from people wondering why kids would undertake the 72 - hour challenge ) didn ’ t discourage news outlets from advancing the rumor once again in june 2015 : <PARA> in a thread published by kathy sweeney of southeastern missouri television station kfvs , numerous users speculated that multiple reported disappearances were linked to the game . sweeney claimed a “ facebook page ” was “ encouraging ” kids to participate ( but appeared to be unable to produce a link to it ) and reiterated the unsupported assertion that the “ game ” had first appeared in europe : <PARA> as bbc trending blogger mike wendling observed about the “ game of 72 ”: <PARA> variations : in october 2017 , readers spotted a resurgence of stories about a purported social media challenge , virtually identical to the “ game of 72 ” and dubbed the “ 48 - hour challenge ”: <PARA> notably , the tale developed a new twist as it spread again . although the 2015 scare implied the challenge was an example of teenagers upsetting their parents deliberately , the october 2017 version included a detail about how parental discomfort was measured in social media mentions and rewarded with advancement in the game . the 16 october 2017 belfastlive article reported : <PARA> belfastlive quoted an unnamed parent ( not police ) about a single purported instance of the game being played by teenagers in northern ireland , reiterating the legend in detail but offering no information about how anyone involved learned the teen ’ s disappearance had anything to do with a social media game . the woman said she had “ been told ” that her child was “ in the lead ,” but didn ’ t say or wasn ’ t asked how she came by that information . <PARA> moreover , after claiming that the number of mentions of a “ missing ” player on social media was how kids increased their score in the game , the article indicated the teen in question wasn ’ t actually missing for 48 hours ( thereby violating its primary parameter ): <PARA> sites like the sun covered the purported fad , as did some american news outlets . none of the articles showed any indication teenagers were actually participating in the game : <PARA> most articles referenced an individual parent ( not police ) claiming teenagers were daring one another to “ go missing for 48 hours .” references to the challenge were made primarily by social media users and news sites , and we were again unable to find any examples of teen participation on the platforms via which they purportedly “ dared ” each other to disappear . most october 2017 articles about the “ game ” linked back to the poorly supported belfastlive item , and once again “ warnings ” were disseminated by parents and tabloids — not police .

false	the identity of the whistleblower who spurred the impeachment investigation into u . s . president donald trump has been a source of contention in some political circles . despite the fact that the name of the whistleblower has not been confirmed by lawmakers and is legally confidential , social media users widely shared the identity of a cia officer who they speculated blew the whistle on trump .

mixture	haiti ’ s relationship with the united states and europe can most charitably be described as complicated . haiti ’ s earliest days were characterized by oppression and opposition : the country ( once the french colony of st . domingue ) was born from a successful slave insurgency and declared its independence in 1804 . this beginning characterized an often - antagonistic relationship between countries that profited handsomely from african slavery ( such as the united states ) and haiti . foremost among fears about haiti was that slaves would learn successful uprisings were possible . <PARA> after haiti formally declared its independence , the united states suspended all diplomatic and trade relationships with the country . while the u . s . eventually re - opened trading routes , america didn ’ t recognize haiti diplomatically for nearly sixty years after that . other countries followed the united states ’ example ( and france demanded millions of francs in reparations for its rebellion in exchange for recognizing haiti as a sovereign nation ) plunging haiti into debt and an economic depression that lasted for years , from which the country never fully recovered . <PARA> multiple invasions and economic and political tinkering followed , leaving haiti in a turmoil of political instability and corruption , economic crisis , and a ravaged infrastructure , historically one of the poorest countries in the western hemisphere , despite its fertile land and ability to grow cash crops such as sugar . <PARA> today , child labor and trafficking are endemic in haiti , particularly in the country ’ s manufacturing sector , which is outsourced to foreign companies ( many of them contractors for american companies , such as hanes , dockers , and fruit of the loom ). even when they are not trafficked , laborers in haiti ’ s garment industry earn a pittance by the standards of other countries : the minimum wage was $ 0 . 24 ( usd ) an hour for many years . <PARA> in june 2009 , the haitian parliament unanimously passed a law requiring that the minimum wage be raised to $ 0 . 61 an hour , or $ 5 a day . ( the average cost of living is estimated to be the equivalent of about $ 23 a day .) this pay raise was staunchly opposed by foreign manufacturers who had set up shop in the country , and the united states department of state and the u . s . agency for international development backed those manufacturers . after haiti ’ s government mandated the raise , the united states aggressively ( and successfully ) pushed haiti ’ s president to lower the minimum wage for garment workers to what factory owners were willing to pay : the equivalent of about $ 0 . 31 an hour ( or $ 2 . 50 per eight - hour day ). <PARA> in 2011 , wikileaks released a set of previously - secret diplomatic cables . the american publication the nation partnered with haitian news organization haïti liberté to cover them , finding ( among other things ) how strongly the united states had opposed the minimum wage hike : <PARA> the obama administration ( and the bush administration before it ) had been closely monitoring the situation in the garment manufacturing sector for a long time . in 2006 , congress passed the hope bill ( which stood for the haitian hemispheric opportunity through partnership encouragement ) and provided duty - free entry to garments manufactured in haiti for u . s . companies . that body also passed an updated version of the bill ( hope ii ) in 2008 , which mandated a framework for labor reform in factories . according to cables released by wikileaks , it was exactly these efforts that the united states claimed would be jeopardized by a higher minimum wage . <PARA> so it ’ s true that the state department ( then led by hillary clinton as secretary of state ) strongly opposed a minimum wage increase in haiti in 2009 . however , the state department ’ s efforts did not occur in a political or economic vacuum , and clinton wasn ’ t the sole architect of efforts to quash a minimum wage hike ( as the meme suggests ). it was a concerted effort on the part of haitian elites , factory owners , free trade proponents , u . s . politicians , economists , and american companies that kept the minimum wage so low , and to lay the blame squarely at the feet of any sitting secretary of state would be an incomplete assessment , and thus inaccurate . <PARA> a law establishing a new minimum wage of $ 5 . 11 per workday ($ 0 . 64 an hour ) was finally approved in 2014 , which still fell far short of both the demanded raise by workers ( to the equivalent of $ 11 . 36 per workday , or $ 1 . 42 per hour ) and the recommended daily wage of 1 , 006 haitian gourdes , or usd $ 22 . 86 . <PARA> related rumors of the clintons ’ relationship to haiti appeared in october 2016 , this time alleging that after the haiti ’ s infrastructure was devastated by a major earthquake in 2010 , the state department steered relief contracts to personal friends of the clintons . however , while hillary clinton did recommend specific companies to help with the rebuilding process and e - mails have surfaced indicating that special attention was given to “ fobs ” (“ friends of bill ”), there ’ s no evidence that the united states government awarded contracts to any of those contenders .
false	the claim that undergoing an abortion increases a woman ’ s chances of contracting breast cancer , often cited by anti - abortion activists , arguably has two origins : a scientific one and a political one . its scientific origins have their roots in the 1980s and 1990s , with a series of studies investigating a link between induced abortions and an increased risk of breast cancer . those early studies were ambiguous — no matter what side of the abortion issue one was on , one could ( and still can ) find a study to support their preferred narrative . <PARA> from a scientific standpoint , the issue is no longer ambiguous . after an authoritative 1997 study utilizing government - collected data on every danish women born between 1935 and 1978 concluded there was no increased risk of breast cancer from abortions , organizations such as the world health organization , u . s . national cancer institute , american cancer society , and many others now reject the existence of any such link . the conclusions drawn from that study , as published in the new england journal of medicine ( nejm ), were that : <PARA> from a political standpoint , the issue saw a resurgence in attention under the socially conservative administration of george w . bush , which changed the language on an national cancer institute fact sheet regarding breast cancer and abortions against the wishes of that organization ’ s scientists . this issue was discussed , later , in an august 2003 us congressional report from the committee on oversight and government reform that investigated changes to science policy under the bush administration : <PARA> the notion that reproductive choices affect breast cancer risk is not new , nor is it controversial . it is widely accepted , for example , that carrying a pregnancy to term reduces one ’ s risk of developing breast cancer later in life . this issue is often conflated with the question of abortions increasing a woman ’ s risk , because since carrying a pregnancy to term may reduce risk of breast cancer , having an abortion may offset that reduced risk . that is not the question at hand , however : the question , strictly defined , is ‘ will having an abortion make you more likely to get breast cancer when compared to women who never give birth ?’ <PARA> the scientific basis for the breast cancer - abortion link has its roots , most notably , in a 1980 paper in the american journal of pathology that investigated one potential mechanism proposed for relationships between abortion and breast cancer : that leftover undifferentiated cells in a woman ’ s breast ( which occur as part of hormonal changes that help to prepare a woman for breastfeeding and appear during pregnancy , and which would become fully differentiated by the end of a pregnancy ) are more susceptible to cancer . <PARA> to test this notion , researchers intentionally injected laboratory rats with a carcinogen after interrupted pregnancies , and then compared these results to a series of rats who were never pregnant , and to rats that carried pregnancies to full term , to see if interrupted pregnancies were related to an increased susceptibility to developing cancerous cells . <PARA> the researchers demonstrated that the likelihood of developing cancerous cells was higher in those rats with interrupted pregnancies . the researchers suggested these results were consistent with the idea that the interruption of a pregnancy leaves undifferentiated cells in a woman ’ s breast , and that these cells are more susceptible to cancer : <PARA> since then , a goal of many researchers has been to design studies to see if this mechanism is valid and if it may be relevant in humans as well . for obvious reasons , a carcinogen injection kind of experiment on humans is out of the question , so scientists have to settle for observational studies . the different ways in which one can go about designing such studies have created a cornucopia of results with differing levels of veracity that anyone can point to , in isolation , to support their narrative . <PARA> in terms of research on humans , there are two kinds of observational studies that would be used : case - control studies and cohort studies . in general , case control studies are smaller , and the way in which their control group is identified has the potential to be more subjective or error prone . the national cancer institute defines both as follows : <PARA> dominantly , studies suggesting a link fall into the case - control study design , which are problematic , according to an extensive 2004 review in the lancet : <PARA> an illustration of the quantitative effects such misreporting — sometimes referred to as a “ recall ” bias or reporting bias — could have on final results can be found in a 1996 study whose target population , by design , included both a conservative catholic region and more socially liberal areas . <PARA> though this small , case - control study did show a correlation between abortions and breast cancer risk when comparing populations of women who have never given birth , the study ’ s more significant contribution was demonstrating the effect of recall bias on this kind of study : <PARA> the 1997 nejm study was a cohort study and is generally cited as the authoritative study on the alleged risk of abortion . it avoided reporting bias entirely by not conducting interviews at all , instead relying only on danish data collected by the danish government : <PARA> that doesn ’ t mean you won ’ t find studies or individuals still suggesting a link between abortion and breast cancer . the non - profit breast cancer prevention institute ( bcpi ), founded by joel brind ( one of the main scientists promoting the abortion and breast cancer connection ), an organization whose sole purpose appears to be “ educating ” people about said connection , presents a list of studies that they say support their argument . this list is heavily referenced on anti - abortion websites and can commonly be found shared with the claim that “ 73 studies have examined abortion and breast cancer , 53 show higher risk ” or similar . <PARA> bcpi ’ s is an extremely misleading representation of that information , however . included among those ( presently ) 60 studies showing a “ higher risk ” of breast cancer from induced abortions , 23 were self - described on that organization ’ s list as being not statistically significant . suggesting that a statistically insignificant correlation supports any argument is , in a word , deceptive . <PARA> that leaves 37 studies with statistically significant positive correlations : a ragtag collection of studies as old as 1957 and as recent as 2013 , all of which were case - control or meta - analyses that relied primarily on case - controlled studies , and many of which were designed to test questions other than the abortion - breast cancer connection itself . <PARA> one of the listed studies , discussed above , aimed to demonstrate ( successfully ) that case - control studies are a poor design to analyze a purported connection between abortions and breast cancer . <PARA> two of the listed studies included on the list were not , strictly speaking , studies , as they were conference presentations that received little to no peer review ( i . e . laing et al 1994 , bu et al 1995 ). many of the studies on the list ( e . g ., segi et al 1957 , daling et al 1994 , daling et al 1996 ) cautioned that while they may have demonstrated correlations , their data were not sufficient to establish causation or even to represent actual trends . <PARA> four of the studies on the list reached conclusions explicitly counter to the claim that they demonstrate an increased risk of breast in populations of women who have had abortions : <PARA> arguably the most notable publication on this list , both in scope and in citations , is a 1996 paper authored by brind himself ( who created this list in the first place ), a meta - review of 28 studies ( many of which are also featured individually on the list ). his own study concluded : <PARA> typically , meta - reviews have stated inclusion standards delineating what studies are of high enough quality to be analyzed . in brind ’ s study , however , “ no quality criteria were imposed , but a narrative review of all included studies is presented for the reader ’ s use in assessing the quality of individual studies .” numerous scientists have serious issues with it on this basis . a team of harvard epidemiologists used brind ’ s methods in their own study , concluding that the causation he so confidently claimed the could not be made with the data he used . <PARA> mads melbye , author of the 1997 danish cohort study , took issue with brind ’ s study as well , as covered in a history of the topic : <PARA> our classification of “ false ” acknowledges that some scientists and studies suggest a link between abortion and breast cancer , but that suggestion is rooted in the fact that the methodologies utilized in the studies supporting such a link are widely accepted as flawed by the majority of the scientific community and by the fact that large cohort studies , better suited to test this question in the first place , suggest that no link exists . <PARA> observational studies of any kind will always come with limitations and wiggle room for politically motivated players to exploit , as was the case 2002 . as a whole , however , we regard use of these data to make a causal link between breast cancer and abortions , without any discussion of their significant caveats involved , intentionally misleading enough to be disqualifying .

true	the 2020 iowa caucuses on feb . 3 , 2020 , didn ’ t go quite as smoothly as organizers had hoped . issues with a new app - based reporting system led to delays and confusion about the final results . to make matters worse , organizers had to deal with an influx of prank calls from internet trolls . <PARA> nbc news reported : <PARA> shortly after the caucuses ended on feb . 3 , and just as news started to break that there were problems with the final results , messages started to appear on the internet forum 4chan urging people to call the number for iowa caucuses reporting and clog the lines : <PARA> the exact intent of these calls varied from one person to the next . some of the posts on 4chan stated that they were trying to tie up the lines in order to further delay the results . <PARA> one person wrote : <PARA> others suggested that they should report fake results . one user thought it would be funny to report 1 , 488 votes for andrew yang ( the number 1488 is the combination of two white supremacist symbols : “ 14 ” is short hand for the 14 - word slogan and “ 88 ” stands for “ heil hitler ,” or the eighth letter of the english alphabet ). <PARA> others seemed to be solely interested in causing chaos . for instance , at least two people claimed that they called the hotline and then called the person who answered the phone a racial slur . <PARA> while it ’ s not possible to definitively determine the political affiliations of those involved with this stunt ( users on 4chan are anonymous ), it ’ s clear that most had an anti - democrat agenda . <PARA> mandy mcclure , the communications director for the iowa democratic party , said that the group experienced an “ an unusually high volume ” of calls and that some of the callers appeared to be “ supporters of president trump .” <PARA> bloomberg reported : <PARA> while supporters of u . s . president donald trump may have been involved in this prank , no evidence exists that this act of sabotage was directed by the trump campaign . tim murtaugh , a spokesperson for the trump campain , told bloomberg : <PARA> as both murtaugh and the iowa democratic party noted , these calls weren ’ t the sole problem with the iowa caucuses , and no evidence exists that these calls impacted the final results . rather , it appears the calls were more of a nuisance and may have contributed to a longer delay in the final vote count . <PARA> here are a few other messages we found on 4chan promoting this “ prank .”
false	[ rest of article here .] <PARA> origins : current events and fears often make for the most potent forms of satire , and hot on the heels of a vigorous debate in november 2010 over the forms and effectiveness of security measures employed by transportation security administration ( tsa ) agents at u . s . airports came a few pieces of satire which hit so close to home that they were widely circulated as real news items . one ( covered here in a separate article ) involved a tsa agent allegedly caught pleasuring himself to images of airline travelers displayed on a body scanner , and the other ( referenced above ) described a gay man purportedly arrested for ejaculating while being patted down by a male tsa agent . <PARA> the multiple stereotypical gay references in the latter article ( e . g ., an interior designer named percy cummings being arrested at a san francisco airport ) should give the item away as a bit of humor rather than a real news account . but if additional proof be required , one need only note that this item originated on the dead serious news web site , whose about page notes that “ dead serious news is a satirical website that is updated on an irregular basis . with the exception of the names of public figures , all names are fictional .” <PARA> in a follow - up piece also satirizing current events , dead serious news reported that “ thousands of documents related to the recent arrest ” of the aforementioned percy cummings would be released on the wikileaks web site .
true	origins : an embarrassing attempt at promoting racial diversity came to light in september 2000 , when it was revealed that a photograph used to adorn the front of a university of wisconsin - madison undergraduate application booklet for the 2001 - 02 school year had been altered to add the image of a black student among a sea of white faces . a sharp - eyed reporter with the school ’ s newspaper , the daily cardinal , studied the picture and noticed that the sun seemed to be shining brightly on the face of the one black student in the photo , but not on the faces of any of the students surrounding him . her discovery led to university officials ’ admission that yes , the image used for the undergraduate application booklet cover had been manipulated to better promote an appearance of racial diversity at the school : <PARA> paul barrows , vice chancellor for student affairs , said that admissions officials took [ black student diallo ] shabazz ’ s image from a layout of 1994 welcome week activities and digitally inserted it into the admissions booklet cover in a misguided effort to illustrate the university ’ s diversity . <PARA> “ this was an error in judgment that shouldn ’ t have happened ,” barrows said . he said admissions director rob seltzer , who approved altering the photo , and university publications director al friedman had publicly apologized to shabazz and the community . <PARA> to make things worse for embarrassed university officials , shabazz happens to be a prominent african american student activist who has never attended a uw football game and is deeply involved in efforts to promote campus diversity . <PARA> barrows said that seltzer gave him a draft copy of the admissions packet with student football fans pictured on the cover . he said that when he saw all of the fans were white , he told seltzer : “ you can do better than that , rob . find something more diverse .” <PARA> seltzer said his office spent the summer searching for cover photos that would illustrate greater diversity at uw , where minorities are 10 percent of the 40 , 000 students enrolled . when he could not find one , he approved adding shabazz ’ s photo to the crowd scene and friedman ’ s office created the image for the cover . <PARA> school officials eventually decided to spend about $ 64 , 000 reprinting a new batch of 100 , 000 application booklets , with the updated version featuring a cover photo of the university ’ s memorial union terrace at sunset . <PARA> the brouhaha over the university of wisconsin - madison ’ s manipulation of a photograph was satirized in a 6 december 2000 article (“ black guy photoshopped in ”) by the humor publication the onion : <PARA> “ here at iowa state , we have a remarkably diverse student body , with literally dozens of non - whites ,” iowa state director of student affairs andrea driessen said . “ we thought a picture with at least one non - white happily interacting with whites would be a great way to show off this fact . unfortunately , we didn ’ t have any pictures of whites and non - whites actually interacting , so we had to make one up .” <PARA> said chancellor dr . michael arbus : “ an unaltered , or ‘ real ,’ cover photo would not have adequately captured the glorious rainbow of multiculturalism that is isu . we thought it best to take a more illusory , ‘ less - actual ’ approach in depicting this school ’ s racial demographic .”
false	origins : this photograph of a large snake reportedly pulled from a lake in proctor , north carolina , by an excavation machine was widely spread via social media in june 2013 . like the subjects of many extraordinary internet - circulated animal images , the snake in this photo appears to be a well - traveled one of varying size : this same picture has been posted with text stating that the serpent was found anywhere <PARA> from north carolina to indonesia to the panama canal , and measured anywhere from about 46 to 98 feet ( 14 to 30 meters ) in length . <PARA> this photograph appears to have first hit the internet back in november 2012 , when it was posted to the kaskus indonesian forum , which identified it as a 25 - meter ( 82 - foot ) snake taken from a forest in the indonesian province of riau on the coast of sumatra . about a week earlier , a photograph of a similar snake in a similar pose ( but suspended from a different piece of construction equipment ) had been posted to that same forum and identified as a 30 - meter ( 98 - foot ) snake caught in kalimantan ( i . e ., the island of borneo ): <PARA> an indonesian news article from later in november 2012 described the photo as one taken on 1 november 2012 which showed a python found in a tree trunk by construction workers in the belinyu district of indonesia ’ s bangka belitung islands province , who dispatched the snake with heavy equipment and then buried it . <PARA> estimating the length and weight of this snake from a single photograph is difficult , especially since the perspective of the image ( in which the creature is much closer to the camera lens than the object holding it ) exaggerates its apparent size . we note , however , that the guinness world records entry for “ longest snake ever in captivity ” documents a reticulated python that measured just a bit over 25 feet ( 7 . 7 meters ) in length and weighed about 350 lbs . it ’ s likely the indonesian reptile pictured here is in that ballpark , not a mutant that weighs twice as much and is anywhere from two to four times longer than the largest known snake .

unproven	last night i bought killian a new bag of purina cat chow indoor cat formula in a green bag . i fed him his normal 1 / 4 cup scoop , about 20 minutes later he was vomiting blood , foaming at the mouth and thrashing around the house .. my 15 yr old daughter , who was unfortunately there for the whole ordeal , and i raced out if the house to bring him to the vet , but it didn ’ t end up making any difference because he died in her arms on the way to the vet . <PARA> we came back home and i took a good 5 – 10 minutes with him in my lap on the bathroom floor with my stethoscope to make absolutely positive he was gone and prepared him so that we could bury him the next day . it was only after all this , after i had calmed down a little , i kept saying to myself he was totally fine , i just fed him , he was perfectly fine i just fed him ... that ’ s when it hit me . i started looking online and found numerous recent stories that all read very closely to mine , about the same cat food brand all within the last week .. what the hell is this ?? my cat is friggin dead .. these people need to stand up and take notice because this will not be taken lightly .. <PARA> i was able to pull some blood samples , and obtained some oral swabs . i am also having the bag of cat food analyzed .. if these things point to irresponsibility on purina ’ s part nothing will be able to save them from me . <PARA> origins : on 9 november 2014 , a facebook user posted the above - quoted status update to the social network about purina cat chow and her cat killian ’ s recent death . the woman claimed shortly after consuming the kibble , her pet became ill and subsequently died . <PARA> the complaints referenced by the poster in her status update appear to be from a user - submitted consumer complaints site where other pet owners have shared stories of their animals ’ becoming ill after eating purina cat chow or related products : <PARA> i purchased the large bag of purina cat chow complete . says it is new shape same taste . my cat became very sick and started vomiting after feeding for a couple of days . i gave it to my daughter thinking it was just my cat but her cat became sick and started vomiting also . i am going to throw it away – but i thought someone should be aware of it . <PARA> more than 700 complaints have been lodged on the purina page , <PARA> but the submitted content spans a number of different purina products . it ’ s important to note purina and related brands ( such as friskies ) are consumed by millions of pets across america on a daily basis , and pets who become ill are likely to have consumed that brand ’ s products simply due to their ubiquity in stores and pet food bowls nationwide . <PARA> while the plea from a grieving pet owner has caused concern among cat owners on social media sites , her warning was expressed as a suspicion that was under investigation , not as something that had been definitively proved . on twitter , an official account linked with the purina brand addressed concerns about purina cat chow ’ s safety : <PARA> we assure you there are no product issues with cat chow or any purina product . safety and quality are our top priorities . <PARA> while the purina cat chow warning has spread across sites like facebook , the original poster has not yet issued an update stating whether a cause of death for her cat was ever confirmed . and although a large number of pet owners have ascribed their cats ’ or dogs ’ illnesses to recent consumption of purina products , no illnesses or pet deaths have recently been positively linked to the brand . many of the pet owners reporting cat illnesses surmised purina products were to blame , but no causal connection between purina cat chow and pet illness has been documented despite the brand ’ s widespread consumption by american cats .

they were always provided for free . <PARA> similarly , the red cross was said to be selling to servicemen cigarettes that had been donated by major tobacco companies . <PARA> the red cross blood donor service was also a target of rumor - mongering during wwii . whispers swept along that blood donations had been accepted from the japanese , thereby ( it was said ) making it likely the offspring of those receiving such transfusions would display japanese characteristics . similar concerns were raised about blood from african - americans being added to the pool . rumor was also used to discourage those inclined to donate blood : stories were spread that those who gave ran the risk of contracting infection or disease from unsterilized instruments . <PARA> the affairs of dame rumor , a 1948 book about rumors rampant in america , recorded the following : <PARA> there is truth to one of the rumors , however . during wwii the american red cross did indeed charge american servicemen stationed abroad for coffee , doughnuts , and lodging . however , they did so because the u . s . army asked them to , not because they were determined to make a profit off homesick dogfaces . <PARA> the request was made in a march 1942 letter from secretary of war henry l . stimson to norman h . davis , chairman of the american red cross . because american soldiers were fighting as part of the allied forces , matters had to be considered on a force - wide ( rather than a solely american ) basis . the red cross was asked to establish club facilities for u . s . servicemen overseas where allied troops would be welcome , and because english and australian soldiers were being charged for the use of such facilities , it was deemed unfair that americans were to get similar benefits for free ( especially in light of the fact that their pay was higher than that of their allied counterparts ). for the good of the alliance , the american red cross was persuaded to exact nominal charges from american gis for off - base food and lodging . <PARA> this act resulted in the red cross ’ coming to be regarded by numerous gis as having profited off them . bad feeling exists to this day over the decision to charge american servicemen for these services , with any number of such soldiers and their families carrying long - lasting resentments against the service . yet while that ire might have been merited , it was misdirected : the culprit was the u . s . army , not the red cross . <PARA> general dwight d . eisenhower , chief of staff , united states army , addressed the controversy surrounding this issue in a statement to the press on 10 april 1946 : <PARA> even after world war ii , the red cross continued to be dogged for years by false tales about their imposing fees on military personnel for basic humanitarian services , such as the following 1952 rumor that claimed the organization had charged a u . s . serviceman interest on money he borrowed from them to attend his mother ’ s funeral : <PARA> the advent of social media breathed new life into rumors the red cross was charging disaster victims , which spiked amid separate online controversies involving the organization following hurricanes harvey and irma in august - september 2017 : <PARA> in a separate article regarding rumors that the red cross was charging disaster victims after hurricane harvey hit in august 2017 , we noted : <PARA> on 31 august 2017 , the red cross detailed how they would be spending their funds in the wake of hurricane harvey , introducing that documentation with the following statement :
false	one of the first pieces of fake news to emerge from the mass shooting at a baptist church in sutherland springs , texas was the reinvention of an old hoax revolving around a fictional muslim convert named “ samir al - hajeed .” <PARA> on 6 november 2017 , the day after devin patrick kelly shot and killed 26 people and injured others , the disreputable right - wing web site freedom daily falsely reported that the gunman was , in fact , a muslim convert named “ samir al - hajeed .” <PARA> on the day of the shooting , the local california weekly newspaper did indeed publish an inaccurate and poorly - sourced article which combined some facts with material related to a long - standing hoax . <PARA> the observer ’ s original headline was “ islamic convert is shooter in church shooting in sutherland . he left online manifesto .” <PARA> these two claims appear to be entirely based on one tweet from the account of mustachio / millenial_matt : <PARA> in reality , samir al - hajeed / samir al - hajid / samir al hajib is a fictional white american muslim convert who was also falsely identified by social media users as the assailant in the october 2017 las vegas shooting . <PARA> “ samir al - hajeed ” is an extension of the long - running “ sam hyde ” hoax , in which the comedian sam hyde – a real person – has routinely and mischievously been named as the gunman in a series of high - profile attacks . <PARA> the similarity between the names – sam hyde and samir al - hajeed – is clear and any images of “ samir al - hajeed ” are actually images of sam hyde , as these tweets show . <PARA> the two video clips used in the short video tweeted out by twitter user mustachio , who attributed the sutherland springs attack to “ samir al - hajeed ,” are actually videos of the comedian sam hyde , which you can find here and here . in the first , hyde is discussing his “ plans ” to join the united states marine corps , and in the second he is discussing fellow youtuber pewdiepie . <PARA> predictably , sam hyde has already been falsely named as the sutherland springs gunman . in fact , u . s . representative vicente gonzalez mentioned in an interview with cnn that the name “ sam hyde ” had been given to him as the assailant , demonstrating the pervasiveness of this particular hoax . <PARA> the santa monica observer has changed the headline in its story to reflect the fact that authorities have identified devin patrick kelly as the actual assailant in the church attack . <PARA> however , as of 6 november 2017 , the article itself still contains two images of sam hyde – taken from mustachio ’ s tweet – whom a photo caption falsely identifies as kelly . neither sam hyde nor the fictional “ samir al - hajeed ” have anything whatsoever to do with the sutherland springs attack . <PARA> in a press conference the morning after the shooting , freeman martin of the texas department of public safety told reporters that the shooting was not racially or religiously motivated , but rather that a “ domestic situation ” was at play . while in the military in 2012 , kelly was convicted of domestic violence and was discharged for bad conduct .

false	gentle , plaintive , and compelling , “ fire and rain ” was the hit that launched the career of james taylor , one of the 1970 ’ s premier singer - songwriters . <PARA> the song ’ s mournful lyrics of loss and redemption were enigmatic to many listeners , prompting one of music ’ s most enduring “ what is this song really about ?” urban legends : <PARA> some listeners tried to make sense of the words by reading literal meaning into them , and taylor ’ s audience collectively developed an autobiographical story line for his “ fire and rain ” lyrics : <PARA> in this fan - based interpretation , suzanne , the girl who was now “ gone ,” had been taylor ’ s girlfriend . they were frequently separated as he traveled on tour , but they kept in close touch , spending “ hours of time on the telephone line ” and talking about the good “ things to come ” when taylor finally established himself as a musician . seeing how disconsolate taylor was at being away from his love , his friends arranged for suzanne to fly out to meet him at his next tour stop . suzanne joyfully accepted , but the flight carrying her to a reunion with her beloved crashed , and she was killed . both the “ flying machine ” and taylor ’ s “ sweet dreams ” were now “ in pieces on the ground ,” and he had lost the woman he “ always thought ” he ’ d “ see again .” <PARA> although james taylor ’ s song is indeed autobiographical , it doesn ’ t match the heart - wrenching story line of popular legend . by the time “ fire and rain ” established taylor as an international pop star at the tender age of twenty - two , he ’ d experienced plenty of psychological and physical pain upon which he could draw in crafting his lyrics . he already had a long history of depression and substance abuse for which he ’ d been hospitalized several times ( his first hospital experience was the basis of one of his earliest songs , ‘ knocking ‘ round the zoo ’), and he ’ d spent quite a while recuperating from a near - fatal motorcycle accident which had broken both his hands and feet and prevented him from picking up a guitar for several months . all of this was fodder for his songwriting , as he explained in a 1972 interview with rolling stone : <PARA> the “ suzanne ” mentioned in the lyrics to “ fire and rain ” wasn ’ t taylor ’ s girlfriend or fiancée , but rather an acquaintance ( suzanne schnerr ) whom he had met while he was a teenager in new york in 1966 - 67 , performing with friends danny kortchmar and joel o ’ brien , as part of a group called the flying machine . as quoted in timothy white ’ s biography of him , taylor said that “ i knew suzanne well in new york , and we used to hang out together and we used to get high together ; i think she came from long island . she was a kid , like all of us .” <PARA> a few years later , after taylor had decamped to london and was finishing up his debut album for the beatles ’ apple records label , he found out that suzanne had committed suicide several months earlier , and that his friends had withheld the news from him so as not to let it distract him and derail his career : <PARA> by the time taylor left london for the united states at the end of 1968 , he was battling a heroin addiction for which he was hospitalized in manhattan shortly after his return ; he then committed himself to austen riggs , a private psychiatric facility in stockbridge , massachusetts . it was during his manhattan hospital stay that he formed the song ’ s second verse , with its pleas to jesus to “ look down upon ” him and help him “ make a stand ” against the ravages of drug addiction . <PARA> earlier , during his senior year of high school , taylor had entered mclean hospital in belmont , massachusetts , where he spent several months being treated for depression . after leaving that facility he traveled to new york and hooked up with childhood friend danny kortchmar , where they formed the aforementioned group the flying machine , a venture that ended badly for taylor both professionally and personally : <PARA> the third and fourth verses of “ fire and rain ,” finished off during taylor ’ s months at austen riggs , mustered his feelings about his life in and around his hospital stays , as he struggled with depression , strove against heroin addiction , and experienced the disappointment of a bad ending in his fledgling musical career . thus the allusion in the song ’ s final line about “ sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground ” is not merely an indirect reference to shattered ambitions and ruined lives , but a sly direct reference to a previous professional failure . <PARA> although james taylor ’ s eponymous debut album was not a tremendous commercial success , he sufficiently overcame the personal issues with which he had been grappling to leave apple records , sign with warner bros ., and record an album ( sweet baby james ) that , propelled by the success of its second single , “ fire and rain ,” reached a lofty # 3 position on the billboard charts in 1970 .
mixture	u . s . vice president mike pence is particularly well - known outside of the u . s . for his past pronouncements and policies on lgbt rights , and the presence of the conservative christian former congressman prompted protests in ireland and iceland during his visits to those countries in september 2019 . <PARA> according to one viral tweet , opposition to pence ’ s visit to iceland was such that many local companies in the capital city , reykjavík , conspicuously raised lgbt rainbow flags as a gesture of protest . on sept . 4 , the day of pence ’ s visit to reykjavík , the icelandic - american drag queen heklina posted two photographs of a row of rainbow flags , along with the following message : “ here ’ s a great example of why i ’ m proud to be from iceland . mike pence is visiting the country and everyone is outraged . mayor of reykjavik , all the biggest firms and companies , everyone , they ’ re all flying the gay flag . all pence will see everywhere on his visit is gay gay gay .” <PARA> that widely shared tweet was further promulgated when the left - leaning facebook page occupy democrats shared a screenshot of it the next day : <PARA> we received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of heklina ’ s claims and the authenticity and provenance of the photographs she included in her tweet . <PARA> heklina ’ s description of the flag phenomenon was somewhat exaggerated , perhaps for rhetorical effect . but pence ’ s visit to reykjavík was marked by an unusually widespread initiative to fly the lgbt rainbow flag among businesses , government buildings , and other entities in the city , especially those located close to a building where pence held meetings with local officials . <PARA> the two photographs heklina included in her tweet were authentic . the one on the left was taken by isold uggadottir and shows a row of rainbow flags erected by the it company advania outside its building on guðrúnartún in reykjavík : <PARA> the location was highly significant because the white building visible in the background , across the street from advania , is höfði house , a historic reykjavík landmark and the location where pence met with iceland ’ s president guðni th . jóhannesson on sept . 4 : <PARA> the photograph on the right in heklina ’ s tweet was also authentic and showed the same set of flags outside advania ’ s building . it appears to have been taken from an article published on the website of the icelandic magazine mannlíf . <PARA> a spokesperson for advania confirmed in an email to snopes that the company had erected the rainbow flags around 11 . 30 a . m . on the day of pence ’ s visit , adding , “ we felt it was a good day to celebrate diversity .” however , the spokesperson declined to either refute or confirm the widely held understanding that the flags were flown specifically in response to pence ’ s visit or intended as a gesture of protest against his past pronouncements on lgbt rights . the rainbow flags were not taken down immediately after the vice president ’ s meeting across the street , and as of sept . 6 they were still in place , according to the spokesperson . <PARA> several other local businesses and even some official government buildings , especially in the neighborhood surrounding höfði house , also erected rainbow flags — or allowed them to be erected — during pence ’ s visit . some entities did this on their own initiative , but others were encouraged to do so by tótla sæmundsdóttir , an lgbt activist , and katrín oddsdóttir , a prominent icelandic human - rights lawyer . <PARA> they distributed rainbow flags to several buildings on the day of pence ’ s visit , in an effort to form what sæmundsdóttir described to snopes as a “ rainbow circle ” around the location of pence ’ s meeting with the president of iceland . <PARA> the following is an incomplete list of the entities that flew rainbow flags in reykjavík during pence ’ s visit on sept . 4 : <PARA> vsó ráðgjöf , an engineering firm located across the street from höfði house . <PARA> íslenska hamborgarafabrikkan , a hamburger restaurant located across the street from höfði house . <PARA> reykjavík service center ( 12 - 14 borgartún ), an official municipal building located down the street from höfði house . <PARA> efling , a trade union located about five minutes ’ walk from höfði house . <PARA> 7 borgartún , headquarters of rikiskaup , the icelandic government ’ s office of central public procurement , located one block away from höfði house ( photograph courtesy of katrín oddsdóttir ): <PARA> laugarneskirkja , a lutheran church located about a mile east of höfði house . on facebook , the church wrote “ love is love ”: <PARA> bsrb , a public sector employees union , located around half a mile south west of höfði house . <PARA> ráðhús reykjavíkur ( reykjavík city hall ), located around one mile west of höfði house . <PARA> according to sæmundsdóttir , the following entities also erected rainbow flags to mark pence ’ s visit , though we haven ’ t yet found photographic evidence to corroborate these particular claims : handprjónasambandið ( a craft store and handknitting association ), and kaffitár ( a café ). <PARA> the participation of city hall could be what heklina was alluding to when she claimed that the mayor of reykjavík had flown the rainbow flag . mayor dagur b . eggertsson himself later retweeted heklina ’ s claims , but a spokesperson for city hall told snopes in an email that eggertsson did not personally order the flags to be flown , though the spokesperson added “ i am sure he had nothing against it .” rather , the decision to erect lgbt rainbow flags outside city hall was taken by “ officials and city staff ,” the spokesperson told us . <PARA> we didn ’ t find evidence that “ all the biggest firms and companies , everyone ” in iceland had flown rainbow flags to protest pence ’ s visit there in september 2019 , as heklina wrote in her tweet . that appears to have been an exaggeration , perhaps for rhetorical effect . however , we did find evidence of a remarkable initiative among several entities in reykjavík — including city hall , businesses , municipal and government buildings , and a church — to mark pence ’ s visit in that way . <PARA> given that this effort was particularly concentrated around höfði house , where pence held meetings on sept . 4 , it is reasonable to imagine that the visual effect of the flags would have been quite striking to the vice president as he entered and exited that neighborhood . <PARA> the fact that reykjavík city hall , a second official municipal building and an icelandic government agency all joined in forming the “ rainbow circle ” is especially noteworthy .

true	sometimes you ’ ll receive a story in e - mail that is so outlandish you ’ ll immediately want to dismiss it as a hoax . and sometimes those outlandish stories are the very ones that turn out to be true : <PARA> on 25 november 2000 , in portland , oregon , a chocolate - colored labrador named ivy was killed by an exploding tennis ball . she was being walked that morning by a friend of her owner while her owner was away on a fishing trip . the man came upon a tennis ball wrapped in tape lying in the median strip out front of the dog ’ s home . after kicking at the ball a bit himself , he picked it up , thinking it would make a good toy for ivy . he carried it with him for about an hour , tossing to ivy at times so she could fetch it back to him . on one trip , she must have chomped down on her prize harder than usual and thereby triggered the fatal blast . although her walker was standing less than 7 feet away from her at the time , and the explosion was of sufficient force that folks living four blocks away felt it , the man was apparently uninjured . <PARA> the badly injured dog did not die from its injuries but could not be saved , said jorge roman , a multnomah county animal control officer on the scene . bystanders begged police to shoot the dying animal to stop her suffering before a veterinarian was called to euthanize her . <PARA> bomb fragments were removed from the deceased dog to determine what kind of explosive device she ’ d encountered . <PARA> police bomb experts say explosive devices in tennis balls have become more common in the city . “ you ’ d be surprised how many calls we get ” about this type of explosive , said henry groepper , spokesman for the portland police bureau . <PARA> in that year roughly six tennis ball bombs had been reported to the portland area ’ s bomb disposal unit , but they caused no other injuries . <PARA> tennis ball - bombs are nothing new . investigators said they are usually made by curious teens and young adults “ looking for that big bang ,” using information found on the internet . they are then abandoned when they don ’ t detonate like they were supposed to . <PARA> because this sort of bomb isn ’ t all that uncommon , folks are cautioned to leave found tennis balls alone , especially those which are wrapped in duct or electrical tape or feel heavier than usual .

false	origins : those of us who set forth on our first trick - or - treating expeditions four or five decades ago don ’ t need to see any statistics to know that the halloween - related retail business has grown tremendously during that period . way back when , many retailers didn ’ t carry much more in the way of halloween supplies than some <PARA> candy , boxes of costumes , and a few cardboard bats and skeletons for decorating windows and doors , and that sort of merchandise generally didn ’ t appear on store shelves until at least the latter part of september . now , however , halloween generates an estimated $ 5 billion a year in retail sales in the u . s ., with some stores stocking aisles of halloween - related merchandise as early as july . <PARA> the national retail federation ( nrf ) estimates that nearly two - thirds of americans now celebrate halloween in a manner that involves retail purchases , spending an average of $ 60 each — a third of that amount going towards the purchase of all - important candy . <PARA> any discussion of booming seasonal retail sales inevitably prompts comparisons to the preeminent binge time for consumer spending , the mall - stuffing christmas holiday season , leading to the legend that halloween has now worked its way up to the # 2 spot on the holiday sales charts , just behind christmas . however , according to the nrf , halloween ’ s $ 5 billion in retail sales place it no higher than sixth among holiday sales leaders , behind the following : <PARA> it ’ s easy to see why people might get the impression that halloween sales have crept up just behind those of christmas , as those occasions are the centers of our two longest , most “ visible ” holiday seasons : halloween engenders home displays that rival or surpass those of the winter holidays in elaborateness ( if not yet in ubiquity ), and halloween is the only celebration that prompts widespread public wearing of distinctive , highly noticeable apparel . <PARA> however , one quality of most higher sales - spurring holidays that halloween so far lacks is the custom of celebrants ’ giving pricey gifts to others — unless halloween evolves into an occasion for giving on a scale considerably greater than handing out a bit of candy to bands of trick - or - treaters , it may not surpass occasions such as mother ’ s day and valentine ’ s day and approach the # 2 slot in retail sales anytime soon .
false	in march 2016 , a message circulated warning users not to “ accept ” a viral video entitled “ sonia disowns rahul ” because it contained a malicious virus : <PARA> the multiple versions of this warning circulated in march 2016 mostly had two things in common : they claimed that the warning originated “ on the radio ,” and they urged recipients to forward the message to their entire contact list . <PARA> we found no record , however , of any radio station earnestly warning people about the purported “ sonia disowns rahul ” cell phone virus , nor have there been news articles about the dangers of the video or warnings issued by antivirus companies . in fact , the only mentions we could find about “ sonia disowns rahul ” virus were the circulated warnings themselves . <PARA> the “ sonia disowns rahul ” virus hoax bore a striking resemblance to the “ dance of the pope ” hoax that surfaced in october 2015 . both of these hoaxes claimed that the warning had originated “ on the radio ,” and urged people to forward the message to everyone on their contact list . in both instances , we concluded that there was no evidence that the virus ever existed , and that the circulated message was nothing more than a hoax .
false	in the days following hurricane harvey ’ s devastating impact on the city of houston and southeastern texas in august 2017 , many facebook and twitter users shared what appeared to be a curious pattern : <PARA> it ’ s not clear what exactly these dates refer to , but they appear to be presented as the dates each hurricane made landfall in the united states . the big wobble web site specifically made this claim in a 31 august 2017 article with the headline : “ signs and wonders ! katrina , gustav , isaac and harvey all made landfall on the 29th of august .” <PARA> a 29 august 2017 facebook post by nola mckinley containing the meme was shared almost 400 , 000 times within two days . <PARA> the meme does not accurately state the date of first united states landfall for three of the four hurricanes it mentions . depending on which time zone you use , the fourth date is also inaccurate . <PARA> there are a number of other issues with the viral spread of this meme , including : a u . s .- centric focus on the damage done by hurricanes in the united states , while ignoring the devastation they often first cause in the caribbean ; and a spurious search for numerical patterns in the midst of tragedy . <PARA> the dates <PARA> here are the key dates leading up to landfall for each of the four hurricanes listed in the meme . all dates refer to events timed according to utc ( coordinated universal time ), which is four hours ahead of eastern time , five ahead of central time , seven ahead of pacific time : <PARA> katrina , 2005 ( source : national hurricane center ) <PARA> gustav , 2008 ( source : national hurricane center ) <PARA> isaac , 2012 ( source : national hurricane center ) <PARA> harvey , 2017 <PARA> so if we ’ re looking at the first united states landfall of these four hurricanes , here ’ s how the meme should look : <PARA> if we follow coordinated universal time ( utc ), only one of these four hurricanes made its first united states landfall on 29 august ( isaac in 2012 ). <PARA> however , if we follow eastern time , isaac ’ s landfall happened on 28 august , and harvey ’ s first landfall happened on 25 august . either way , none of these four hurricanes shared a united states landfall date with any of the others , undermining the premise of the viral meme . <PARA> hurricanes are not one - off events that take place on a single date . they are phenomena that evolve , develop , strengthen and weaken , moving over and making landfall at various geographic locations over the course of days and weeks . that makes it easy to cherry pick dates to form a “ pattern .” <PARA> the search for patterns <PARA> it ’ s not clear whether those posting and sharing the “ 8 / 29 ” meme are simply pointing out a curious coincidence ( even though , as we ’ ve shown , the dates are wrong ), or suggesting that there is some conspiracy ( supernatural or man - made ) behind them . <PARA> let ’ s imagine all these hurricanes did make their first united states landfall on 29 august . what would that mean ? <PARA> firstly , it would not necessarily be particularly strange . late august and early september is peak hurricane season in the atlantic . while all four highlighted hurricanes did not make their first u . s . landfall on the same date , they did each occur within the same eight - day period , between 25 august and 1 september . <PARA> secondly , it would not be an example of government geoengineering or climate engineering . conspiracy theorists have already claimed that hurricane harvey is “ the latest example of covert weather warfare being waged on completely unsuspecting populations ... orchestrated and manipulated by an ever more desperate and aggressive global power structure .” <PARA> and some have claimed that the “ 8 / 29 ” date pattern in the meme is a clear sign of sinister government orchestration . setting aside the fact that the dates are wrong , it is unclear why the u . s . government would choose to schedule the united states landfall of four hurricanes for the same calendar date across 12 years , or how this would even be possible . if the supposed purpose of climate engineering is to wage “ weather warfare ” against “ unsuspecting populations ,” why would the purported conspirators continuously choose the same date ? <PARA> conclusion <PARA> there is a pattern behind the dates of these four hurricanes – they all made their first united states landfall within an eight - day period , in different years . but this has a very simple and boring explanation : 25 august - 1 september is part of peak hurricane season in the atlantic . <PARA> any interpretation of hurricane dates that goes beyond this is entirely spurious , requiring as it does ludicrous government conspiracy theories or supernatural predetermination . however , the desire to find numerical patterns and explanations in the midst of terrible human tragedy , such as that brought by hurricane harvey , is a very understandable one . <PARA> we saw similar spurious memes about the dates of terrorist attacks in the aftermath of the 22nd may 2017 suicide bombing at an arena in manchester , england . faced with the horror of dozens of children being slaughtered at a pop concert , many found comfort or distraction in pointing out a supposed pattern of terrorist attacks on the 22nd day of various months . in reality , a terrorist attack is no more likely to happen on the 22nd than any other day of the month .
unproven	in late december 2017 , posts appeared on social media reporting that a man had fallen into a three - day coma after discovering that his wife owned the house they had been renting together for 10 years . most included an image purporting to be a screen capture of a story on cnn headlined , “ man wakes up from 3day comma [ sic ].” <PARA> one of the earliest instances we found on twitter was dated 31 december 2017 and included text written in swahili : <PARA> someone loosely translated part of the text into english , and the resulting meme has been circulating ever since , appearing in tweets as recently as june 2019 : <PARA> these posts were widely shared and discussed thanks to their comedic value ( people never seem to tire of “ battle of the sexes ” tales ), but some commenters questioned the story ’ s veracity , and we received requests from readers to authenticate it . <PARA> starting with the most prominent feature of the meme , the cnn image is clearly fake . it ’ s beyond improbable that a major news outlet would run such a story “ live ” and label it “ breaking news ,” as was done in the image . it ’ s equally improbable that they would run a segment with such an obvious chyron error : the misspelling of “ coma ” as “ comma .” we found no evidence that cnn or any other legitimate news organization ever covered this story . <PARA> we did find , interestingly enough , that it was covered ( in a sense ) on a south african junk news website , abcnews . co . za , in 2018 ( roughly nine months after it first took off on social media ). but although it was illustrated with the fake cnn graphic , the article repeated a similar - but - different tale ( no coma here ) that had been making the social media rounds since mid - 2016 , with at least one variant dating back to 2011 : <PARA> we weren ’ t surprised , once we traced the photograph of the gentlemen in the hospital bed to its origin , to find that it has nothing to do with a man recovering from a coma . the subject is actually cecil williams , a blind new yorker who narrowly escaped death after falling off a subway platform in 2013 thanks to his service dog , who alerted bystanders to his plight . williams ’ injuries weren ’ t serious , nor was he at any point in a coma . <PARA> we also discovered via a reverse - image search that this wasn ’ t the only time williams ’ photo was re - used under false pretenses . for example , it was co - opted for another junk news story about a man recovering from a coma in 2015 . world news daily report ( wndr ), a humor website that describes its content as “ satirical ” and “ fictional ,” published an article reporting that a man woke up from a six - day coma speaking only ancient hebrew : <PARA> as we noted above , anecdotal reports of a man finding out that his wife owns the house they ’ ve been renting were making the rounds in africa years before a variant emerged claiming that the discovery caused the man to collapse into a coma . a possible point of origin for that variant was this late - december 2017 post by twitter user <USER> <PARA> the tweet received a lot of attention , garnering thousands of likes and re - tweets , and may well have inspired the creation of the cnn meme . we contacted <USER> and asked him a few questions via direct message in hopes of establishing whether the story had any basis in fact . unfortunately , we know little more now than we did before we conversed with him . <PARA> he did insist that the tweet was true . “ yes , he later discovered the house he ’ s been paying rent for is owned by his legally married wife ,” he wrote . “ the wife and my uncle [ have ] parted ways and he ’ s doing well now .” <PARA> he also answered affirmatively when we asked whether his uncle was entirely unconscious for three full days , but when we asked if a doctor had actually diagnosed him as comatose , <USER> said he didn ’ t know . <PARA> he then asked us if he would be rewarded for the information he was providing , and when we said no he cut off the interview ( such as it was ). <PARA> the most important thing we learned is that he didn ’ t know if his uncle was clinically diagnosed with a coma . taking the story at face value , it appears that his uncle may have suffered extreme emotional distress upon learning he had been paying rent to his own wife for years and was bedridden for three days in a condition his relatives described as a “ coma .” perhaps something like this happened , but he wasn ’ t literally comatose . emotional trauma isn ’ t normally listed among the causes of a coma , which is defined as a state of prolonged unconsciousness that can result from a brain injury , seizures , diabetes , a drug overdose , or other physical cause . <PARA> we did find mentions in the medical literature of a psychological condition known as “ psychogenic coma ” ( or “ psychogenic unresponsiveness ”) — described as a dissociative disorder with coma - like symptoms . but although case studies suggest that severe emotional trauma may be a contributing factor in such a condition , we came across no examples of a subject falling into a prolonged state of unconsciousness due to an instance of spousal deceit . <PARA> in sum , we find the story improbable and redolent of an urban legend that was going around years before it became a meme , but insufficient evidence exists to definitively rule it true or false .
true	a 27 - year - old idaho woman ’ s run - in with a sociology professor who did not know that australia was a country became fodder for media coverage in february 2018 . <PARA> ashley arnold ’ s trouble with her professor for an online course at southern new hampshire university ( snhu ) first came to light when she asked the school for help in a 2 february 2018 twitter post , saying : <PARA> arnold later told news outlets that she ran afoul of the instructor — whom she did not identify in order to avoid subjecting her to backlash — when she handed in a project for the final course she needed to complete her sociology degree . <PARA> the university would not comment on arnold ’ s grades , citing privacy regulations . but arnold says that when she received a failing grade on the assignment ( comparing social media use between the u . s . and another country ) the instructor explained : <PARA> the instructor reportedly agreed to do “ independent research ” on the matter after arnold referred her to a section of the australian government ’ s web site called “ about australia ” that said “ australia is an island continent and the world ’ s sixth largest country ( 7 , 682 , 300 sq km ).” <PARA> the instructor later replaced arnold ’ s failing grade with a b +. however , the professor reportedly warned her to “ make sure the date , the facts , and the information you provide in your report is about australia the country and not australia the continent .” <PARA> a spokesperson for the university told us : <PARA> we also contacted arnold seeking comment , but we had not heard back by press time .
mixture	if you need help , call the national suicide prevention lifeline : 1 - 800 - 273 - 8255 . or contact crisis text line by texting home to 741741 . <PARA> the death of former new england patriots tight end aaron hernandez , who was found hanged in his prison cell on 19 april 2017 , was followed by rumors and questions that including speculation he intended his suicide to benefit his young daughter : <PARA> this speculation was followed from news reports suggesting that because hernandez was appealing his conviction for the murder of odin lloyd at the time he died , under massachusetts law that conviction could be vacated as if it had never happened : <PARA> the legal concept of abatement ab initio is both seldom invoked and not without controversy due to its potential effect on victims ’ families : <PARA> speculative online posts have stated with certainty that hernandez ’ s death triggered a windfall for his surviving relatives , presuming the nfl star would once again be entitled to a considerable fortune from his football career , but legal analysts and extant case law paint a muddier picture . they say an argument could be made disputing the severance of a contract based upon an arrest for an overturned or vacated conviction , but not that such a lawsuit would necessarily be successful : <PARA> however , the boston globe disputed that achieving such an outcome was feasible : <PARA> in june 2013 , nfl . com reported that hernandez ’ s contract guarantees had been revoked , a decision the nfl based on his arrest and his conduct subsequent to that arrest , not his later conviction . in other words , had hernandez not been convicted in the murder of odin lloyd , that circumstance would have had no bearing on the nfl ’ s june 2013 decision : <PARA> speculation holds that if hernandez ’ s conviction were vacated it would posthumously restore his standing with the nfl , thereby entitling his next of kin to the wealth he would have accumulated if he had never been convicted . but that speculation presumes that since the legal doctrine triggered by hernandez ’ s suicide could vacate his conviction , the nfl would somehow be bound by that outcome to pay out the contract ’ s promises to his family . however , the nfl is a business entity and not a court of law , and hernandez ’ s contract was voided 90 minutes after his arrest based on “ conduct unbecoming ,” not on his conviction . <PARA> abatement ab initio may possibly clear hernandez ’ s name in a technical sense , but legal experts say only that a “ creative lawyer ” could initiate litigation based on that concept , not that the outcome of such litigation is automatic or certain . the legal concept of abatement ab initio is controversial when invoked in high - profile cases like this one because it often serves to protect the existing assets of an appellant ’ s estate , and no provision of the law mandates that the nfl must reinstate hernandez ’ s contract terms on the basis of his death . <PARA> update : henandez ’ conviction was erased by a massachusetts judge in may 2017 . it was later reinstated in march 2019 with the associated press reporting : <PARA> “ the supreme judicial court unanimously found that the legal rule that erased hernandez ’ s conviction is ‘ outdated and no longer consonant with the circumstances of contemporary life .’ it ordered that hernandez ’ s conviction be restored and that the practice be abolished for future cases . the ruling does not affect past cases .”
unproven	on 22 march 2017 , liberal blogs such as the palmer report and addicting info posted stories that said house intelligence committee chair devin nunes had business ties to russia , because a winery he is invested in sold wine bottles in russia through a russian beverage distributor : <PARA> the palmer report post quoted above contained a link to a table published by the los angeles times listing nunes ’ financial wealth . ( the times provided information for all california members of congress , not just nunes , who was listed by the publication as 37th in wealth out of 55 legislators .) nunes reported having $ 50 , 001 invested in alpha omega winery , a family - owned napa valley - based business . <PARA> according to alpha omega spokeswoman kelly carter , the winery ’ s founder robin bagget invited nunes and a few other personal friends to invest in his winery in 2005 . it opened for business in 2006 . carter sent us a company statement by e - mail : <PARA> the russian alcohol broker luding was listed on the winery ’ s web site as a distributor , but was removed . screen shots of the page were posted to social media along with the claim that it proved russian ties between the winery and russian president vladimir putin : <PARA> there is no evidence that alpha omega winery has any substantive business relationship with russian wine brokers . according to carter , the company ’ s primary business is in the united states : 90 percent of sales are direct - to - customer , and only 10 percent of sales are through distributors . most of the distribution occurs in the united states , with some sales in various countries , such as canada , japan , china , switzerland and thailand . <PARA> carter confirmed that luding was the broker that sells alpha omega ’ s wine to russian customers , but added the information was removed from the california winery ’ s web site because it was out of date . luding still lists alpha omega on its web site as a supplier , along with six other u . s . wineries . purchasers can select one of three offerings from alpha omega ( which were , as the company stated , from vintages prior to 2013 : a 2009 cabernet sauvignon , a 2010 proprietary red or a 2012 chardonnay ). luding also lists wine makers from 31 other countries among its suppliers including france , spain , italy , south africa and new zealand . <PARA> scott dworkin , a community organizer for democratic coalition against trump , tweeted to his 111 , 000 followers that that luding was “ close ” to russian president vladimir putin , with the only proof being that they had offered putin a birthday greeting and gift basket in 2007 . <PARA> we have not received a response from nunes ’ spokesman , jack langer . however , we don ’ t find the fact that alpha omega winery sold wine to a distributor in russia proves that nunes has any improper business interests in russia relating to his wine investment . if the company ’ s statement is true that the wine was sold to luding for distribution in russia in 2013 , that would place the transaction well before the russian government was accused of meddling in the 2016 presidential election . there also doesn ’ t seem to be anything suspicious at face value about california wine being sold in russia – luding sells wine from all over the world to its customers .

mixture	a florida retiree wearing a t - shirt that read “ retired police officer ” across the front was temporarily prevented from entering the universal studios theme park in orlando , florida , sparking internet outrage . <PARA> readers saw a viral headline from the right - leaning , police - oriented blog blue lives matter , which read , “ universal studios stops retired cop , says ‘ police ’ shirt is not allowed in park ,” and asked snopes to verify the claim . <PARA> yes , the man , vince champion of ormond beach , florida , was stopped at the gate by park employees , because universal orlando resort has a policy that guests are not allowed to wear clothing that could be mistaken for those belonging to active emergency personnel . perhaps missing in some of the internet outrage , though , was the fact champion was eventually allowed inside . <PARA> champion told local news station wesh that he and his girlfriend went to the resort on nov . 1 , 2019 , to enjoy the park ’ s new “ halloween horror nights ” exhibit , but that he was stopped at the entrance by security guards , who told him he couldn ’ t go in wearing anything that said “ police officer ” on it . in addition to the words on the shirt ’ s front , the back of champion ’ s shirt had a picture of a skull over an american flag with a blue stripe through the middle and the words , “ my time in uniform is over but my watch never ends .” <PARA> park policy states that guests aren ’ t allowed inside while wearing anything “ that represents someone as emergency personnel ,” although champion countered that he didn ’ t believe his t - shirt could be mistaken for an on - duty uniform . he also told wesh that even if it was mistaken , he is still a reserve officer and could help in the event of an emergency . staff let him in . <PARA> we contacted a spokesperson for the park , who confirmed champion ’ s own statement that he was briefly stopped but eventually admitted into the park wearing the shirt . <PARA> although the park issued a statement that said the policy was intended to avoid confusion , champion told wesh that he believed he was “ profiled as law enforcement , properly so , and that ’ s why you didn ’ t want me in there .” <PARA> a statement from a park spokesperson to wesh said the intent of the policy is not to pick on guests with law - enforcement backgrounds : “ we want our guests and team members to be able to easily identify active , working , law enforcement . we do not permit guests to wear clothing or items that could cause confusion .”
false	on 3 june 2016 , the web site awm published an item reporting that spy cameras were being concealed in hotel rooms : <PARA> although the item claimed “ many ” hotel hooks harbored these cameras , it went on to cite a 31 may 2016 facebook post published by the monroe county sheriff ’ s office in key west : <PARA> according to that warning , police in key west located three cameras in womens ’ restrooms in separate locations in may 2016 , but while they were hidden in coat hooks , none of the cameras were located in private hotel rooms ( or even in hotels at all ): <PARA> although it was certainly possible such hooks could be mounted in hotel rooms by predators , the occurrence didn ’ t appear to be a regular one . we found a tiny number of hotel - related camera reports since surveillance equipment of that nature was available . a 2015 incident in england made headlines due to the its rarity : <PARA> in that case , the camera was concealed behind a vent , not embedded within a fixture of the room . the cheap plastic hooks housing cameras in the viral warning were unlikely to go unnoticed for long in hotel rooms , where unusual unauthorized fixtures would likely be immediately apparent to maintenance . <PARA> it is true that police in key west issued a warning about spy cameras in public bathrooms in may 2016 , but the warning had nothing to do with hotel rooms .
false	in june 2018 , the disreputable neon nettle web site claimed that a new study had come to some interesting conclusions about america ’ s political class : <PARA> the neon nettle article ’ s central claim is false , and was arrived at using flawed logic and downright misrepresentation of the study ’ s actual findings . in fact , the article itself contains disclaimers about the significance of washington , d . c .’ s top spot in the rankings , suggesting that the headline is no more than inaccurate and sensationalist clickbait : <PARA> contrast that measure of sobriety further down in the article with the headline neon nettle decided on : “ 99 . 9 % of us politicians are actual psychopaths , new study reveals .” <PARA> in his may 2018 paper ( which has not yet been peer - reviewed ), ryan murphy — an economist and research assistant professor at southern methodist university — arrived at an estimate for the prevalence of personality traits consistent with psychopathy in 48 states and washington , d . c . murphy used existing 2013 research which employed online personality tests to measure the prevalence of the “ big five ” personality traits : extroversion , agreeableness , conscientiousness , neuroticism , and openness to experience . ( interestingly , one of the online tests used in the 2013 research was mypersonality , a facebook app which in 2018 was revealed to have been involved in the leaking of three million users ’ personal data .) <PARA> using these extrapolated estimates , murphy came up with a ranking of 48 states and d . c . for the prevalence of traits consistent with psychopathy . washington , d . c . had the highest prevalence , followed by connecticut , california , new jersey , wyoming and new york . the states with the lowest prevalence of psychopathy , according to murphy , were west virginia , vermont , tennessee , north carolina , and new mexico . you can see the full list below : <PARA> murphy did not measure or estimate the prevalence of psychopathy among politicians , so neon nettle ’ s claim that the study had “ revealed ” that 99 . 9 percent of politicians are psychopaths is false on its face . furthermore , murphy ’ s research involved proxy measures of the prevalence of psychopathy . that is , he extrapolated estimates of the prevalence of certain personality traits consistent with psychopathy , rather than measuring rates of clinical diagnosis . this further undermines neon nettle ’ s claim that the study had found 99 . 9 percent of politicians are “ actual psychopaths .” <PARA> the paper did mention the fact that existing research has more strongly associated certain occupations with psychopathy than others . research conducted by the university of oxford psychologist kevin dutton found ten professions with an unusually high proportion of psychopaths : chief executive officers , lawyers , television and radio news anchors and analysts , salespersons , surgeons , journalists , police officers , clergy , chefs , civil servants . <PARA> while “ politician ” is not on that list , elected politicians often emerge from some of the professions listed , such as lawyer , ceo , and civil servant . dutton has observed elsewhere : <PARA> and in the paper cited by neon nettle , murphy wrote : “ the presence of psychopaths in [ the ] district of columbia is consistent with the conjecture found in murphy ( 2016 ) that psychopaths are likely to be effective in the political sphere .” <PARA> another 2012 study codified certain subjective assessments of job performance , such as behavior and responses to crisis situations , among 42 united states presidents , then scored each of them according to several tests for personality traits consistent with psychopathy . it found that , on average , the presidents scored higher than the general population according to one of those metrics , which measured fearlessness and dominance . when it came to other personality traits consistent with psychopathy , there was no difference between the presidents and the general public . <PARA> there is a basis in the existing research for concluding that politicians are more likely than the general population to possess and display personality traits consistent with psychopathy , such as ruthlessness , fearlessness , persuasiveness , boldness , and so on . however , the prevalence of psychopathic traits among politicians or those involved in politics is still likely to be very low . according to one widely - cited study , an estimated 1 . 2 percent of the general population possess personality traits consistent with psychopathy . <PARA> among business leaders , that prevalence appears to be higher . one study found 3 . 9 percent of managers displayed psychopathic traits , while another placed that figure at 5 . 76 percent , and estimated that as many as 10 . 43 percent of “ white - collar ” managers were “ dysfunctional ,” meaning “ psychopathic characteristics were clearly present although not to a degree that would allow a reliable medical diagnosis to be made .” <PARA> it ’ s possible that the prevalence of personality traits consistent with psychopathy might be as high in the world of politics , but despite the claims made by this article , any reliable figures are lacking .

mixture	in september 2016 , the magazines boys ’ life and girls ’ life put out their usual issues , with wildly disparate cover images and content listings . pictures of the two covers were shared side by side in an image that went viral as a purported example of the divergent ways in which girls ’ and boys ’ interests are represented in the united states : <PARA> however , the original photograph of the covers — while real — is misleading for a number of reasons , mostly contextual . <PARA> the girls ’ life cover is a sample size of one . while this particular cover appears to encourage teens and tweens to focus on their looks at the expense of everything else ( and to tacitly say that being pretty is the only important thing ) at first glance , a closer look at the magazine ’ s web site quickly shows that previous issues bore covers focusing on stories about body acceptance , getting jobs , and dealing with bullies ( and how not to be one ) tucked amid pieces on fashion and celebrity gossip . <PARA> digging deeper into the web site also unearths articles about other ( and not at all trivial ) topics , with titles such as “ nosy parents ? try this to set boundaries ” ( listen , communicate , compromise ), “ september is childhood cancer awareness month “, and “ 5 books that will help you succeed this school year ”. <PARA> but if that ’ s not the point ( and if you consider the cover the most important part of the magazine ), a look at some of the other covers shows a more balanced approach to the hormonally fraught life of the average ten - to sixteen - year - old girl , with headlines showing articles about how to study better in school , how to handle friendships , how to create things , how to boost self - esteem , and book reviews and recommendations . <PARA> it also is important to consider that boys ’ life magazine is not a general boys ’ interest publication but rather the official trade magazine of the boy scouts of america , whose official oath is : <PARA> to clarify , boys ’ life is a magazine that functions as a way to further the very specific ( and positive ) boy scouts ’ message to boys . it is not a usual newsstand magazine , and despite appearances , it is not affiliated with girls ’ life — which has a similar name , and is a magazine , but is not affiliated with the girl scouts or any other similar organization . girls ’ life states its mission as follows : <PARA> karen bokram is the founding editor and publisher of girls ’ life magazine . she told us that the outcry seems to stem from adults placing their own expectations and pressure on young people . she says that by the time girls are reading her magazine , they ’ re already receiving mixed messages about what they ’ re supposed to be ( and with additional pressure from their peers to fit in ), which is in part what her magazine is trying to help them navigate : <PARA> while there is undoubtedly a conversation to be had about the gender binary , sexism , and the difference in expectations faced by young people based on their sex and outward appearance , this photograph of the two covers side by side does not illustrate those issues as clearly as it might seem to at first glance .
false	the advent of various technologies enabling contact with emergency services ( or easier identification during such an event ) has not quelled interest in core functions of long - standing institutions such as 911 and the emergency alert system ( eas ). <PARA> a side effect of the advancement of gadgets and networks into our daily lives is lingering concern those devices will one day fail us ; even the cellular phone was ( in the not - so - distant past ) eyed with some skepticism by first responders . accordingly , the notion police or paramedics are best summoned via landline due to its long - developed and trustworthy capabilities remains despite the popularity and ubiquitousness of mobile phones . <PARA> landlines are are thought to make it easier to track down a person in need of assistance — and in films or on television , mobiles seem to regularly fail in moments of high tension ( clip contains some profanity ): <PARA> various versions of that rumor have circulated in both the united states and the united kingdom , dating back to at least 2006 . the rumor ’ s functionality exists on at least two levels : one cautioning against inadvertently summoning the police ( leading at best to embarrassment and at worst , actual harm ), and another reassuring people ( inaccurately ) that even if you cannot complete a call for help , the cavalry will eventually arrive all the same . the latter notion is one where belief in the claim presents a risk , suggesting that one need only knock a landline off its receiver to eventually summon first responders . <PARA> we contacted the federal communications commission , which referred us to the national emergency number association ( nena ): <PARA> a nena representative told us he was unfamiliar with the rumor , adding that to the best of his knowledge a “ presented dial tone will time out and the line will become inaccessible to inbound calls .” ( or , to put it another way , a “ busy signal .”) <PARA> until the mid - 2000s , mobile phones were largely considered a secondary form of contact to be used sparingly in the absence of a landline , and fixed - location phones were often inadvertently or ( perhaps more often ) deliberately left “ off the hook ” to disable incoming calls — a not uncommon occurrence , as one new york times writer lamented in 2012 : <PARA> technology has brought along with it alternatives for individuals to summon help without dialing 911 and speaking to an emergency dispatcher , a particularly useful function in dangerous situations where a victim cannot discuss their situation . however , experts in emergency telecommunications have confirmed that simply knocking the phone off the hook was never a failsafe for callers in need of assistance . and while people and pets ( and the occasional tomato ) have on occasion accidentally summoned the police , they did not do so by simply removing a receiver from its hook .
false	photographs purportedly showing a vendor displaying nazi flags and homophobic stickers along with pro - trump merchandise at a recent pennsylvania rally for president trump started making their way around social media in october 2018 : <PARA> these images were often shared with the caption “ found at a trump rally in pennsylvania . they aren ’ t even hiding it anymore . they ’ re proud of their racism and homophobia .” <PARA> these pictures are genuine , but they were not recent in october 2018 , nor were they taken at a rally for president trump that month . the photographs were snapped more than two years earlier ( before the election of donald trump ) at the bloomsburg fair in bloomsburg , pennsylvania , in september 2016 . <PARA> the photograph showing the nazi flag appears to have been taken by pennsylvania resident chloe winters , who originally posted it on social media with a message stating that she was “ shocked and appalled ” that a swastika flag was on display at the fair : <PARA> bloomsburg fair officials removed the offensive flag shortly after these photographs went viral on social media : <PARA> officials also found that the vendor , lawrence betsinger , was selling stickers and other memorabilia inappropriate for the fair . betsinger was asked to leave after it was revealed that he was also a registered sex offender :

mixture	july 2016 saw a week of high - profile shootings involving police the united states : on 5 july 2016 , alton sterling was shot and killed by police officers in baton rouge , louisiana ; the following day , philando castile was shot and killed by police during a traffic stop in minnesota ; and the day after that a sniper shot and killed five police officers during a black lives matter protest in dallas . <PARA> on 8 july 2016 , the streaming music service pandora posted a message on social media expressing a feeling of pain and a gesture of support related to those events : <PARA> although pandora ’ s post stated that their “ hearts ache for all of those who unfairly lost their lives ” and included the hashtag # loveaboveall , their use of the # blacklivesmatter hashtag to represent the victims of police shootings but not an equivalent hashtag to represent the policemen killed in dallas ( such as # bluelivesmatter ) generated controversy along with calls for boycotts of the music service . that reaction then prompted social media calls for people to subscribe to pandora as a gesture of support : <PARA> social media messages expressing anger over pandora ’ s message often asserted that the black lives matter movement is anti - police , or that the movement was responsible for the shooting of police in dallas . black lives matter co - founder alicia garza attempted to dispel these rumors during an appearance on all in with chris hayes : <PARA> ironically , those upset over pandora ’ s message announced that they would be boycotting the streaming music service on facebook , even though facebook openly expressed support for the black lives matter movement by erecting a black lives matter sign outside their headquarters in menlo park , california :
mixture	during the christmas holiday in december 2019 , many people took to social media to complain that u . s . president donald trump ’ s cameo in the movie “ home alone 2 ” had been omitted from its broadcast on the cbc : <PARA> this edited version of “ home alone 2 ” was presented as if it were the result of “ trump derangement syndrome .” president trump ’ s son , don jr ., called the cbc ’ s decision to omit trump ’ s scene “ pathetic .” <PARA> while many of trump ’ s supporters accused the cbc of “ censorship ,” or political bias for editing trump out of “ home alone 2 ,” the network offered a much more benign explanation : the movie was simply edited for time . moreover , the edits made to this movie were done in 2014 , long before trump announced that he was launching his presidential campaign . <PARA> when a movie makes its way from the big screen to the small screen , it frequently has to be re - edited . scenes may be removed if they are not suitable for a television audience , or if the network has to make room for commercials . that ’ s why many television movies are preceded with a disclaimer , stating : “ this film has been modified from its original version . it has been formatted to fit this screen and edited for content .” <PARA> the cbc said in a statement that the version of “ home alone 2 ” that aired over the christmas holiday in 2019 was edited for time . the network added that these edits were done in 2014 : <PARA> cbc spokesperson chuck thompson said : <PARA> thompson said that a total of about eight minutes were cut from the original theatrical release of “ home alone 2 .” trump ’ s scene was one of many that had to be cut or shortened in order to make room for commercials and to fit the cbc ’ s allotted time slot for the movie . <PARA> you can view trump ’ s cameo in “ home alone 2 ” below : <PARA> in short , while it ’ s true that trump ’ s cameo in “ home alone 2 ” did not appear in the version of the movie that aired on the cbc in december 2019 , this doesn ’ t appear to be an example of “ trump derangement syndrome .” rather , when cbc acquired the rights to the film in 2014 ( before trump announced his presidency ), the company edited the film for time .
true	in late 2019 , we received multiple inquiries from readers about the veracity of reports that the new jersey - based , arts - and - crafts retail chain a . c . moore was about to go out of business and had announced it would be closing all its stores . the new york post , cbs news , and cnn were among the many national news outlets to report the development . <PARA> those reports were accurate . on nov . 25 , a . c . moore ’ s parent company published a press release that stated that : <PARA> the first a . c . moore store was opened in moorestown , new jersey , in 1985 and the company grew to occupy more than 134 locations along the east coast by 2011 , when another south jersey arts - and - crafts distributor , sbar ’ s , acquired a . c . moore through its affiliate , nicole crafts . <PARA> according to the nov . 25 press release , a . c . moore again grew to occupy 145 stores and employ more than 5 , 000 people , but a hostile retail environment clearly took its toll on the chain , culminating in the 2019 decision to close the business . <PARA> michael ’ s , the country ’ s leading arts - and - crafts retailer , will take on the leases of around 40 locations previously home to a . c . moore stores , according to the announcement , with details to follow .

true	in 1974 , joe biden gave a notably candid interview to the washingtonian , a d . c - area monthly magazine . excerpts from that profile , which painted the young u . s . senator as conservative democrat , emerged in multiple contexts after became a candidate for the u . s . presidency in 2019 . among the many topics covered in the washingtonian profile was the senator ’ s views on abortion in general and the roe v . wade specifically . speaking of that 1972 u . s . supreme court decision , biden did say that he felt it went too far : “ i don ’ t like the supreme court decision on abortion . i think it went too far . i don ’ t think that a woman has the sole right to say what should happen to her body .” <PARA> that statement was memorialized in meme form in the run - up to the 2020 presidential election : <PARA> as we discussed in an earlier fact check , biden ’ s views on abortion rights have shifted since then . in 2007 , for example , biden was given a 0 % score by the ( pro - life ) national right to life committee and a 75 % score by the naral pro - choice america . “ i accept church rule personally , but not in public life ,” he said in october 2012 . on 25 april 2019 , the anti - abortion life site news website announced biden ’ s candidacy this way : “ pro - abortion joe biden announces entry into 2020 presidential race .” <PARA> because the meme accurately represents public statements made by biden in 1974 , however , we rank the claim that he once said roe v . wade went “ too far ” as true .
false	on 29 november 2017 , united states president donald trump retweeted three videos from jayden fransen , the deputy leader of the far - right anti - islam organization britain first who was found guilty of religiously aggravated harassment in november 2016 . as this group has a penchant for sharing out - of - context , misleading , and false information , it wasn ’ t surprising that at least one of these videos , which purportedly shows violent acts committed by muslims , had a misleading caption : <PARA> although the video is frequently accompanied by the caption “ muslim migrant beats up dutch boy on crutches ,” there is no evidence to support this assertion , which in fact came , like so many other unfortunate assumptions , from its comment section . <PARA> this video was first posted to the web site dumpert . nl , a popular video portal in the netherlands , in may 2017 . although the original posting largely focuses on the act of hitting a person on crutches , and it was not shared with any claims about the attacker ’ s religion , some people on the comment section naturally — and baselessly — assumed that the perpetrator was muslim . as the video was reposted to other web sites , the unfounded claim that the attacker was a muslim migrant followed it . <PARA> shortly after this video was posted to dumpert . nl , dutch police officers were able to locate the attacker and arrest him . a news report from the telegraaf identified him as a 16 - year - old boy from monnickendam . the report made no mention of the boy ’ s religion . <PARA> further , when this months - old video was brought back into the spotlight in november 2017 thanks to a retweet from president trump , dumpert . nl posted a short article that mocked trump for sharing the video : <PARA> geenstijl , the web site that operates dumpert , also stated that the attacker in the video was not a muslim : <PARA> the official twitter account of the public prosecution service of north holland also disputed the claim that the attacker in this video was a muslim migrant . in a message posted on 29 november 2017 , they explained that the video showed a may 2017 quarrel between two minors . the attacker , who was born in the netherlands , was placed in the halt program , an alternative settlement for young first time offenders : <PARA> the netherlands embassy in the united states also took to twitter to tell to president trump that “ facts do matter ” and that the attacker in the video was not a muslim migrant :

unproven	not everything offered on a typical chinese menu is authentically chinese , but a presumption has grown that at least the major items of fare are . in the case of chop suey , this expectation may be misplaced . <PARA> chop suey as served in the u . s . is a bland mixture of overcooked vegetables . ( which right there should tell you this dish probably isn ’ t authentically chinese — the chinese would not dishonor honest vegetables so .) this popular menu item traditionally incorporates celery , onion , and thin noodles in a starchy sauce barely touched by soy sauce . different regions add in other ingredients , with bean sprouts made part of the offering in one area , and sliced water chestnut and bamboo shoots another . whatever is added , the underlying integrity of the dish is never compromised — chop suey must always be bland . <PARA> its origins are as mysterious as the dish itself is guileless . according to a favored bit of lore , chop suey is a mispronounciation of “ chopped sewage ,” an angered chinese cook having mixed together the day ’ s garbage in a bit of broth and presented it to san francisco restaurant patrons who ’ d earned his ire . not knowing any better , those being insulted loved the dish , and much to the amused bewilderment of their tormentors , returned time and again to order it . <PARA> another account credits a resourceful cook who whipped up a dish of leftover meat and vegetables to placate a group of drunken miners . yet another squares the responsibility on the shoulders of immigrant chinese cooks charged with feeding laborers on the pacific railroad in california in the mid - 1800s . when all the food they had to cook for dinner was an array of leftover odds and ends , they cooked it all together and called it chop suey . ( parents everywhere have learned this trick — when all else fails , throw everything that doesn ’ t move too fast into one bowl , mix , heat , and christen it with an exotic name like “ indians on the war path ” or “ football fiesta surprise .” kids will then eat it , no matter what horrible thing it contains .) <PARA> another “ origin ” claims a uniquely - mannered chinese man was invited to the white house for dinner . that night ’ s menu proved unpalatable to him , so he excused himself from the table and whipped up his own dish out of whatever he could find in the white house kitchen . <PARA> some believe chop suey has a new york city origin , and go so far as to claim it was invented in 1896 by chinese ambassador li hung - chang ’ s chef . they say he devised this dish to appeal to both american and oriental taste . others claim the ambassador often suffered acute indigestion after being plied with rich foods at obligatory banquets . his aide recommended a bland diet for the stricken ambassador , and together they concocted chop suey . <PARA> the 1896 date is impossible , seeing the oxford english dictionary ’ s first citation of “ chop suey ” comes from 1888 , with said entry showing the term was even at that earlier date in widespread use : <PARA> possibly the dish came about because early chinese miners and railway workers cooked together whatever vegetables and meats they had . in the dictionary of american food and drink , john mariani says the mandarin words for chopped up odds and ends are “ tsa sui ,” which is close enough to “ chop suey ” to support this theory . so is the oed ’ s postulation of the cantonese “ shap sui ” (“ mixed bits ”) being anglicized into “ chop suey .” indeed , the cantonese origin theory is stronger , in light of most of the first chinese immigrants being from the canton area . <PARA> however , some sources argue for a chinese origin for the dish , such as li shu - fan ’ s 1964 hong kong surgeon which describes chop suey as a local toisanese dish ( toisan being a rural district south of canton ). <PARA> although some sources posit a cantonese dish as the true origin of chop suey , others note that what is called “ chop suey ” in the u . s . is virtually unknown in china and bears little resemblance to its supposed progenitor — so much so that , as grace zia chu , cookbook author and teacher of chinese cooking , wrote in the pleasure of chinese cooking , when she was riding in shanghai after world war ii she spotted a neon sign that read : “ genuine american chop suey served here .”
false	in early september 2019 , a tweet attributed to hillary clinton asking for donations to the clinton family ’ s eponymous charitable foundation circulated as hurricane dorian loomed off the coast of florida . <PARA> the tweet was fake . it did not come from clinton ’ s verified twitter account . it appears to have been created and shared as millions braced for the powerful storm . dorian pummeled the bahamas , hovering over the northern part of the caribbean country for more than three days before moving off and threatening states in the u . s . southeast region . <PARA> the fake tweet plays on long - standing , wide - ranging conspiracy theories about the clinton foundation and the clintons . the foundation ’ s recovery - assistance efforts in haiti after a devastating 2010 earthquake have also been the source of a number of unfounded claims . <PARA> clinton , who served as secretary of state during the obama administration and was president donald trump ’ s democratic rival in 2016 , did not write the above tweet . the only thing clinton tweeted about dorian were safety tips for florida residents as the storm approached .
false	on 27 january 2017 , president trump signed a controversial executive order suspending entry into the u . s . for 90 days of travelers from seven countries “ of concern ”: iraq , syria , iran , sudan , libya , somalia and yemen . a week later , a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order blocking portions of that executive order from being enforced . <PARA> the web site usa television capitalized on that controversy by pumping out a series of nearly identical fake news articles , each holding that president trump had “ signed a visa - free travel policy ” for residents of a given country , ostensibly to “ strengthen trade ” with that country for example , one such article claimed such a policy had been implemented for pakistani nationals : <PARA> but usa television also ran an article that said the very same thing about ghana . and botswana . and belarus . <PARA> in fact , in separate articles usa television claimed president trump had also implemented visa - free travel policies for citizens of ethiopia , haiti , kenya , jamaica , malawi , mauritius , papua new guinea , russia , south africa , sri lanka , tanzania , thailand , uganda , ukraine , zambia , zimbabwe , liberia , macau , and the entire caribbean . <PARA> other fake news sites filled in the gaps , posting articles about the same visa - free travel policy ’ s being extended to travelers everywhere , from gambia to namibia to all of asia . <PARA> if usa television and their ilk were to be believed , virtually anyone from anywhere in the world could now enter the u . s . for up to six months at a time without the need for obtaining a visa first . <PARA> of course , none of this was true , as u . s . embassies around the world noted on social media when these fake news stories gained enough traction that officials started receiving inquiries about them : <PARA> the united states does currently maintain a visa waiver program ( vwp ) that allows foreign nationals entry into the u . s . without the need for first obtaining visas . however , vwp participants must meet a series of requirements , they are only allowed visa - free entry for up to 90 ( not 180 ) days , and they must be citizens of one of 38 countries designated by the program . none of the countries mentioned in the fake usa television articles are among those designated countries , however , and visa requirements for their citizens to enter the u . s . have not changed .
true	origins : senator robert c . byrd of west virginia is a man of many distinctions , both positive and negative . at age 90 , he is ( since the retirement of centenarian senator strom thurmond ) the oldest member of the senate and its senior democrat . he ’ s a former member of the ku klux klan . he ’ s serving his eighth senate term in a congressional career that has already spanned more than four decades . he quotes cicero from memory and can reel off an amazing array of facts on command . some colleagues consider him a throwback to the days of daniel webster and henry clay and admire both his dogged dedication to education and his mastery of oratory . others find him “ weird ,” make jokes about his old - fashioned speech and mannerisms , and grumble over his lengthy , self - important floor <PARA> speeches . <PARA> in recent months senator byrd has controlled the floor of the senate for hours at a time , hammering away at what he sees as the weaknesses and secrecy in president bush ’ s proposal to create a homeland security department and criticizing the president ’ s calls for military action against iraq . in a series of caustic and emotional floor speeches he has accused president bush of seeking war with iraq to distract the country from its domestic problems , maintained that the president is drumming up support for an iraq war to boost his poll ratings , questioned how the u . s . will pay the costs of going to war , and opposed president bush ’ s asking congress for the authority to go to war with iraq as “ an unconstitutional blank check .” <PARA> the text reproduced above is vintage byrd , taken from a fiery floor speech delivered by the senator on 12 february 2003 in which he once again condemned president bush ’ s calls for military action against iraq . although senator byrd is by no means congress ’ only critic of the administration ’ s plans for going to war with iraq , his eloquence in putting forth his opinions and arguments on this issue has captivated many like - minded members of the anti - war movement .
false	false <PARA> mrs . thompson had watched teddy the year before and noticed that he didn ’ t play well with the other children , that his clothes were messy and that he constantly needed a bath . and teddy could be unpleasant . <PARA> it got to the point where mrs . thompson would actually take delight in marking his papers with a broad red pen , making bold x ’ s and then putting a big f at the top of his papers . <PARA> at the school where mrs . thompson taught , she was required to review each child ’ s past records and she put teddy ’ s off until last . <PARA> however , when she reviewed his file , she was in for a surprise . <PARA> teddy ’ s first grade teacher wrote , “ teddy is a bright child with a ready laugh . he does his work neatly and has good manners ... he is a joy to be around .” <PARA> his second grade teacher wrote , “ teddy is an excellent student , well - liked by his classmates , but he is troubled because his mother has a terminal illness and life at home must be a struggle .” <PARA> his third grade teacher wrote , “ his mother ’ s death has been hard on him . he tries to do his best but his father doesn ’ t show much interest and his home life will soon affect him if some steps aren ’ t taken .” <PARA> teddy ’ s fourth grade teacher wrote , “ teddy is withdrawn and doesn ’ t show much interest in school . he doesn ’ t have many friends and sometimes sleeps in class .” <PARA> by now , mrs . thompson realized the problem and she was ashamed of herself . she felt even worse when her students brought her christmas presents , wrapped in beautiful ribbons and bright paper , except for teddy ’ s . <PARA> his present was clumsily wrapped in the heavy , brown paper that he got from a grocery bag . mrs . thompson took pains to open it in the middle of the other presents . some of the children started to laugh when she found a rhinestone bracelet with some of the stones missing and a bottle that was one quarter full of perfume . <PARA> but she stifled the children ’ s laughter when she exclaimed how pretty the bracelet was , putting it on , and dabbing some of the perfume on her wrist . <PARA> after the children left she cried for at least an hour . on that very day , she quit teaching reading , and writing , and arithmetic . instead , she began to teach children . mrs . thompson paid particular attention to teddy . <PARA> as she worked with him , his mind seemed to come alive the more she encouraged him , the faster he responded . by the end of the year , teddy had become one of the smartest children in the class and , despite her lie that she would love all the children the same , teddy became one of her “ teacher ’ s pets .” <PARA> a year later , she found a note under her door , from teddy , telling her that she was still the best teacher he ever had in his whole life . <PARA> six years went by before she got another note from teddy . he then wrote that he had finished high school , third in his class , and she was still the best teacher he ever had in his whole life . <PARA> four years after that , she got another letter , saying that while things had been tough at times , he ’ d stayed in school , had stuck with it , and would soon graduate from college with the highest of honors . he assured mrs . thompson that she was still the best and favorite teacher he ever had in his whole life . <PARA> then four more years passed and yet another letter came . this time he explained that after he got his bachelor ’ s degree , he decided to go a little further . the letter explained that she was still the best and favorite teacher he ever had . but now his name was a little longer . the letter was signed , theodore f . stoddard , m . d . <PARA> the story doesn ’ t end there . you see , there was yet another letter that spring . teddy said he ’ d met this girl and was going to be married . he explained that his father had died a couple of years ago and he was wondering if mrs . thompson might agree to sit in the place at the wedding that was usually reserved for the mother of the groom . <PARA> of course , mrs . thompson did . and guess what ? she wore that bracelet , the one with several rhinestones missing . and she made sure she was wearing the perfume that teddy remembered his mother wearing on their last christmas together . <PARA> they hugged each other , and dr . stoddard whispered in mrs . thompson ’ s ear , “ thank you , mrs . thompson , for believing in me . thank you so much for making me feel important and showing me that i could make a difference .” <PARA> mrs . thompson , with tears in her eyes , whispered back . she said , “ teddy , you have it all wrong . you were the one who taught me that i could make a difference . i didn ’ t know how to teach until i met you .” <PARA> origins : this <PARA> touching tale is one of pure invention : there is no teddy stoddard whose life was so changed by one special teacher who reached out to him , no mrs . thompson of rhinestone bracelet - wearing fame . <PARA> this work of fiction was penned by elizabeth silance ballard in 1974 and printed that year in homelife magazine , a baptist family publication , where it was clearly labeled as fiction and presented as such , not as an account of a real - life personal experience . although ballard based some of the details on elements of her own life , she has expressed disappointment that her fictional work continues to be circulated as a true story : <PARA> reached at her new home in rockingham , n . c ., she was dismayed to hear it ’ s still being passed off as truth . “ i think it ’ s absolutely wrong to do that .” <PARA> “ i ’ ve had people use it in their books , except they made it as if it happened to them . in the ’ 80s i heard robert schuller tell this story on one of his broadcasts . he told it as if it was someone he knew .” <PARA> many of the details , including the homemade wrapping paper and teddy ’ s wedding date , were taken from her own life . she remembers vividly her humiliation at giving a home - grown present to a teacher as a child in north carolina , she said . the broken bracelet and perfume were a tidbit from a teacher friend who had gotten such a gift from a child in the class where she was a long - term substitute . <PARA> “ i ’ ve had people use it in their books , except they made it as if it happened to them . in the ’ 80s i heard robert schuller tell this story on one of his broadcasts . he told it as if it was someone he knew .” <PARA> many of the details , including the homemade wrapping paper and teddy ’ s wedding date , were taken from her own life . she remembers vividly her humiliation at giving a home - grown present to a teacher as a child in north carolina , she said . the broken bracelet and perfume were a tidbit from a teacher friend who had gotten such a gift from a child in the class where she was a long - term substitute . <PARA> schuller ’ s personification of the tale is far from unusual : folks determined to make a point will often claim a closer relationship to a story than actually exists in an effort to get their message taken more seriously . someone charmed by the teddy stoddard story will thus claim to actually know the teacher or the boy , although neither exists . <PARA> elizabeth ungar ( née ballard ) has come to see her story attributed to others . those who do include the author ’ s name along with the <PARA> piece almost always get it wrong , with “ elizabeth silance baynard ” proving to be a popular choice for this form of misattribution . yet the name “ ballard ” is key to how the fictional little boy ( named teddy stallard in the original version ) came by his name , and during his 2001 interview with the author , dennis roddy uncovered the backstory . <PARA> a friend who was filling in as a sunday school teacher received a gift of cheap perfume and a broken rhinestone bracelet from a grubby little boy one christmas , and afterwards she told elizabeth ungar about it . ungar combined this incident with one from her own childhood : her christmas gift of hand - picked pecans to her long - ago elementary school teacher . the box of the pecans had caused the other children to laugh derisively , but the teacher soon quelled them with the announcement she was making fruitcakes and these nuts were exactly what she ’ d been lacking . her teacher ’ s compassionate response coupled with her friend ’ s story formed the basis for the work of fiction we now know as “ three letters from teddy .” teddy ’ s last name came from this origin : the surname of the grandmother who urged young elizabeth to bring pecans to her teacher ( stanley ) was combined with the author ’ s then surname ( ballard ) to form “ stallard .” <PARA> can one special teacher make a lasting difference in the life of a child ? yes , absolutely . our history books are filled with instances of precisely that . but those looking for a real - life example of the importance of teachers will have to look elsewhere than this story . <PARA> barbara “ unsteady teddy ” mikkelson <PARA> sightings : paul harvey read this story during his daily radio broadcast on 4 april 1998 . the teddy stoddard story has also been turned into a glurgerific video . <PARA> variations :
false	false <PARA> origins : in september 2015 , in a q & a session facebook ceo mark zuckerberg somewhat misleadingly implied to social media users worldwide that the long - awaited facebook dislike button would soon be implemented . predictably , facebook scammers seized upon this nugget of partial truth in an attempt to more efficiently spread their ( mal ) wares and make a quick buck . <PARA> not long after inaccurate news stories informed facebook users they ’ d soon be getting access to a dislike button , a number of links resembling the example reproduced above and touting the dislike button as an feature available by invitation only , were circulated on facebook . owing to the then - recent spate of news articles about facebook ’ s reportedly forthcoming dislike button , users were more open to believe the link would indeed activate such a feature in their accounts . <PARA> but users who clicked through to activate the dislike button were greeted with a page that mimicked the style of facebook - based content but was hosted outside that social network ( alongside an initial red flag , what appeared to be a ticking deadline clock and apparent limited time to act upon the offer ). whether the user shared the item or not , a second inducement soon appeared promising a large cash sum ( and coded to prevent easy reproduction ): <PARA> neither the original embedded url nor later clickthroughs led to any content hosted on or published by facebook ( which stands to reason , as the facebook dislike button rumor was widely misrepresented , and so no real dislike button was forthcoming ). each of the links was a version of a typical social media survey / sweepstakes scam , such as those that have used kohl ’ s , costco , home depot , lowe ’ s , kroger , best buy , macy ’ s , olive garden , publix , target , and walmart as bait by which scammers aimed to collect personal information and page likes from social media users ( never delivering on their initial lofty promises once the desired information was collected from the marks ). <PARA> a july 2014 article from the better business bureau described common hallmarks of social media survey scams : <PARA> legitimate facebook features are always released through facebook itself , and rarely require users to leap through hoops in order to enable them ( facebook ’ s celebrate pride rainbow profile photo filter was a good example of an official feature released by the social network ). when and if the feature described by zuckerberg in september 2015 ( not a dislike button ) readies for release , it won ’ t appear in the form of a shady survey . <PARA> originally published : 21 september 2015

true	the revival of the sitcom roseanne in march 2018 sparked big ratings for abc , generally positive reviews , and , of course , controversy . however , the initial episodes did not seem to drive the conversation online quite as much as a years - old series of images that suddenly reappeared featuring the show ’ s eponymous star , actor and comedian roseanne barr , dressed up as hitler and pulling gingerbread cookies out of an oven : <PARA> these photographs are real . however , they are frequently shared without important accompanying context . the series of images were originally part of a 2009 article in a “ germany ” issue of heeb magazine , a satirical jewish publication that ran between 2001 and 2010 . ( an infrequently updated version of the magazine still exists online .) in the article which originally accompanied these photographs , entitled “ that oven feelin ’,” author oliver noble wrote that roseanne asked to dress up as hitler for the spread , as she believes ( or at least jokingly said that she believes ) that she may be the reincarnation of the führer himself : <PARA> the photoshoot stirred up considerable controversy at the time , and from pundits across the political spectrum . segments on the view and the o ’ reilly factor criticized the comedian for the hitler - themed photoshoot . heeb , however , defended the pictures and noted that holocaust jokes are frequently featured in hollywood movies , explaining that as a satirical , jewish publication its goal was to challenge preconceptions : <PARA> roseanne also addressed the issue during an episode of the green room with paul provenza . the conversation about those hitler images begins about the eight minutes in . we ’ ve transcribed the relevant portion below :
mixture	in december 2019 , numerous websites published articles claiming that pope francis had compared u . s . president donald trump to herod the great , the client king of judea who ordered the “ massacre of the innocents ” according to the christian gospel of matthew . <PARA> breitbart reported : <PARA> pope francis made the remark in question while fielding questions at a conference in thailand . he did indeed refer to herod while talking about the treatment of refugees . more specifically , the pope made this reference directly after saying that “ there are walls that even separate children from parents ” in other parts of the world , which many interpreted to be a reference to the trump administration ’ s policies at the u . s .- mexico border of separating parents from children . <PARA> pope francis made this comment after he was asked a question about the “ many refugees in thailand .” the pope ’ s full response can be found below ( emphasis ours ): <PARA> pope francis truly referred to king herod while speaking about the treatment of refugees worldwide . he also mentioned a policy ( border walls and the separation of children from their parents ) that could reasonably be assumed to be a reference to the united states ’ immigration policy . however , pope francis did not mention trump by name . the pope was also asked a question about refugees in thailand ( not the united states ) and referred to herod during a longer answer about how refugees are treated around the world . <PARA> while this quote from the pope is certainly real , he did not explicitly compare trump to king herod . as such , we ’ ve rated this claim as “ mixture .”
unproven	the faintly derogative epithet “ son of a gun ” has been documented as part of the lexicon of the english language since 1708 , but no one can really lay claim to knowing how it began or what the phrase originally signified . numerous interesting backstories have emerged in the centuries since , and it ’ s possible one might even be the right one , but we no longer have any way of knowing . we can , however , dismiss some of the more fanciful “ explanations ” that have come along : <PARA> we can dismiss many of the recurring elements in the four fanciful explanations touted above . first , wives and girlfriends ( i . e ., prostitutes ) were not routinely brought along by ordinary sailors on naval vessels which were often out on a commission for months or years at a time . can you imagine how much extra space would have to be built into these ships , and how many extra rations they ’ d have had to carry , if all crew members brought their wives and girlfriends along ? and where did these women stay ? there was barely enough room below decks to accommodate the regular crew ( even though only half the crew was ever asleep at once ), and women couldn ’ t be out on deck where they ’ d interfere with the operation of the ship . were they just all stuffed into the hold for six months at a time ? <PARA> yes , some officers on some voyages were permitted to bring along wives , but this happened infrequently at best , making the presence of non - passenger females ( pregnant or otherwise ) aboard sailing ships unusual . the vast majority of such voyages had nary a female aboard , thus the notion that a popular phrase sprang from the common occurrence of women ’ s so overrunning vessels that they were routinely whelping on the high seas is seriously flawed . ( larger naval vessels often included a berthing deck which was distinct from the gun deck . this is where the crew on such ships would sleep , not amidst the guns on the gun deck .) <PARA> second , we should look askance at the claim that when in port , and with the crew restricted to the ship , women typically gave birth aboard ship . crews were usually restricted to ship only in hostile ports , which we can fairly assume their home berths were not . and even when shore leave was denied because the captain was intent upon being underway quickly and feared losing some of his crew ( either to desertion or drunkenness ) if they were let off the ship , the wives were under no such restrictions . not being necessary to the running of the ship , nothing would have prevented expectant lasses from returning to their homes to give birth . their husbands not only wouldn ’ t accompany this hypothetical exodus , they wouldn ’ t have wanted to even if they could . in the era of sailing ships , the role of the father during the birth process was not what it is now — dads of modern times may make it their business to be in the delivery room cheering matters on , but papas of more distant ages made certain to be elsewhere , and the farther away the better . bringing babies into the world was considered wholly the province of women ( doctors were summoned only if matters had taken a decidedly bad turn , and even then only rarely ), and men were present at such events only when it could not otherwise be avoided . men certainly did not voluntarily insert themselves into the proceedings , nor would their presence have been welcomed by the women straining to bring children into the world , the midwives attending them , and the array of female relatives that inevitably gathered by the bedside . <PARA> third , although a certain convoluted train of logic might tie the firing of large guns to hastening a difficult birth ( e . g ., inspiration by example , a cornerstone of sympathetic magic ), there ’ s no reason to believe anyone living in those times even tried this , let alone that the practice was so widespread that the firing of guns to ease childbirth begat a distinct phrase . histories of life in the 1700s and 1800s are thunderous in their silence about this practice , and it can safely be assumed that quiet reflects a stunning truth about the matter — that whatever tales we ’ re now telling ourselves , cannonfire wasn ’ t being used to hasten babies into the world . <PARA> granted , gunfire had been employed in distant times to fend off disease ( it never worked ), so there is some historical basis for a tie between the discharge of firearms and medical emergencies . during the 1793 yellow fever epidemic in philadelphia , many took to firing muskets both in the street and indoors under the mistaken assumption that introducing the acrid fumes of burnt gunpowder into the air would kill off the mysterious illness daily making away with hundreds of citizens . such practice was even recommended by the city ’ s government , so this wasn ’ t even a case of a few badly - educated members of the populace seizing upon a fanciful notion ; at the time it appeared to have the backing of the scientific community . however , it was the fumes of the spent gunpowder , not the report of the guns , that was supposed to effect the cure . <PARA> in the realm of superstition , sudden noise is espoused as a way to drive away evil ( we toll wedding bells for this purpose , and the new year ’ s eve hullabaloo springs from that same wellspring of belief ), but there is only one reported tie in that area of study between abrupt racket and the induction of labor , and it involves the ringing of church bells . rather , the canon of superstition advises the loosening and opening of items to assist during a difficult childbirth : windows are to be flung open , doors unlocked , and shoelaces undone to help the impending mother in her travails . nothing in superstition , however , advises frightening women into giving birth , much less introducing roaring cannons into the procedure . <PARA> another explanation for “ son of a gun ” ties the phrase to the reason for shotgun weddings — the child of such unions was deemed a “ son of the gun .” that might seem a more reasonable origin , but that meaning did not appear in connection to the term until 1922 . <PARA> a more believable postulation for the origin of the term shifts the focus onto the occupation of the father and away from the location of the whelping ( which fanciful lore would have us believe was on a deck between two guns , rather than in a cot in an officer ’ s cabin or in a screened - off corner of the sick bay ). in that explanation , “ gun ” refers to “ soldier ” ( equating arms with the man , as it were ), making any soldier ’ s or sailor ’ s male child — conceived in wedlock or not — a “ son of a gun .” alliteration ( repetition of sounds ) and well - cadenced rhymes were just as well - loved centuries ago as they are now , thus our forefathers would have delighted in “ son of a gun ’ s ” inherent ear appeal in the same way we were slyly pleased by “ the thrilla in manila ” and “ in like flynn .”
false	on 6 may 2016 , a fake news web site copied an 18 september 2015 article from a separate fake news outfit reporting that former subway spokesman jared fogle had been released from prison due to overcrowding : <PARA> the later version appeared to achieve more traction on social media than the first , leading many users to believe that fogel had been deemed a non - violent offender and re - sentenced to house arrest . but neither version of the story was true , as the footer of each page on the news nerd explained : <PARA> the news nerd previously published fake news items reporting that leonardo dicaprio planned to wear blackface to an upcoming martin luther king biopic , michael vick was attacked by a pit bull , george zimmerman was selling a painting of trayvon martin for $ 30 , 000 , and belief in god was classified as a mental illness by the american psychological association .
true	on 16 march 2019 , an image of president donald trump bestowing a purple heart decoration on a wounded veteran named clint trial went viral after a facebook user shared it along with the claim that the event “ didn ’ t make the news ”: <PARA> the text of the meme reads : “ the president awarding a purple heart to marine msgt clint trial . this didn ’ t make the news , share , because it should have .” <PARA> this is a genuine photograph of president trump awarding a purple heart to a wounded veteran reportedly named clint trial . while the majority of “ news media blackout ” claims that we ’ ve encountered — an allegation often levied in an attempt to either spread fake news or to push narratives of biased reporting — have proved false , in this case , it ’ s true that mainstream news outlets provided little ( if any ) coverage of this event . <PARA> so why didn ’ t this photograph make the news ? <PARA> while many social media users shared this image as “ evidence ” of the news media ’ s alleged bias against president trump , that claim wasn ’ t supported by what we found . if this were simply a case of “ liberally biased ” mainstream media outlets ignoring a positive story about president trump , we would still expect coverage of this event to turn up in conservative - leaning news outlets . however , we found almost no information about this veteran ’ s receiving a purple heart from president trump in any news outlets , regardless of their perceived political leanings . <PARA> the only article we could turn up was published in a pennsylvania newspaper , the titusville herald , on 16 february 2019 . that paper reported on the event not because of its national importance , but because of the pictured veteran ’ s family ties to saegertown , penn . <PARA> the report also contained an editor ’ s note explaining that the veteran ’ s surname was omitted due to a request for privacy : “* editor ’ s note : there are two clints referenced in this story . one , simply referred to as clint , is luke mcgill ’ s uncle , while the second is his father . the last names of clint and his wife , casey , have been omitted by request of the family for privacy .” <PARA> the event began with president trump ’ s visit to walter reed national military medical center in maryland in february 2019 for his annual physical . while there , the president met with a few of the wounded veterans who were being treated at that facility : <PARA> the titusville herald also reported that president trump ’ s visit with trial was unexpected , and that no members of the press were present at the meeting . in other words , president trump didn ’ t meet with this wounded veteran for a photo op or with the expectation of garnering positive news coverage . <PARA> the newspaper also reported that the photographs were taken by a white house photographer ( not a press photographer ) and were privately provided to the family as keepsakes : <PARA> we haven ’ t been able to track down the initial internet origins of this image , but it seems likely that the photograph was lifted from one of the personal social media pages of trial ( whose twitter account is now set to private ) or those of one of his relatives , and then turned into a meme and shared ( against his wishes for privacy ) with his full name . <PARA> this meme does not appear to demonstrate any news media “ bias ” against president trump but rather a private interaction that was never meant to receive press attention . president trump didn ’ t meet with this veteran for a photo opportunity , nor did the news media refuse to cover the event out of a desire to provide nothing but negative stories about the president . if anything , this meme seems to demonstrate that some social media users will exploit even wounded veterans in order to advance their own political viewpoints . <PARA> a gofundme campaign to help sgt . trial with his injuries was established in march 2019 :
false	examples : [ collected via e - mail , march 2013 ] <PARA> origins : this video ( how americans live today ) hit the internet in march 2013 as the “ greatest propaganda video ever ,” purportedly a north korean report on life in the united states showing how typical americans live in tents and streets and building corridors , drink coffee made from snow , are drug - dependent , and have denuded large areas of all forms of avian wildlife by eating ( yummy ) birds to fend off starvation . <PARA> the actual gist of the video is somewhat related to the subject presented in the english - language version , but the original features european countries such as romania rather than the u . s . ( a discrepancy addressed by the narrator ’ s noting that parts of america are “ often disguised as foreign countries in europe ”), and the english - language narration is nothing but a bit of satirical humor created by british travel writer alun hill ( who doesn ’ t himself speak korean ) rather than a literal translation . according to hill , the original video depicted a report on the failure of european democracy and was obtained by him from the [ north ] korean central news agency <PARA> although hill ’ s original posting of the video on youtube bore the title “ north korea comedy show : how americans live today , survive by eating birds and snow ” and was listed in the “ comedy ” and “ entertainment ” sections of that site , many viewers took it at face value because they encountered it out of context , because it ’ s difficult to come up with anything about the reclusive north korean nation that is too outlandish to be believed , and because those who questioned the video ’ s legitimacy were egged on by hill in youtube ’ s comments section .
false	a facebook post circulated in march 2019 that purported to offer a photograph of the heart of a child who died after contracting parasites from sleeping with and kissing a domesticated dog . “ a bad practice is to humanize pets . i ’ m sending you a kid ’ s heart that , due to sleeping and kissing his dog , it transmitted its parasites ,” the post warned . “ those parasites blocked his heart and he died here at the children ’ s hospital . please forward this to family and friends ”: <PARA> in fact , this photograph was taken from a 2012 paper published in the journal clinical microbiology reviews , where it was captioned as picturing “ male and female adult worms of d . immitis in the heart of a dog ,” not in the heart of a human child . <PARA> d . immitis ( or dirofilaria immitis ), commonly known as “ heartworm ” or “ dog heartworm ,” is a parasitic , thread - like roundworm that is spread via mosquito bites . d . immitis infections cause dirofilariasis ( also known as “ heartworm disease ”), which can be fatal to dogs if left untreated : “ d . immitis adult worms can cause pulmonary artery blockage in dogs , leading to an illness that can include cough , exhaustion upon exercise , fainting , coughing up blood , and severe weight loss .” <PARA> however , as the clinical microbiology reviews paper noted , “ humans are not suitable hosts for dirofilaria species ,” and one of that paper ’ s illustrations shows that dirofilaria infections in humans do not spread to the heart : <PARA> as the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) stated in an article about dirofilariasis , humans become infected with dirofilaria through mosquito bites ( not from physical contact with infected canines ); reported cases of infections in humans are quite uncommon ; and d . immitis worms are rarely found outside the lungs in humans : <PARA> a healthline article that specifically addresses the issue of “ can humans get heartworms from dogs ?” reiterates these same points — heartworm infections in humans are rare , aren ’ t transmitted by contact with dogs , don ’ t occur in the heart , and aren ’ t fatal : <PARA> in short , you can feel secure that your children ’ s cuddling the family dog will not result in any of them contracting a fatal case of heartworm .

false	during an interview with the new york times in july 2016 , u . s . supreme court associate justice ruth bader ginsburg said that she couldn ’ t imagine what the u . s . would be like with donald trump as president and joked about moving to new zealand in the event that he won the upcoming election : <PARA> embellished versions of ginsburg ’ s remarks quickly followed . for instance , the web site the rightists claimed that ginsburg had “ threatened to resign ” from the supreme court and relocate to the land of the long white cloud ”: <PARA> the rightists is a “ hybrid ” web site that publishes a mixture of fact and fiction . in this case , the quote that originated with the new york times interview was real , but ginsburg ’ s threat to resign was made up out of the whole cloth . <PARA> the fake news from the rightists was picked up by other disreputable web sites as the rumor gradually changed from ginsburg ’ s threatening to resign in the event of a trump victory , to ginsburg ’ s announcing her resignation after the election , to her actually retiring and moving to new zealand : <PARA> although articles published by success street ( and nearly identical versions can be found on other disreputable web sites such as rumor journal ) claimed that ginsburg had in fact resigned and moved to new zealand , they offered no evidence to back up those reports . instead , they based their articles on a fabricated quote that originated in a months - old piece of “ satire .” <PARA> on 23 february 2017 , more than two weeks after success street claimed that ginsburg had resigned and moved to new zealand , the supreme court justice appeared on bbc ’ s “ newsnight ” to talk about the future of the u . s . — with no mention that she would be a passive observer of those events from her retirement spot in new zealand :

false	examples : [ collected via e - mail , february 2012 ] <PARA> eric bolling ( fox business channel ’ s “ follow the money ”) test drove the chevy volt at the invitation of general motors . <PARA> for four days in a row , the fully charged battery lasted only 25 miles before the volt switched to the reserve gasoline engine . eric calculated the car got 30 mpg including the 25 miles it ran on the battery . so , the range including the 9 gallon gas tank and the 16 kwh battery is approximately 270 miles . it will take you 4 1 / 2 hours to drive 270 miles at 60 mph . then add 10 hours to charge the battery and you have a total trip time of 14 . 5 hours . in a typical road trip your average speed ( including charging time ) would be 20 mph . <PARA> according to general motors , the volt battery holds 16 kwh of electricity . it takes a full 10 hours to charge a drained battery . <PARA> the cost for the electricity to charge the volt is never mentioned so i looked up what i pay for electricity . <PARA> i pay approximately ( it varies with amount used and the seasons ) $ 1 . 16 per kwh . <PARA> – 16 kwh x $ 1 . 16 per kwh = $ 18 . 56 to charge the battery . <PARA> $ 18 . 56 per charge divided by 25 miles = $ 0 . 74 per mile to operate the volt using the battery . <PARA> compare this to a similar size car equipped with only a 4 cylinder gasoline engine that gets 32 mpg . <PARA> – $ 3 . 19 per gallon divided by 32 mpg = $ 0 . 10 per mile . <PARA> the gasoline powered car cost about $ 15 , 000 while the volt costs $ 46 , 000 . <PARA> so obama wants us to pay 3 times as much for a car that costs more that 7 times as much to run and takes 3 times as long to drive across country . <PARA> really ? no wonder gm is having trouble selling the volt ! <PARA> origins : in february 2012 , eric bolling did test drive a chevy volt and report on his experience for fox news , noting ( among other factors ) that the volt took 12 hours to charge and ran for only about 25 miles before discharging the battery and switching over to the gasoline engine , aspects he found particularly disappointing for an automobile that cost $ 46 , 500 and was heavily subsidized with taxpayer money : <PARA> however , this criticism somewhat misses the mark , as the chevy volt is not intended to be a car drivable for long distances in electric vehicle ( ev ) mode : it ’ s a niche vehicle that attempts to offset the current ev issues of limited range and scarcity of charging stations by combining ev capabilities with a gasoline engine to provide enough battery range to satisfy many consumers ’ daily driving needs while also accommodating extended travel beyond that range . as noted in car and driver ‘ s full test report on the 2011 chevrolet volt : <PARA> the volt sets itself apart from the nissan leaf and the forthcoming ev crowd : it also has a gas engine that can step in to extend the volt ’ s range when the battery ’ s energy is depleted . <PARA> this is why gm calls the volt an “ extended - range electric vehicle ,” and the dual - power - source arrangement makes a lot of sense at a time when there ’ s precious little charging infrastructure . currently , 48 of 50 states have fewer than 10 charging stations , and even california ’ s relative abundance of 422 pales in comparison to its roughly 10 , 400 gas stations . in other words , it ’ s going to be some time before charging while at work or out on the town becomes the norm ; for now , evs ’ batteries will be replenished largely at home . and with maximum ranges in the 100 - mile neighborhood , good luck with any long - or even moderate - distance travel . and forget about having a pure electric as your only vehicle . <PARA> what if your family in california needs you to visit ? while a pure ev — needing long recharging sessions every 70 miles or so — will transport you back to the era of the monthlong road trip , the volt could easily drive across the country on gas when there ’ s no time or electricity available for recharging . closer to home , if this writer had been driving a leaf instead of a volt , i would have had to deal a blow of rejection to a five - year - old nephew whose birthday party was 60 miles distant , due to the lack of a place to charge while there . <PARA> and although the volt has both a gas engine and two electric motors — one primarily to power the wheels and a second to generate electricity from the gas engine — it is unlike any gas - electric hybrid on the road today : if charged sufficiently , it can operate continuously , at any speed , as an ev , without ever needing to switch on the gas engine . <PARA> this is why gm calls the volt an “ extended - range electric vehicle ,” and the dual - power - source arrangement makes a lot of sense at a time when there ’ s precious little charging infrastructure . currently , 48 of 50 states have fewer than 10 charging stations , and even california ’ s relative abundance of 422 pales in comparison to its roughly 10 , 400 gas stations . in other words , it ’ s going to be some time before charging while at work or out on the town becomes the norm ; for now , evs ’ batteries will be replenished largely at home . and with maximum ranges in the 100 - mile neighborhood , good luck with any long - or even moderate - distance travel . and forget about having a pure electric as your only vehicle . <PARA> what if your family in california needs you to visit ? while a pure ev — needing long recharging sessions every 70 miles or so — will transport you back to the era of the monthlong road trip , the volt could easily drive across the country on gas when there ’ s no time or electricity available for recharging . closer to home , if this writer had been driving a leaf instead of a volt , i would have had to deal a blow of rejection to a five - year - old nephew whose birthday party was 60 miles distant , due to the lack of a place to charge while there . <PARA> and although the volt has both a gas engine and two electric motors — one primarily to power the wheels and a second to generate electricity from the gas engine — it is unlike any gas - electric hybrid on the road today : if charged sufficiently , it can operate continuously , at any speed , as an ev , without ever needing to switch on the gas engine . <PARA> the e - mailed item reproduced above starts out by claiming that : <PARA> it will take you 4 1 / 2 hours to drive 270 miles at 60 mph . then add 10 hours to charge the battery and you have a total trip time of 14 . 5 hours . in a typical road trip your average speed ( including charging time ) would be 20 mph . <PARA> this statement is nonsensical , as time spent charging the volt ’ s battery has nothing to do with elapsed driving time ; recharging would be performed before the beginning and / or after the end of a trip . on an extended road trip , the volt ’ s driver certainly wouldn ’ t be stopping every 270 miles to spend 10 hours recharging the battery , as implied here — instead , under such circumstances the driver would simply refill the volt ’ s gas tank as needed and skip recharging the battery until the conclusion of the journey . <PARA> next , the portions of this item dealing with energy - related operating costs of the chevy volt are unrealistic because they are based on erroneous assumptions and energy prices not reflective of current norms . when empirical data and standard energy prices are used , the operating costs for the chevy volt compare favorably with standard gasoline - powered automobiles . <PARA> for starters , although the chevy volt stores 16 kwh of energy in its battery pack , it actually uses only 9 . 6 kwh for propulsion and about another 3 - 4 kwh during the charging process , so recharging the volt ’ s battery does not typically require a full 16 kwh of electricity . as car and driver found during their volt road tests : “ in our experience , using only standard - household 120 - volt power , it took about 13 . 4 kwh of electricity to replenish the volt ’ s 9 kwh of usable energy . using a 240 - volt setup instead is more efficient and would have boosted the mileage figure .” <PARA> as well , car and driver observed that the 25 mile electric - range figure for the volt was not an average mileage figure , but rather the product of worst - case scenario driving : <PARA> gm ’ s recently revised electric - range claim is 25 to 50 miles , and we ended up in the low to middle of that band . getting on the nearest highway and commuting with the 80 - mph flow of traffic — basically the worst - case scenario — yielded 26 miles ; a fairly spirited back - road loop netted 31 ; and a carefully modulated cruise below 60 mph pushed the figure into the upper 30s . <PARA> additionally , the figures given for the chevy volt above are calculated using a price of $ 1 . 16 per kwh ( kilowatt hour ) of electricity . although electricity costs vary from place to place , nowhere in the united states is the average residential <PARA> retail price of electricity anywhere close to $ 1 . 16 per kwh . the average consumer price for electricity in the united states in december 2011 was only $ 0 . 127 per kwh . using that average price as a baseline and factoring in the proper amount of battery charging time ( while maintaining a worst - case scenario mileage assumption ), the quoted figures work out as follows : <PARA> 13 . 4 kwh x $ 0 . 127 per kwh = $ 1 . 70 to charge the battery . <PARA> $ 1 . 70 per charge divided by 25 miles = $ 0 . 07 per mile to operate the volt using the battery . <PARA> $ 1 . 70 per charge divided by 25 miles = $ 0 . 07 per mile to operate the volt using the battery . <PARA> the national average price of a gallon of gasoline in the united states in february 2012 was $ 3 . 565 , quite a bit more than the $ 3 . 19 per gallon figure cited above , so using current average costs , the comparison to a conventional gasoline - powered automobile would work out as follows : <PARA> compare this to a similar size car equipped with only a 4 cylinder gasoline engine that gets 32 mpg . <PARA> $ 3 . 565 per gallon divided by 32 mpg = $ 0 . 11 per mile . <PARA> $ 3 . 565 per gallon divided by 32 mpg = $ 0 . 11 per mile . <PARA> so , according to the criteria used by the author of this item , rather than being a car that “ costs more than 7 times as much to run and takes 3 times as long to drive across country ” than a gasoline - powered 4 - cylinder car , the volt costs about one - third less to run ( in electric mode ) and takes the same amount of time to drive across country .
false	a photo purportedly showing an endangered animal known as a “ fennec hare ” has been circulating online since at least 2008 when it was created for a “ worth 1000 ” photoshop contest : <PARA> when the above - displayed image first appeared on the internet , it was titled “ kitty kitty bunny ,” winning first place in a “ sickening cute 4 ” photo manipulation contest . later , this fictional creature was dubbed the “ fennec hare ,” and was shared as an april fool ’ s joke in 2009 by the web site zoo borns : <PARA> while the above image is frequently shared along with the a portion of the april fool ’ s joke , the “ fennec hare ” is rarely tied back to zoo borns or worth 1000 . without this source information , many people falsely believe that the fennec hare is a real animal . as adorable as they might be , there is no such creature as a “ fennec hare ” ( although the fennec fox is real , with equally distinctive ears ).
mixture	in december 2016 , a message requesting that people pray for a young boy named dakota who was allegedly airlifted to a hospital after having a seizure was widely circulated on facebook : <PARA> although the verbiage of the message varied from post to post , all versions contained three basic elements — the boy ’ s name ( dakota ), a short account of an emergency situation ( he was airlifted to a hospital ), and a call to action ( please forward this message ): <PARA> many of the messages , such as the one reproduced above , also included some note <PARA> regarding a familial relation : <PARA> other messages were more specific and linked the prayer requests directly to another facebook user . those leads , however , also resulted in dead ends . nearly every message about dakota lacked credible information about where or when this incident occurred , but we did find a message posted to the prayer board of the woodland hills baptist church in longview , texas , which may have provided some additional details ( i . e ., the child ’ s full name and location ) about the situation : <PARA> however , this information was inaccurate . dakota wells was not the name of the young boy who was airlifted to the hospital , but rather the name of the facebook user who originally posted about the sick child . according to wells , the young boy ’ s name is waylon , her cousin , and he was airlifted to the university of mississippi medical center on 3 december 2016 : <PARA> a gofundme page set up for waylon wells provided a little more information about the situation : <PARA> dakota wells published pictures of waylon being held by family members on 6 december 2016 , three days after he was airlifted to the hospital . in early 2017 , an update on his condition was published to the gofundme campaign ’ s page along with clarifications pertaining to social media rumors . waylon was released from the hospital at the time the update was published , and ” doing [ great ]”: <PARA> although this prayer request most likely refers to waylon wells , the cousin of a “ dakota ” wells , it ’ s also possibly that this viral message refers to an incident in 2014 , when a baby named dakota when airlifted to a hospital in bismarck . this request has also been conflated with one seeking prayers for a child shot with a nail gun .
mixture	statistics are a common feature of online political debate , and statistical comparisons can often be a powerful rhetorical tool , especially if they are striking or unexpected — thereby forming the basis of eye - catching and “ shareable ” social media memes . <PARA> at the end of 2018 , one such meme sought to force readers to reevaluate their perception of various risks and harms in american society , arguing that when it comes to sheer fatalities , terrorism and the consequences of illegal immigration pale in comparison to a lack of affordable healthcare . the left - leaning “ teanderthal party ” facebook page posted a meme which contained the claim that “ more americans die every year from lack of affordable healthcare than from terrorist attacks and illegal immigration combined ”: <PARA> terrorist attacks are relatively very rare events in the united states and in recent years have resulted in a relatively very small number of fatalities . no single , universally - accepted definition of a terrorist attack exists , but the term ’ s distinguishing characteristic is that , roughly speaking , it describes an attack driven by some cause ( e . g ., political , religious , environmental ) rather than a criminal motive or personal grievance . <PARA> furthermore , except in cases of assassination , the victims of terrorist acts are typically not known or individually targeted in advance . they are either arbitrary ( for example the passengers of a commercial jet converted into a weapon by al - qaeda operatives and used to destroy the world trade center ) or part of a group which is symbolically targeted ( for example , worshippers at the sikh temple of wisconsin , where a neo - nazi assailant shot dead six people on the basis of their perceived religious faith , in 2012 ). <PARA> the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) defines terrorist acts as falling into two categories : <PARA> a couple of unofficial but robust sources of data on deaths from terrorist attacks in the united states have been active in recent years . the first is the national consortium for the study of terrorism and responses to terrorism ( start ), which is linked to the department of homeland security and led by the university of maryland .; <PARA> according to start figures , between 1995 and 2017 show 3 , 516 deaths associated with 694 terrorist attacks of all varieties ( international and domestic ), yielding a mean ( average ) of 153 deaths per year . however , around 3 , 000 of those fatalities were associated with a single set of events : the al - qaeda attacks of 11 september 2001 . <PARA> in order to find out what the typical number of deaths per year was during this period , we must calculate the median , a type of average that strips away the impact of outliers such as 9 / 11 . the median ( or typical ) annual number of terrorism - related deaths in the united states between 1995 and 2017 was four — a number that makes sense when one considers that in 10 of the 23 years in question the number of deaths was fewer than three . <PARA> if we focus in on the five most recent years ( 2013 - 2017 ), we find a clear increase in the number of terrorism - related deaths , with 266 in total and an annual average of 53 . the median ( typical ) number of deaths per year was 54 during this period . <PARA> the second source is a major report published in 2016 by the conservative - leaning think thank the cato institute . their “ terrorism and immigration risk analysis ” collated data from nine different sources but focused exclusively on terrorist acts perpetrated by foreign - born assailants in the united states . <PARA> according to the report , between 1975 and 2015 a total of 2 , 983 deaths occurred that were related to terrorist attacks perpetrated by non - u . s . born attackers . unsurprisingly , the overwhelming majority of these resulted from the september 11th attacks . <PARA> these numbers work out to an average of 73 deaths related to foreign - perpetrated terrorism , but it ’ s important to note that in 30 out of the 41 years in question not a single such death occurred , and the median ( typical ) annual number of deaths relating to foreign terrorism was actually zero . <PARA> it ’ s not made explicit , but the meme ’ s mention of illegal immigration is almost certainly a reference to homicides committed by undocumented immigrants within the united states , something that is often talked up as a threat by those in favor of stricter immigration enforcement and border security , not least of all president donald trump . <PARA> several studies have shown that undocumented immigrants actually commit crime in general at a lower rate than native - born americans . we examined that research in greater depth previously . <PARA> when it comes to the number of homicides attributed to undocumented immigrants , the numbers are less clear , but we do have some indicative data . in 2011 , the government accountability office , an objective and non - partisan federal auditing and research agency , published a study on arrests and incarceration among immigrants in the united states . <PARA> the study concluded that between 1955 and 2010 , a total of 25 , 064 arrests took place of undocumented immigrants on homicide charges . we don ’ t know what proportion of those arrests advanced to prosecutions , and from there to convictions , but even the highest possible conversion rate of 100 percent would mean there an average of 448 undocumented immigrants per year were convicted of homicides in the united states between 1955 and 2010 . <PARA> of course , the actual number is likely to be significantly lower than that , since only some arrests will lead to prosecutions , and only some prosecutions will lead to convictions . <PARA> in 2018 , the cato institute published a report on the rates of arrest and conviction among immigrants in texas on charges of homicide , sex crimes , and other serious offenses . the report concluded that , in general , legal and undocumented immigrants committed crime at lower rates than native - born americans . <PARA> in particular , the report found that undocumented immigrants accounted for 5 . 9 percent of homicide convictions in texas in 2015 , despite making up 6 . 4 percent of the state ’ s population . legal immigrants accounted for just 3 . 8 percent of homicide convictions , despite making up 10 . 6 percent of the state ’ s population . by contrast , native - born americans accounted for 90 . 3 percent of homicide convictions in 2015 , despite making up 83 percent of the texas population . <PARA> the rate of homicide conviction among undocumented immigrants in texas in 2015 was 2 . 6 convictions for every 100 , 000 immigrants . if one were to extrapolate from that rate on to the national level , it would work out as 286 homicide convictions of undocumented immigrants in the united states , in 2015 , based on an estimated undocumented immigrant population of 11 million . <PARA> even if , for some reason , the rate of homicide conviction were remarkably low in texas — one third the national rate , for the sake of argument — that would still equate to fewer than 1 , 000 homicide convictions ( 858 ) of undocumented migrants in the united states in 2015 . <PARA> if the rate of undocumented - immigrant homicide convictions is the same nationwide as it is in texas , and if we accept start ’ s annual average of 153 deaths caused by terrorism per year ( even though the average in the last five years has been significantly lower at 53 ), this gives us a combined total of 439 deaths per year caused by terrorism and undocumented - immigrant homicide . <PARA> if one allows for the possibility that the rate of undocumented immigrant homicide conviction might be ( for the sake of argument ) three times higher nationwide than it is in texas , this yields a combined total of 1 , 011 deaths per year . the question now is , does that number outstrip the number of deaths caused by a lack of affordable healthcare each year ? <PARA> recent debates about healthcare in general , and former president barack obama ’ s affordable care act ( obamacare ) in particular , have often featured claims about the number of avoidable deaths caused by a lack of affordable healthcare . <PARA> the estimates have varied . a 2009 study in the american journal of public health reckoned that 44 , 789 deaths in the united states in 2005 were associated with a lack of health insurance . <PARA> in 2016 , the left - leaning web site thinkprogress calculated that the repeal of obamacare could cause as many as 36 , 000 deaths per year , based on an estimate that almost 30 million people would lose their health insurance under such a scenario , and after applying the conclusions of a 2014 study from the annals of internal medicine , which found that the introduction of affordable health insurance in massachusetts in 2007 prevented one death for every 830 individuals who became insured under the program . <PARA> using the same 2014 study as their basis , president obama ’ s council of economic advisers estimated in december 2016 that the provisions of the affordable care act were saving around 24 , 000 lives per year . <PARA> others have pointed out the flaws in such estimates , not least the difficulty in precisely attributing a lack of health insurance as the primary direct cause of a particular individual ’ s death . in particular , a 2009 study in the journal health services research concluded that : “ adjusted for demographic , health status , and health behavior characteristics , the risk of subsequent mortality is no different for uninsured respondents than for those covered by employer ‐ sponsored group insurance ...” in other words , the study found that lack of health insurance did not cause any otherwise avoidable premature deaths . <PARA> however , another study that challenged the methodology of earlier estimates and found them to be excessively high still arrived at the conclusion that those who could not afford private health insurance were 3 . 7 percent more likely to suffer an avoidable death than those who had private health insurance , a ratio that would equate to a significant number of avoidable deaths per year on a national level . <PARA> it does seem unlikely that the unavailability of affordable healthcare to many u . s . residents accounts for fewer than 1 , 000 deaths each year — the very high estimate we arrived at as the combined number of deaths attributable to acts of terrorism and homicides perpetrated by undocumented immigrants . <PARA> it is also undoubtable that terrorist acts and homicides committed by undocumented immigrants account for a relatively very small portion of all violent deaths in the united states , and certainly a smaller share than might appear to be the case , based on the intense media and political scrutiny they attract . <PARA> however , it ’ s unlikely that any research model could arrive at a definitive estimate of the number of people who die premature and avoidable deaths each year as a result of their inability to access health insurance . this is partly due to the inherent complexities and ambiguities involved in that question . <PARA> furthermore , we must take into account the absence of uniformly - accepted estimates on the number of fatalities caused by the lack of affordable healthcare , and the existence of at least one peer - reviewed study which concluded that lacking insurance did not cause any substantive difference in the number of deaths . <PARA> for those reasons , we give a mixed verdict to the claim in the meme , that “ more americans die every year from lack of affordable healthcare than from terrorist attacks and illegal immigration combined .”
mixture	a small newspaper in east texas ran afoul of facebook ’ s algorithms in the summer of 2018 , after their posting portions of the declaration of independence for the july 4 holiday was deemed to have violated the social network ’ s hate speech standards . <PARA> in the run - up to independence day , the vindicator newspaper , which serves liberty county , about 40 miles north - east of houston , published the text of the declaration of independence on their facebook page , in twelve separate posts between 24 june and 4 july . <PARA> according to the vindicator ( information that was later corroborated by a facebook spokesperson ) the tenth excerpt did not appear on the newspaper ’ s facebook page , despite being scheduled to publish on 2 july . the text of that post read as follows : <PARA> in their article ( published under the headline “ facebook ’ s program thinks declaration of independence is hate speech ”) the vindicator reported that : <PARA> the following day , facebook restored the post in question and apologized to the vindicator in an email the newspaper quoted as follows : <PARA> a spokesperson for the social network told us that “ the post was removed by mistake and restored as soon as we looked into it . we process millions of reports each week , and sometimes we get things wrong .” <PARA> the vindicator ‘ s managing editor casey stinnett speculated that facebook ’ s algorithms were alerted by the use of the phrase “ indian savages ” in the excerpt from the declaration , something that a spokesperson for the social network confirmed to us in an email , noting that context is crucial in how facebook evaluates potential hate speech and bigoted slurs . <PARA> that the phrase “ indian savages ” could be hate speech , depending upon the context in which it appeared , was not disputed even by observers who were critical of facebook in this episode , such as the libertarian web site reason : <PARA> neither facebook ’ s algorithms nor their employees labelled the declaration of independence , as a whole , as hate speech . headlines in some news reports ( including the vindicator ‘ s own ) have been misleading in this respect , suggesting that the social network had determined the entire text of the document was in violation of facebook standards . however , the other eleven out of twelve excerpts from the document did not alert even facebook ’ s automated standards filters .
mixture	what ’ s true : on 22 november 2015 , 17 people were shot and injured at bunny friend playground in new orleans . <PARA> what ’ s false / undetermined : the event was a “ mass shooting ” by commonly defined terms , the media didn ’ t report it . <PARA> origins : on 30 november 2015 the web site mad world news published an article titled “ there was a giant mass shooting nobody ’ s talking about , care to guess why ?,” claiming a 22 november 2015 “ giant mass shooting ” at bunny friend playground in new orleans was “ ignor [ ed ]” by the media : <PARA> the article correctly described some factual elements of the incident , but distorted a number of details . on 22 november 2015 , what was described by credible news sources as a “ gunfight ” erupted during a large event at bunny friend playground in new orleans . the day of the shooting the new orleans advocate reported a “ hail of gunfire ” between “ two unidentified groups ” erupted at the public park , adding that “ multiple gunmen [ were ] shooting at each other .” <PARA> information about the 22 november 2015 shooting at bunny friend playground was in fact easy to come by , as the incident was reported on extensively by both local and national news outlets . initial reporting alone ( not counting follow up reports on arrests ) generated hundreds of articles in google news ; among sites which covered the shooting were usa today , people , foxnews . com , nbcnews . com , daily mail , the new york times , new york daily news , ksla , wwl - tv , the times - picayune , and the atlanta journal - constitution . not only was it clear the media hadn ’ t colluded to “ bury ” the story , but most coverage included a mug shot of allen ( clearly not downplaying the fact the suspect was black .) <PARA> another misrepresentation in mad world news ‘ article involved the “ giant mass shooting ” it described . while 17 people were wounded ( no one was killed ) in the bunny friend playground incident , “ mass shooting ” is a term generally used in an entirely different manner : <PARA> by all accounts , the bunny friend playground incident didn ’ t match any of the criteria for a “ mass shooting .” law enforcement , the media , and officials described a large and dangerous outbreak of street violence , involving several armed individuals firing indiscriminately at one another . <PARA> along with mad world news , several social media users contrasted the shooting in new orleans with a subsequent mass shooting at a colorado planned parenthood . however , that incident involved a sole gunman , lacked an altercation , and the clinic appeared to specifically be the suspected shooter ’ s target ( three people were killed , so the incident might not technically be classed as a “ mass shooting .”) <PARA> it ’ s true that on 22 november 2015 , 17 people were wounded during an altercation at bunny friend playground . it ’ s similarly true that the subsequent 27 november 2015 shooting at a colorado planned parenthood received more media coverage . however , the initial new orleans incident was widely covered locally , nationally , and internationally ; the better part of a week passed before the planned parenthood shooting became then - current news . <PARA> the bunny friend playground incident was further not in any way classifiable as a “ mass shooting ,” whereas the planned parenthood shooting did fall under many of the accepted descriptors . no one died in the first shooting , whereas three people were killed at the colorado springs planned parenthood . finally , it was absurd to suggest a “ media blackout ” suppressed the story , as outlets in the u . s . and united kingdom reported it . <PARA> originally published : 3 december 2015
true	in july 2011 , discussion about raising the debt ceiling heated up as the august 2nd deadline for resolving the issue and avoiding a shutdown of the federal government loomed . ( had the matter not been resolved , as of that date the u . s . would have been unable to fund its various programs and other expenditures .) <PARA> opinions about what should be done were sought from various quarters as news organizations struggled to keep up with the battle waging in congress and behind closed doors . business magnate warren buffett waded in with his opinion on the matter in an early - morning 7 july 2011 cnbc interview conducted by becky quick . it was during that exchange that the oracle of omaha made his now famous statement about rendering ineligible for re - election all sitting members of congress whenever the deficit exceeded 3 % of gross domestic product . <PARA> so yes , it ’ s true that one of the most respected businessmen of modern times did indeed voice the quote now widely ascribed to him in various e - mailed forwards , although his remark was more in the nature of a wry commentary on the workings of congress than a serious proposal for tackling the budget deficit . <PARA> the rest of the lengthier e - mail in circulation ( see example quoted below ) has nothing to do with warren buffett . what is presented as the “ congressional reform act of 2011 ” began circulating on the internet in october 2009 as the “ congressional reform act of 2009 .” in a nutshell , what is presented as a proposed 28th amendment to the u . s . constitution isn ’ t something that has been put forward by any member of congress and thus is nothing more than a bit of internet - based politicking . for the non - nutshell version , our article about the supposed 28th amendment deals with the item in depth . <PARA> warren buffett is most certainly not asking folks to forward the e - mail to others — that claim was added to the piece by an unknown party .
false	“ a meeting is an event where minutes are taken and hours wasted .” — james t . kirk <PARA> which they attribute to william shatner ’ s character of james t . kirk from the original series of star trek . <PARA> i ’ ve done an exhaustive search for this quote covering everything related to the series or even to the character of james t . kirk and have not found it at all . <PARA> where did this come from , if you google this it will show up on many websites . <PARA> origins : verifying whether a particular person was responsible for a quote commonly attributed to him generally involves searching material ( e . g ., books , news accounts , personal papers ) that has recorded the various utterances , speeches , letters , and other writings made by that person during his lifetime . determining whether a fictional character should truly be credited as the original source of a particular quote is a different matter , however , because anyone can put words in the mouth of a fictional character , and therefore such debates often devolve into arguments over how “ official ” a given source is . ( for example , if an actor portraying sherlock holmes in a film speaks words that appear nowhere in the original writings of sir arthur conan doyle , can one maintain that sherlock holmes actually “ said ” them , or does only material from the sherlock holmes canon count ?) <PARA> such is the issue with the quote referenced above , “ a meeting is an event where minutes are taken and hours wasted ,” which is widely credited ( on the internet and in several business - related <PARA> books ) to james t . kirk , captain of the uss enterprise in the original star trek television series . if these words were not spoken by james kirk in any star trek television episode or film , but were only attributed to him in a secondary work such as a star trek novel or desk calendar , can we maintain he really said them , or would it be a case of someone else ’ s putting words into his mouth ? <PARA> fortunately , we don ’ t have to make that distinction here . quote verification is understood to be about determining whether a particular person was the first one to use those words , and in this case captain kirk fails to pass the test . the kirk character first appeared with the debut of star trek on television in september 1966 , but expressions of the “ minutes are taken and hours are wasted ” phrase can be found in sources from well before 1966 ( such as this 1961 business book ). additionally , the same sentiment has long been expressed with slightly different wording — “ a committee is a group that keeps minutes and loses hours ” — and commonly attributed to comedian milton berle , who also long antedates the first appearance of captain kirk ( although the phrase likely didn ’ t originate with berle either , as he was known for liberally borrowing material from others ). <PARA> as for whether james t . kirk ever “ said ” these words ( whether he was the first to do so or not ), we haven ’ t uncovered any evidence that he did . although it ’ s easy to find hundreds and hundreds of attributions to kirk for “ a meeting is an event where minutes are taken and hours wasted ,” we haven ’ t located a single one that provided any more specific source information . we know james t . kirk didn ’ t speak this line in any star trek television episode or movie , and we haven ’ t turned up this bit of dialogue in any star trek - related novelization . how and when this aphorism came to be credited to a fictional starship captain remains a mystery to us for now .
false	on sept . 30 , 2019 , the snickersee website published an article positing that the population of dolphins in lake michigan was on the rise . <PARA> this item was not a factual recounting of real - life events . the article originated with a website that describes its output as being humorous or satirical in nature , as follows : <PARA> this snickersee article follows in a long tradition of rumors about whales , sharks , and other ocean animals inhabiting the fresh water great lakes . in may 2017 , for instance , we encountered a fake photograph of a large whale swimming beneath the mackinac bridge , which stretches between the upper and lower peninsulas of michigan across the straits of mackinac . in october 2015 , a genuine photograph of a shark caught off the coast of florida was recaptioned and shared as if the large ocean predator was found off the shores of muskegon , michigan . <PARA> but this bit of local ( and fictional ) lore can be traced back to at least 1985 , when a group of people set out on the first annual great lakes whale watch . no whales were seen during this tour and the event was largely meant to raise awareness about the plight of whales ( and the oceans in general ), not to spot a whale in lake michigan . <PARA> lastly , it should be noted that the photograph used in the snickersee article which supposedly shows two dolphins jumping out of lake michigan in front of navy pier is a fake . here ’ s a comparison between the doctored image ( left ) and the original photograph ( right ): <PARA> according to the minnesota sea grant , “ there are no whales , no dolphins or sharks , and no squid in the great lakes .” <PARA> for background , here is why we sometimes write about satire / humor .
false	in january 2018 , at the height of a severe flu season in the united states , reports emerged that first lady melania trump had supposedly banned members of the white house staff from receiving flu vaccinations . she allegedly issued the order after learning of the “ adverse health effects ” of flu shots . <PARA> these claims turned up on a number of disreputable web sites , but their point of origin was a consistent purveyor of fake news and political disinformation , your news wire ( now news punch ), who “ reported ” on 22 january that : <PARA> if melania trump actually imposed such a ban or expressed such views , it went entirely unnoticed by legitimate news outlets , who would have reported on these alleged actions if they had taken place , especially given the controversial subject matter . <PARA> we doubt , moreover , that the first lady has the power to order hundreds of white house employees to forego a preventative medical treatment that the u . s . government recommends that every american six months of age or older receive . <PARA> far from being “ pushed so hard by the media ” as the article alleges , the recommendation that everyone should get a flu shot is the official position of the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ), the federal health agency run by brenda fitzgerald , a trump appointee . <PARA> according to the cdc web site : <PARA> among the many other tidbits of flu vaccine misinformation the article trumpeted were the claims that the 2018 variant of the vaccine was only 10 percent effective ( false : the cdc said that figure came from australia and was an interim estimate of its effectiveness against one flu strain only ) and that it “ may be responsible for spreading serious cases of influenza ” ( false : the cdc says flu vaccines cannot cause or spread influenza ). <PARA> in short , like most yournewswire articles , this one is entirely fictitious and aimed not at informing the public , but rather at attracting traffic and advertising revenue to the web site . previous examples in this vein include melania trump bans monsanto products from the white house and bill gates admits vaccinations are designed so governments can depopulate the world .

true	a video supposedly showing a tiger emerging from the woods to briefly chase a motorcycle went viral online near the end of june 2019 : <PARA> this footage was met with some skepticism as it circulated on social media . after all , this wouldn ’ t be the first time a piece of doctored media purportedly showing a close encounter with a wild animal has gone viral . but unlike some of the fake videos and photographs we ’ ve debunked in the past , the above - displayed video showed no obvious red flags that it was fake . <PARA> for instance , instead of originating with an anonymous user on social media , this video comes from a seemingly authoritative source : the facebook page for the “ forests and wildlife protection society ( fawps ),” a nongovernmental organization from the telangana state in india . <PARA> fawps posted this video on 28 june 2019 along with the caption : “ a tiger is seen chasing a bike in muthanga wildlife safari in wayanad in kerala . is this how the tiger parks are managed in india ?” <PARA> furthermore , this source provided additional details about the video when news reporters asked about it . while we were unable to connect with fawps by publication time , a spokesperson for the facebook group talked to the hindustan times and explained that the footage was taken by two forest - department officials who were patrolling the area after receiving a tip about a tiger sighting . <PARA> the footage itself also avoids some of the common editing tricks used to create fake footage . for instance , once the tiger comes into frame , the camera person does a good job of keeping the camera focused on the animal . an amateur filmmaker attempting to fake similar footage may employ a shakier camera that only shows the tiger a few frames at a time . this can help cover up any editing mistakes on a digitally created animal . <PARA> take the following video for example . in december 2014 , a video supposedly showing a bear chasing a bike through the woods went viral . that video , which was a digitally edited hoax , only gives a few brief glances at the bear : <PARA> we don ’ t see any reason to doubt the footage of a tiger briefly chasing after a motorcycle . this video was filmed by two forest officials as they rode through a wildlife sanctuary in india . while this footage may seem quite scary , conservationist prerna singh bindra faulted the officers for not being cautious enough while driving through an area with tigers and claimed that the animal was “ mock charging ,” not attacking , the motorcycle as it rode through the animal ’ s territory :

mixture	in october 2018 , a mass shooting at a synagogue in pittsburgh , pennsylvania prompted widespread concern about anti - semitic violence and the influence of right - wing conspiracy theories as police arrested robert bowers in connection with that shooting , a man who had posted vehemently anti - semitic slurs and conspiracy theories on social media . <PARA> attention also turned to the response of president donald trump to the shooting , in which eleven people were killed at the tree of life synagogue in the squirrel hill neighborhood of pittsburgh on 27 october . later that day , president trump spoke at the annual future farmers of america ( ffa ) convention in indianapolis , indiana , and began his speech by talking about the mass shooting in pittsburgh , calling it a “ wicked act of mass murder ” and “ pure evil ”: <PARA> in the days following the shooting and president trump ’ s response to it , reports emerged that singer / songwriter and music producer pharrell williams had been unhappy with another aspect of trump ’ s appearance at the ffa convention : his alleged use of williams ’ song “ happy ,” of which the hollywood reporter wrote : <PARA> for their part , slate declared in their headline that “ trump played ‘ happy ’ at a rally hours after the pittsburgh shooting , and pharrell is not ok with it ,” and stated that the song was played at a rally in illinois , not indiana : <PARA> williams ’ letter also formed the basis of segments on the late night shows of jimmy kimmel and stephen colbert , both of whom claimed that trump had been responsible for the use of the song “ happy ” before his speech at the ffa convention in indianapolis : <PARA> analysis <PARA> it ’ s true that howard king , a high - profile entertainment lawyer who has represented hugely successful musical artists and acts including metallica and dr dre , did indeed send president trump a “ cease and desist ” letter on behalf of his client pharrell williams , accusing trump of having played the song “ happy ” at “ a political event in indiana .” <PARA> king ’ s law firm sent us a copy of the letter , which read as follows : <PARA> the letter is undoubtedly authentic , and williams ’ demand that trump never use any of his music , on pain of legal action , is real . however , a few significant factual problems exist with the allegations contained in the letter , as well as some of the subsequent news media coverage of it . <PARA> first , neither the white house nor president trump himself was responsible for the playing of the song “ happy ” at the ffa convention on 27 october 2018 . that decision was made by the organizers of the event ( and generally the operators of a venue are the ones responsible for rights clearance and royalty payments associated with the use of music played during events held there ). <PARA> we tracked down video footage which shows that a live , instrumental version of the song “ happy ” ( not pharrell williams ’ own recording of it ) was played in the auditorium at the bankers life fieldhouse , around 25 minutes before president trump ’ s speech began . the event was streamed live on facebook by mercedes heiner , and the use of “ happy ” can be heard in the first four minutes of that video stream : <PARA> the allegation contained in williams ’ letter , and the subsequent news coverage highlighted above , was that either the white house or trump himself had “ played ” the song or had at least been responsible for its use . this is false : that decision was made by the organizers of the ffa convention . <PARA> second , it ’ s not accurate to describe trump ’ s ffa speech as being part of a “ rally ” or “ political event .” he was speaking in his capacity as president of the united states at the annual national ffa convention . the event was organized by the national ffa organization and president trump was an invited guest there ; it was not a political or partisan rally . the ffa spokesperson also emphasized that point in their response to our questions . <PARA> furthermore , some confusion was evident in the reporting about where the song “ happy ” was played . slate wrote that trump had been responsible for playing the song at a “ campaign rally in illinois ,” but this does not appear to be true . <PARA> trump did speak at a political rally in murphysboro , illinois , later on 27 october , but we could find no evidence that the song “ happy ” was played there despite our checking almost two hours of footage covering the period from the build - up to his speech . <PARA> a viral tweet posted by anti - gun violence activist shannon watts falsely claimed that president trump had walked on stage to the song “ happy .” this is also false : trump walked on stage to the song “ god bless the u . s . a .” by lee greenwood , as shown in another live facebook video recorded by a convention attendee : <PARA> this was a particularly misleading passage , because although the president did make the comments attributed to him in his interview with ingraham , absolutely no reference to the song “ happy ” had occurred during the interview up to that point . rather , president trump was offering an explanation for why he decided to go ahead with his engagements in indianapolis and illinois in the wake of the synagogue shooting :

false	a touching appeal to help save a young life began circulating in e - mail and as a cell phone text message in february 2010 : <PARA> although the story was fresh at the time ( brave adolescent interrupts evil step - father intent upon raping the boy ’ s toddler sister and gets shot six times for his trouble ), it was the same old hoax underneath : there was no such youngster whose life - saving medical care would be funded by at & t on a per - text - forwarded basis . despite the message ’ s providing a date for when the shooting supposedly occurred and ( in the second version quoted above ) a name for the victim , the boy whom people are being encouraged to help is fictional . ( the second version also upped the ante to $ 12 . 00 per forward and dragged verizon into the fray , while a third version added “ facebook companies ” to the mix .) <PARA> as demonstrated so aptly by public efforts to provide relief to earthquake victims in haiti , beneficences initiated by cell phone generally involve a tracking and billing mechanism that requires participants to text a specific short word or phrase to a particular ( five - digit ) number , not the willy - nilly forwarding of a explanatory narrative to as many people as possible . <PARA> in 2009 we began to note that “ forward this message to help fund medical care for a sick or dying child ” appeals were beginning to appear as cell phone text messages as well as being passed in e - mail . that trend continues into 2010 , with the “ shot 14 - year - old boy ” just another iteration of the same basic hoax that falsely claims the american cancer society , the make - a - wish foundation , or some other large entity will donate a predetermined amount of money every time a particular message is forwarded . such leg - pulls have been circulating via e - mail since 1997 . <PARA> typically , a large charity is named as the benefactor standing ready to direct monies towards the costs of medical care for the languishing child , but various corporations have also been fingered for this role in other iterations of the hoax , such as aol and zdnet in the rachel arlington leg pull ( brain cancer sufferer in need of an operation ) and mcdonald ’ s and pizza hut in the justin mallory prank ( epileptic in need of long - term care ). <PARA> everyone wants to help sick children get better , and the thought of a little boy or girl suffering from some dread disease or infirmity because people couldn ’ t be bothered to forward a message tugs straight at the heartstrings . problem is , hoaxsters know that , and they play upon these very human drives for their personal amusement . once again , that is the case here : well - intentioned forwarding does nothing towards helping a sick child ; it does , however , make the day of some prankster . <PARA> if you want to make a difference in a sick child ’ s life , the best way is still the old - fashioned one : donate your money or your time , not a worthless text message .
mixture	when economic conditions are tough and / or the price of gasoline rises substantially , the suggestion that already financially pinched consumers aren ’ t even getting a fair shake at the pump is enough to make anyone see red . so , it ’ s not surprising that the warning quoted below and its variations about “ cheating at gas pumps ” quickly gained widespread currency in april 2008 as gasoline prices edged towards $ 4 . 00 per gallon , and began hitting inboxes again during an ongoing economic downturn in may 2009 : <PARA> examples : <PARA> variations : <PARA> it ’ s difficult to verify whether some anonymous person in georgia truly encountered a malfunctioning gas pump one day in april 2008 ( and whether his report of same was accurate ), but the georgia department of agriculture told us at that time that the pumps at the station referenced in the quoted e - mail had been checked by that agency ’ s fuel and measures section in november 2007 and were re - checked ( in response to this e - mail ) in may 2008 , and in both cases they were found to be operating according to standards : <PARA> since this message conflates two distinctly different issues ( whether gas pumps accurately report the amount of gasoline dispensed vs . whether gas pumps accurately register the proper charge for the amount of gasoline dispensed ), we ’ ll address them by discussing some general factors involved in the dispensing of gasoline . <PARA> vendors of gasoline are subject to a variety of state and federal laws requiring them to maintain adequately calibrated dispensing equipment and calling for periodic inspections by government regulatory agencies to ensure that they are in compliance with said laws . however , this does not guarantee that every gas pump you might encounter will necessarily be accurate , for a variety of reasons : some agencies may not have the funds to regularly carry out required inspections at every location , regulators ’ equipment might itself be inaccurate , understaffed agencies may not be able to adequately enforce compliance with regulations , etc . <PARA> furthermore , instances of malfunctioning or improperly calibrated pumps are not necessarily indicators that a particular gasoline vendor is “ cheating .” such irregularities may be due to worn - out equipment which can be difficult to spot ( and is about as likely to cheat the vendor as it is the customer ), such as the common occurrence of worn check valves : <PARA> unfortunately , much of the responsibility for spotting such irregularities and reporting them to regulatory agencies falls upon consumers themselves , and it isn ’ t always easy for the average consumer to notice problems like the ones described in the above - quoted message . determining whether a particular pump is correctly reporting the amount of gasoline dispensed can be rather difficult , especially if the difference is relatively small — just about all consumers can do in this area is to be aware of how much gasoline their vehicles should take at various fuel gauge level readings and note whether the reported number of gallons they buy corresponds to this number . ( that is , if you know your car typically takes seven gallons to fill when your gas gauge needle is on the halfway mark , you should be concerned if a half - tank fill - up suddenly takes eight or nine gallons instead . note that you need to learn this system by trial and error : because gas gauge needles do not necessarily move at an even rate across the full range between “ f ” and “ e ”, you can ’ t assume that a car with a 14 - gallon gas tank will necessarily take exactly seven gallons to fill when the needle sits on the halfway mark .) <PARA> it ’ s much easier to determine whether pumps are accurately registering the proper charge for the amount of gasoline dispensed simply by multiplying the number of gallons you buy by the price per gallon . ( if you can ’ t easily do this calculation in your head , you can either use a calculator or employ the suggested method of noting the total dollar charge at the moment the pump reads exactly ten gallons dispensed .) but of course , catching this sort of problem is only possible if the pump is accurately reporting the amount of gasoline dispensed , which , as noted above , is usually much more difficult to determine .

false	numerology is a common source of online misinformation and unreliable memes . the belief that certain numbers or numerical patterns hold mystical powers has been involved in conspiracy theories about terrorist attacks , hurricanes and world war ii leaders . <PARA> equally , internet users often spread much more trivial and less sinister claims about hidden numerical patterns and coincidences . <PARA> in september 2018 , an old and recurring example of this phenomenon gained popularity on facebook , instagram and twitter , with images claiming that “ only today your age + year of birth . the total will be 2018 . this only happens every 1000 years ”: <PARA> most readers who performed this calculation will have found it to be true . the reason for this is not some mysterious , once - a - millennium event , but rather simple mathematics . <PARA> if i am 18 years old and i was born in the year 2000 , adding 18 and 2 , 000 will yield 2 , 018 . equally , if i am 40 years old and i was born in the year 1978 , adding 40 to 1 , 978 will also give me 2 , 018 . <PARA> the “ trick ,” such as it is , only works if your birthday has already taken place in 2018 . in october 2018 , someone born in november 2000 is still only 17 years old , just as someone born in november 1978 is still 39 years old — in both cases the calculation yields a total of 2 , 017 rather than 2 , 018 . <PARA> in logical terms , the reason this meme sometimes tricks people into believing they have witnessed something incredible or meaningful is that it expresses your age and your birth year as two separate facts , rather than explaining ( as we all actually know ) that your age is a function of your birth year . you are the age you are because your age is the number of full years that have passed since you were born . <PARA> the “ age + birth year ” canard is an old one . internet users spread an almost identical meme in 2017 :

false	origins : prior to the farce that was the u . s . presidential election of 2000 , few knew what the little bits of paper punched from a ballot were called , and no one much cared . the situation surrounding the balloting in florida changed all that . overnight , the electorate found itself in a world where talk of ‘ chads ’ was all the rage , with the significance of dimpled , hanging , and pregnant ones hotly disputed . an unfamiliar word no one had much noticed was now on everyone ’ s lips , the internet quickly <PARA> picking up the slack with a false history of its etymology when ordinary dictionaries failed to provide much illumination . ‘ chad ’ was fast on its way to becoming the word of the year . <PARA> somewhere in the furor , someone noticed there had once been a catholic saint of this name , and a hasty perusal of the details of his life appeared to link him to a disputed election . this link kicked in the irony afterburners . it didn ’ t take long for statements of “ st . chad would be the perfect patron saint for disputed elections ” to morph into “ st . chad is the patron saint of disputed elections .” <PARA> st . chad isn ’ t the patron saint of disputed elections — no calendar of saints lists him as such , and probably none ever will . the details of his life don ’ t support this association , as much as we , the irony - seekers , would like to find one . <PARA> chad was born in northumbria , probably around a . d . 620 . he and his three brothers became priests , and he studied with his brother , cedd , at lindisfarne under st . aidan . ( these two brothers went on to become two of the earliest native bishops of the english church and were both canonized after their deaths . their mama must have been very proud — she ’ d produced two saints .) <PARA> his career as a bishop began under a cloud due to a botched consecration and a muddle over who had been appointed to serve where , and it is upon these points joking references to him being the “ patron saint of disputed elections ” rest . <PARA> chad served for a time as a priest in ireland but was recalled to run an abbey in yorkshire . he was soon summoned by king oswin to become bishop of york , but oswin ’ s son had already appointed another worthy priest , wilfrid , to that office . wilfrid was out of the country , however , seeking proper consecration from the bishops in gaul . he afterwards chose to remain with them for an additional two years , setting the stage for what was to be an embarrassing situation all around . <PARA> it is likely honest confusion over who had been granted the mandate for the bishopric of york that led to chad ’ s belief he had been appointed to serve there . it is also possible king oswin had concluded wilfrid was dead , thus necessitating his appointment of chad . however it came about , chad left his abbey and took up his duties in york . <PARA> further <PARA> complicating an already contentious situation was chad ’ s <PARA> formal installation as bishop of york : it was botched . those who carried out the ceremony were mavericks still clinging to celtic ways instead of embracing the new unified forms of the church . their consecration of chad was therefore ruled improper because technically those doing the anointing were deemed to be out of communion with the church . even if chad had been appointed to fill an actual vacancy ( as opposed to one already occupied , albeit in absentia , by wilfrid ), he would have had to have been re - consecrated by clerics recognized by rome . <PARA> wilfrid returned to england in 666 . finding chad performing his duties in his place , he retired to the abbey at ripon . <PARA> when st . theodore of tarsus came to england in 669 , one of the first things he did was depose chad and restore wilfrid . chad had not been elected to the post he ’ d usurped , hence any claims his “ resignation ” stemmed from his stepping aside after a disputed election are fatuous . ( his resignation was of the face - saving sort seen so often these days in the world of business — he hadn ’ t a lot of choice in the matter , although he did craft a masterful letter to st . theodore : “ if you know i have not duly received episcopal ordination , i willingly resign the office , for i never thought myself worthy of it ,” wrote chad .) <PARA> st . theodore was not a foolish man , and he clearly recognized chad ’ s holiness and abilities , even if the priest ’ s consecration had been botched , and even though he ’ d had to remove him from a post the man shouldn ’ t have been occupying . now that the northumbrian situation had been laid to rest , theodore quickly rectified the defect in chad ’ s consecration . no longer bishop of york , chad retired to the monastery at lastingham . <PARA> although it has become fashionable in the current “ chad as patron saint of disputed elections ” frenzy to claim theodore was so impressed by chad ’ s humility that he declared the ordination valid and asked the king to appoint him bishop of mercia , in truth it was the king of mercia who set things in motion later in 669 by asking theodore to appoint a bishop for his people . theodore recalled chad from lastingham and appointed him to this new post . chad settled the mercian see at lichfield , and rapidly acquired a reputation for sanctity . he lived there in quiet simplicity until his death three years later from bubonic plague in 672 . <PARA> should chad be recognized as the patron saint of disputed elections anyway ? probably not , but that doesn ’ t mean popular wisdom won ’ t refer to him as such from now on . if anything , though , he should be recognized as the humble and holy man he was . if there ’ s an opening for a patron saint of humility , he gets my vote . <PARA> [ prayer for st . chad ’ s day ( march 2 ), episcopal church ] <PARA> almighty god , for the peace of the church , your servant chad relinquished cheerfully the honors that had been thrust upon him , only to be rewarded with equal responsibility : keep us , we pray , from thinking of ourselves more highly than we ought to think , and ready at all times to step aside for others , that the cause of christ may be advanced . <PARA> almighty god , for the peace of the church , your servant chad relinquished cheerfully the honors that had been thrust upon him , only to be rewarded with equal responsibility : keep us , we pray , from thinking of ourselves more highly than we ought to think , and ready at all times to step aside for others , that the cause of christ may be advanced . <PARA> though the woes of election 2000 served to focus attention on a long - dead priest few would otherwise have heard of , little thought appeared to have been given to wilfrid , although his sacrifice was arguably greater than chad ’ s . remember , wilfrid came back from gaul only to find another priest serving in his duly appointed place . we don ’ t know how he handled this news — whether he made a great fuss , a small fuss , or no fuss at all — but we do know he retired to an abbey , leaving chad to manage the bishopric of york for an additional three years until theodore showed up to set things to rights . if honors are being given out for relinquishing that which didn ’ t belong to the relinquisher in the first place , should there not be even greater honors accorded to the one who stepped back from what he ’ d duly and properly been appointed to ? <PARA> barbara “ honor role ” mikkelson

( the article heavily implied , but didn ’ t actually state , that police found any evidence that she was planning to blow up the pipeline .) <PARA> judicial watch has previously misreported or misrepresented other stories , such as one 2014 claim that isis was entering the united states via mexico , and planning an imminent attack : <PARA> we contacted the luna county sheriff ’ s department to inquire about the rumors , and a representative told us that there was absolutely “ no truth ” to the story : that no such arrests had been made , no such refugees had been apprehended , no such gas pipeline plans had been uncovered in the course of any criminal apprehensions . <PARA> likewise , the u . s . border patrol told us : “ we ’ re just as confused as you are . we heard nothing about it and contacted the luna county sheriff ’ s department to see what they said . the story appears to be completely , one hundred percent fabricated and we have no knowledge of anything like that happening .”
true	tweets by two academics in october 2018 shed light on legislative efforts in north carolina to target non - white voters , as documented by court excerpts they shared which were distributed widely online . <PARA> on 15 october 2018 , sarah damaske , an associate professor of labor and employment relations at penn state university , shared a tweet from university of chicago professor harold pollak linking to a federal court decision regarding the state ’ s “ voter id ” law , known as house bill 589 or sl 2013 - 381 : <PARA> the law , which was passed in 2013 , shortened the early voting period from 17 days to ten and eliminated both same - day voter registration and two sunday voting dates which frequently saw african - american churches provide rides for parishioners to the polls . <PARA> while pollak ’ s original tweet posted a day earlier , had been shared more than 9 , 000 times damaske ’ s amplification of it had been retweeted nearly 23 , 000 times within a week after her posting of it . <PARA> “ i think people picked it up , because there is a lot of concern about the many stories about voter suppression along racial lines in this election cycle ( even though the story that dr . pollack tweeted about and that i re - tweeted was from an earlier voting cycle ),” damaske said of the re - circulated tweet . <PARA> the legal excerpt cited in the tweet was taken from a 29 july 2016 decision by the the u . s . court of appeals for the 4th circuit which struck down the voter id law : <PARA> the decision overturned a district court ruling upholding the state voter id law . writing for the 4th circuit , judge diana gribbon called the prior decision “ erroneous ”: <PARA> according to gribbon , the 4th circuit court concluded “ that the general assembly would not have eliminated same - day registration entirely but for its disproportionate impact on african americans ,” and said that parts of the law amounted to solutions in search of a problem : <PARA> in may 2017 , the u . s . supreme court opted not to hear an appeal of the lower court ’ s ruling :
false	on 17 february 2016 , the dubious web site now8news published an article claiming that police in los angeles had discovered a dozen female bodies in freezers in a private residence and that the corpses all had “ black lives matter ” carved into their skin : <PARA> nothing about this story was true . it originated solely with now8news , a fake news site that traffics in fabricated , sensationalized stories and clickbait headlines . on 18 february 2016 , this story was copied by empire herald , another fake news site , ( where the number of putatively discovered bodies was increased from a dozen to 19 ). <PARA> now8news used old photographs that had nothing to do with their fake story to illustrate their article . empire herald also used photographs from older , unrelated news stories in their version . neither now8news nor empire herald carried disclaimers warning readers that their news articles are entirely fictional .
unproven	in 1998 , three members of the 1980s punk band dead kennedys sued their former frontman , jello biafra . those three members — east bay ray , klaus fluoride , and d . h . peligro — sued biafra to recover unpaid royalties as well as to maintain rights over the band ’ s musical catalog . the case was acrimonious and both sides tell different stories about what ultimately lead to the breakdown in the former band members ’ relationship . <PARA> the bulk of the case alleged that biafra , in his capacity as the owner of the record label that distributed the dead kennedys ’ music , owed the rest of the band royalties from the sales of those albums . two entities were involved : decay music , a publishing company which was formed in 1981 by the four members of the dead kennedys as an equal partnership ; and alternative tentacles records , a record label was founded by ray , biafra , and another man in 1979 . the dead kennedys released their first single ( california über alles ) on alternative tentacles in the united states , but after that it was a label used for non - dead kennedy projects . <PARA> in 1984 , decay music ( which comprised all four members of the dead kennedys ) gave the rights to distribute dead kennedy music to alternative tentacles records ( which , by 1987 , included only biafra as an owner ). the 1998 suit alleged two major failings on the part of biafra : that as director of alternative tentacles he underpaid the other band members by raising the retail price of the records without increasing the royalty calculation , and that he failed to properly advertise or promote the band ’ s old catalog , leading the other members of the band to receive less revenue than they should have if alternative tentacles had been run properly . <PARA> a february 2000 article in spin describes a lack of formal legal agreements that made the case challenging to handicap at the time : <PARA> in 2003 , after a jury trial and an appeal , biafra lost the case and was forced to pay $ 220 , 000 to his former bandmates — both for unpaid royalties and for fraud . in 2004 , biafra dropped a countersuit against the remaining members ( who now tour without him ), giving the rights to the dead kennedys ’ former catalog to decay music . <PARA> in interviews from during and after the trial , biafra alleged that this dispute was not about the money itself ( he says the royalty issue was an accounting error that they were working to resolve before the case even began ), and he instead framed the issue as an objection to his former band members “ selling out .” <PARA> in a claim repeated many times ( and disputed to this day ), biafra alleges that things soured between the bandmates when biafra vetoed using their song “ holiday in cambodia ” in a levi ’ s commercial : <PARA> “ they ’ re punishing me for sticking to the principles of the band and underground , independent culture ,” biafra argued when he lost the jury trial . in a 2003 rolling stone article , fluoride argued that it was merely about recognizing the equality of decision making over their old catalog : <PARA> the other three dead kennedys have consistently denied that any dispute over licensing a song for a levi ’ s ad played a role in bringing their lawsuit to trial , and have stated their belief that the argument was a “ smokescreen ” to hide the financial fraud committed by biafra . <PARA> unfortunately , neither the court nor the jury were asked to rule on what initially caused the litigants to move to trial , and we were not there when the alleged incident happened . as such , we rank the claim that a levi ’ s ad dispute precipitated the lawsuit between members of the dead kennedys as unproven .
mixture	on 2 august 2017 , a reddit user shared a photograph of an information flyer regarding rape and sexual assault to the subreddit r / interestingasfuck : <PARA> the poster did not provide a source or context for the image , and appeared to interact on reddit primarily in the form of submissions . the flyer read : <PARA> although the document appears to be a handout from a rape crisis or advocacy center of some description it also looks as if identifying information ( indicating jurisdiction , among other things ) had been cropped out , priming the image to be shared by a larger audience . <PARA> nothing claimed in the flyer was particularly bad or harmful advice , but it also targeted assault victims and made promises that might not always be true , such as that a hospital escort would be available . further , statements about preventive care following an assault are worthy of double - checking , because of the decreased efficacy of such treatments over the course of hours following an assault . <PARA> the meme ’ s first claim is that it is possible to seek medical treatment without reporting the rape or assault to the police , a statement that is gray at best . confidentiality standards maintained by the rape , abuse & incest national network ( rainn ) require sexual assault hotlines to adhere to privacy policies , but we found no sweeping guarantee in the united states that any third party was prohibited from reporting a suspected rape or assault to local authorities . according to the national network to end domestic violence , inc ., in some situations mandated reporters are bound to report suspected assault or rape regardless of the victim ’ s wishes : <PARA> a 2013 question - and - answer piece published by cleveland ’ s plain dealer clarifies : <PARA> in 2014 , canadian broadcast outlet cbc reported that a hospital visit does not automatically trigger police involvement in canada , again stipulating that minors do not have the option of refusing police involvement . the meme also said that evidence can be collected for up to five days and would be held for six months in the event the victim opted to involve police at a later date . this is potentially misleading . according to the national center for victims of crime [ pdf ], the length of time kits are held by law enforcement fluctuates : <PARA> the same organization noted that advances in dna testing enabled evidence collection in some cases for up to 96 hours ( four days ) after an assault . but 12 to 24 hours [ pdf ] is optimal for investigative purposes , and evidence can deteriorate at the upper end of that window : <PARA> in other words , four days is stretching the bounds of forensics , and not all jurisdictions hold samples for up to six months . in addition , advocacy groups routinely advise victims to avoid the following before collecting evidence : <PARA> the meme went on to claim that testing for incapacitating drugs could occur between 24 and 72 hours after an assault , which is complicated by the breadth of substances that fall into that particular category . although rohypnol ( roofies ) and gamma - hydroxybutyrate ( ghb ) are commonly recognized as agents used to incapacitate victims , alcohol and benzodiazepines also are classed as drugs associated with date rape . ghb has a short half - life , but rohypnol can appear in tests for approximately 28 days . the range of drugs used to facilitate non - consensual sexual encounters is broad enough that a specific window of 24 to 72 hours does not fit that wide spectrum . <PARA> next , the flyer says that medications to prevent sexually transmitted disease and pregnancy must be started within 72 hours .” the world health organization ’ s guidance on post - assault care recommends something different : <PARA> when agencies and organizations do recommend prophylactic antibiotics , we found no time limit included . with respect to emergency contraceptives , intra - uterine devices ( iuds ) were considered effective for five days after a rape or unprotected sexual encounter . oral emergency contraceptives ( the “ morning after pill ”) are not typically recommended after 72 hours , and work best when used as soon as possible after exposure to pregnancy risk . <PARA> the final bullet point appears specific to whatever entity originally published the list . the claim that victims can obtain an escort without a number to call or other resource provided is open - ended , and clearly not applicable in all situations . according to rainn , there is a possibility ( but no guarantee ) victims can connect with the support described on the sheet : <PARA> the rape and sexual assault flyer posted to reddit offers a mixture of true , false , and likely region - specific information , running the risk of confusing rape and assault victims in the critical hours after an attack . reference to the upper end of forensic and prophylactic services could lull individuals into a false sense of security , as does the lack of stipulation that minors or other at - risk individuals are often unable to seek medical care without police involvement .
mixture	partway into the 2017 nfl season , the practice begun by san francisco 49ers quarterback colin kaepernick during the previous year ’ s exhibition season — of kneeling on the sidelines ( rather than standing ) during the playing of the u . s . national anthem before games in order to symbolize opposition to racial injustice in america — had become widespread around the league . many players — and some whole teams — had similarly started “ taking a knee ” on the sidelines , or staying in the locker room , while pre - game renditions of “ the star - spangled banner ” were played in football stadiums . <PARA> the protest gained momentum after united states president donald trump issued comments prior to the nfl ’ s week 3 schedule suggesting that football players who declined to stand during the national anthem should be fined , that fans should boycott games , and that the league should alter their policy to force players to stand during pre - game ceremonies : <PARA> during that weekend ’ s games , an item began circulating via social media proclaiming that the nfl league rulebook specifically required that all players must be on the sideline during the playing of the national anthem , and that “ failure to be on the field by the start of the national anthem may result in discipline , such as fines , suspensions , and / or the forfeiture of draft choice ( s )”: <PARA> however , no such wording appears in the 2017 version of the official playing rules of the national football league ( which the nfl also sometimes refers to as an “ operations manual ”): pages 62 and 63 contain only regulations about the enforcement of fouls committed on the field during gameplay , and nowhere else does that document specify anything about the either the playing of the national anthem prior to games or the required behavior of players and team personnel during that ceremony . in fact , the rulebook makes no mention of the national anthem at all . <PARA> rule 4 , which covers game timing , states only that both teams must be on the field before the scheduled start time of the first and second halves , and must initially appear on the field at least 10 minutes early in order to allow sufficient time for warming up : <PARA> rule 5 , which covers players , substitutes , equipment , and general rules , does include ( in article 8 ) a section prohibiting players from “ conveying personal messages ” throughout the game day while they are visible to fans in attendance and television audiences , and from “ convey [ ing ] messages , through helmet decals , arm bands , jersey patches , or other items affixed to game uniforms or equipment , which relate to political activities or causes ...”: <PARA> however , some sources have confusingly stated that the nfl has a separate game operations manual distributed to all the teams , and it is that document , not the rulebook , which supposedly includes the wording in question regarding player conduct during the national anthem : <PARA> we have not yet been able to independently confirm the existence and wording of this second document ( the nfl has not responded to our query ), but the proffered wording — which league spokesman brian mccarthy described as a “ policy ” rather than a “ rule ” — states that players must “ be ” on the sideline for the national anthem , not that they must “ stand ” on the sideline ( the latter is listed only as something players “ should ” do ). the wording also establishes that players “ may ” ( not “ shall ”) be penalized for not observing the regulation , and indeed the nfl announced that they would not take any disciplinary measures over players ’ remaining in the locker room before week 3 games : <PARA> when colin kaepernick first made waves by kneeling during pre - game ceremonies back in august 2016 , the nfl issued a statement proclaiming that “ players are encouraged but not required to stand during the playing of the national anthem .” nbc news similarly observed that “ the nfl has no such rule , and the collective bargaining agreement is silent on the subject .” <PARA> nonetheless , could article 8 , rule 5 of the rulebook itself be interpreted as requiring nfl players to stand on the sidelines during the national anthem ? the latter part of it would not seem to apply , as players who kneel or remain in the locker room during the playing of “ the star - spangled banner ” are not wearing , or affixing to their uniforms , any symbols related to their protest . the first part seemingly provides league officials broad latitude to determine what constitutes a “ personal message ,” but as james dator noted in addressing this issue on sbnation , it ’ s unlikely that section could or would be applied to the current protests :
true	in april 2019 , we started receiving queries about a viral piece of text entitled “ thoughts from a hipster coffee shop ...” supposedly written by a young woman named alyssa ahlgren . the post outlined some thoughts on poverty in the united states , millennials ’ alleged sense of entitlement , and the popularity of socialist policies among her generation . <PARA> the article , which included a photograph of the author , was widely shared on facebook . we also encountered a few chain - email versions sharing this text under titles such as “ one millennialist point of view ” and “ college student : my generation is blind to the prosperity around us ”: <PARA> misattribution is a rampant problem on the internet . one common tactic of those who pass along political tracts is to change the author of the piece to someone who seems better suited to deliver the information , in order to lend credence to the expressed opinions . in march 2018 , for example , the name of relatively unknown mychal massie was removed from an opinion piece that labeled u . s . president donald trump as a pragmatist ( rather than a democrat or republican ) and was replaced with that of well - known political commentator charles krauthammer . <PARA> in ahlgren ’ s case , some readers apparently were skeptical that her opinions were actually expressed by a millennial and therefore questioned whether ahlgren ’ s name and image had been correctly attached to them . <PARA> one email version of the piece we encountered was preceded by the following text : <PARA> the “ thoughts from a hipster coffee shop ...” opinion piece was truly written by ahlgren . the article was originally published on 6 april 2019 on the website alphanewsmn , where ahlgren is a regular contributor . ahlgren has also been published by the daily caller and is an ambassador for the conservative organization turning point usa . <PARA> here ’ s a video of ahlgren discussing “ socialism on the rise ” during an april 2019 appearance on tucker carlson ’ s fox news television show :

false	what a monster ! i made a call to the st . john ’ s county sheriff ’ s office and the lady who answered the phone said it is real and happened about two months ago which would put it in september or october , 2009 . i have heard of eastern diamond backs being killed that were in excess of 8 feet long which is huge but this is almost twice that size . makes you want to not go outside without a powerful flashlight at night . <PARA> variations : variant versions place the capture of the snake shown above in canton , texas , or “ just south of cape town .” <PARA> origins : the photographs displayed above do show an eastern diamondback rattlesnake which was captured in the st . augustine , florida , area in september 2009 . however , as is common with internet - circulated pictures of snakes , the size of the serpent has been greatly exaggerated in the accompanying text . <PARA> eastern diamondback rattlers average about 5 . 5 feet in length , and the very largest specimens of the species might approach 8 feet , so a 15 - foot eastern diamondback would be a truly extraordinary ( and unbelievable ) occurrence . in fact , the apparent size of this rattler has been exaggerated in the photographs due to forced perspective ( i . e ., the snake is much closer to the camera lens than other objects in the frame ), and the diamondback measured only 7 feet , 3 inches — less than half the length claimed above : <PARA> a venomous snake over seven feet long was discovered in a neighborhood over the weekend . <PARA> it was an eastern diamondback rattlesnake that measured 7 feet , 3 inches in length . according to the university of florida , the record size for that type of snake is 8 feet , so this was definitely a large snake . <PARA> homeowner howard mcgaffney saw the snake on the perimeter of his neighborhood , tuscany village , near state road 16 and interstate 95 . <PARA> someone called the sheriff ’ s office and a1 trapper man , a local wildlife trapper , to deal with it . <PARA> it was an eastern diamondback rattlesnake that measured 7 feet , 3 inches in length . according to the university of florida , the record size for that type of snake is 8 feet , so this was definitely a large snake . <PARA> homeowner howard mcgaffney saw the snake on the perimeter of his neighborhood , tuscany village , near state road 16 and interstate 95 . <PARA> someone called the sheriff ’ s office and a1 trapper man , a local wildlife trapper , to deal with it .
true	here ’ s something you probably don ’ t know about albert einstein . in 1946 , the nobel prize - winning physicist traveled to lincoln university in pennsylvania , the alma mater of langston hughes and thurgood marshall and the first school in america to grant college degrees to blacks . at lincoln , einstein gave a speech in which he called racism “ a disease of white people ,” and added , “ i do not intend to be quiet about it .” he also received an honorary degree and gave a lecture on relativity to lincoln students . <PARA> in fact , many significant details are missing from the numerous studies of einstein ’ s life and work , most of them having to do with einstein ’ s opposition to racism and his relationships with african americans . <PARA> einstein continued to support progressive causes through the 1950s , when the pressure of anti - communist witch hunts made it dangerous to do so . another example of einstein using his prestige to help a prominent african american occurred in 1951 , when the 83 - year - old w . e . b . du bois , a founder of the naacp , was indicted by the federal government for failing to <PARA> register as a “ foreign agent ” as a consequence of circulating the pro - soviet stockholm peace petition . einstein offered to appear as a character witness for du bois , which convinced the judge to drop the case . <PARA> in the wake of the monumental effort to digitize einstein ’ s life and genius for the masses , let ’ s hope that more of us will acknowledge <PARA> einstein ’ s greatness as a champion of human and civil rights for african - americans as one of his greatest contributions to the world . <PARA> origins : the e - mail reproduced above is an excerpt from a 2007 harvard university gazette article about a talk given by fred jerome and rodger taylor , authors of the 2006 book einstein on race and racism . as related in that article , jerome and taylor undertook their effort in order to “ recognize and correct many significant details missing from the numerous studies of einstein ’ s life and work , most of them having to do with einstein ’ s opposition to racism and his relationships with african americans : <PARA> nearly fifty years after his death , albert einstein remains one of america ’ s foremost cultural icons . a thicket of materials , ranging from scholarly to popular , have been written , compiled , produced , and published about his life and his teachings . among the ocean of einsteinia — scientific monographs , biographies , anthologies , bibliographies , calendars , postcards , posters , and hollywood films — however , there is a peculiar void when it comes to the connection that the brilliant scientist had with the african american community . virtually nowhere is there any mention of his relationship with paul robeson , despite einstein ’ s close friendship with him , or w . e . b . du bois , despite einstein ’ s support for him . <PARA> this unique book is the first to bring together a wealth of writings by einstein on the topic of race . although his activism in this area is less well known than his efforts on behalf of international peace and scientific cooperation , he spoke out vigorously against racism both in the united states and around the world . <PARA> this unique book is the first to bring together a wealth of writings by einstein on the topic of race . although his activism in this area is less well known than his efforts on behalf of international peace and scientific cooperation , he spoke out vigorously against racism both in the united states and around the world . <PARA> in may 1946 , einstein made a rare public appearance outside of princeton , new jersey ( where he lived and worked in the latter part of his life ), when he traveled to the campus of pennsylvania ’ s lincoln university , the united states ’ first degree - granting black university , to take part in a ceremony conferring upon him the honorary degree of doctor of laws . prior to accepting that degree , he delivered a ten - minute speech to the assembled audience in which he called upon the united states to take a leading role in preventing another world war and denounced the practice of segregation . because mainstream u . s . newspapers reported little or nothing about the event , a full transcript of einstein ’ s speech that day does not exist — the only existing record of his words is a few excerpts pieced together from quotes reproduced in coverage by the black press : <PARA> the only possibility of preventing war is to prevent the possibility of war . international peace can be achieved only if every individual uses all of his power to exert pressure on the united states to see that it takes the leading part in world government . <PARA> the united nations has no power to prevent war , but it can try to avoid another war . the u . n . will be effective only if no one neglects his duty in his private environment . if he does , he is responsible for the death of our children in a future war . <PARA> my trip to this institution was in behalf of a worthwhile cause . there is a separation of colored people from white people in the united states . that separation is not a disease of colored people . it is a disease of white people . i do not intend to be quiet about it . <PARA> the situation of mankind today is like that of a little child who has a sharp knife and plays with it . there is no effective defense against the atomic bomb ... it can not only destroy a city but it can destroy the very earth on which that city stood . <PARA> the united nations has no power to prevent war , but it can try to avoid another war . the u . n . will be effective only if no one neglects his duty in his private environment . if he does , he is responsible for the death of our children in a future war . <PARA> my trip to this institution was in behalf of a worthwhile cause . there is a separation of colored people from white people in the united states . that separation is not a disease of colored people . it is a disease of white people . i do not intend to be quiet about it . <PARA> the situation of mankind today is like that of a little child who has a sharp knife and plays with it . there is no effective defense against the atomic bomb ... it can not only destroy a city but it can destroy the very earth on which that city stood . <PARA> as the authors of einstein on race and racism noted , einstein ’ s comments about segregation at lincoln university reflected his own experiences in both his native germany and his adopted home in the united states and were part of a pattern of his attempting to ameliorate the effects of discrimination : <PARA> according to jerome and taylor , einstein ’ s statements at lincoln were by no means an isolated case . einstein , who was jewish , was sensitized to racism by the years of nazi - inspired threats and harassment he suffered during his tenure at the university of berlin . einstein was in the united states when the nazis came to power in 1933 , and , fearful that a return to germany would place him in mortal danger , he decided to stay , accepting a position at the recently founded institute for advanced study in princeton , n . j . he became an american citizen in 1940 . <PARA> but while einstein may have been grateful to have found a safe haven , his gratitude did not prevent him from criticizing the ethical shortcomings of his new home . <PARA> “ einstein realized that african americans in princeton were treated like jews in germany ,” said taylor . “ the town was strictly segregated . there was no high school that blacks could go to until the 1940s .” <PARA> einstein ’ s response to the racism and segregation he found in princeton ( paul robeson , who was born in princeton , called it “ the northernmost town in the south ”) was to cultivate relationships in the town ’ s african - american community . jerome and taylor interviewed <PARA> members of that community who still remember the white - haired , disheveled figure of einstein strolling through their streets , stopping to chat with the inhabitants , and handing out candy to local children . <PARA> one woman remembered that einstein paid the college tuition of a young man from the community . another said that he invited marian anderson to stay at his home when the singer was refused a room at the nassau inn . <PARA> but while einstein may have been grateful to have found a safe haven , his gratitude did not prevent him from criticizing the ethical shortcomings of his new home . <PARA> “ einstein realized that african americans in princeton were treated like jews in germany ,” said taylor . “ the town was strictly segregated . there was no high school that blacks could go to until the 1940s .” <PARA> einstein ’ s response to the racism and segregation he found in princeton ( paul robeson , who was born in princeton , called it “ the northernmost town in the south ”) was to cultivate relationships in the town ’ s african -

unproven	there was very little wrong with the motorbike — it had just run out of petrol . although the driver had a spare can of fuel , unfortunately , the petrol cap had frozen stuck . being a resourceful chap ( and brave ), the van driver unbuttoned his fly and peed over the cap to thaw it out . he refilled the tank and the bike rider , still wrapped up against the cold , mumbled a thank you and they both went their separate ways . <PARA> some days later the van driver was called into the office at work and the boss showed him a letter he had received from a local vicar . it praised his helpfulness and expressed gratitude for the assistance he had given the vicar ’ s daughter when she had broken down . 1 <PARA> origins : no one recalls hearing this tale prior to 1984 or thereabouts , but within a couple of years it was being related as a local occurrence both in england and alberta , <PARA> canada . <PARA> locks ( and possibly gas caps ) do freeze in canada , but to get down to those temperatures would mean undriveable road conditions for a motorcycle . at least in southeast ontario , motorcycles are put into storage around the end of october , with a few ( fool ) hardy souls keeping theirs on the road until middle or late november . those bikes don ’ t come out of storage until mid - march at the earliest . it ’ s not the cold that makes winter bus riders out of summer easy riders ; it ’ s the impossibility of maintaining control of the beastie on snow and ice . every turn , every stop , is a potential accident , and it only takes one little mishap to seriously injure the rider and cause hundreds of dollars of damage to the vehicle . one look at a great big bus coming your way and the thought of helplessly skidding under it is enough motivation to hang up the leathers for yet another season . <PARA> what makes this legend work is the mental picture of the van driver ’ s unzipping himself and letting go on the girl ’ s bike without being aware he was manhandling his willy in front of a lady . that the driver later discovers the girl is a vicar ’ s daughter only adds to the embarrassment . <PARA> though men of the cloth and urine would seem unlikely elements to find in the same story , at least one other legend puts them together : <PARA> a friend of a friend , who was a venerable old cleric , was driving through the summery yorkshire dales when his car sputtered and conked <PARA> out . <PARA> the padre was distraught ;

true	origins : although our mores regarding the display of the human body and bodily functions have changed a good deal over the years ( for example , the notion that a woman might breast - feed her child in a public place was almost completely unthinkable just a few decades ago ), most of us still hold very strong taboos against anyone other than intimates seeing us in certain circumstances , such as when we ’ re unclothed , when we ’ re engaged in execretory activities , and <PARA> when we ’ re engaged in sexual activities . our squeamishness in these regards is such that we ’ re often quite uncomfortable when others are present during these circumstances , even if they cannot see us . ( many people feel quite embarrassed about disrobing when a member of the opposite sex is present in the room , even if that other person keeps his or her eyes tightly closed .) on the other hand , we may not be so fussy about stripping down in a locker room or using a public bathroom in the presence of others — it somehow seems more acceptable for us to do these things in front of other people when those others are engaged in the same activity . <PARA> the concept of how we react to “ seeing but not being seen ” was put to the test by 38 - year - old architectural artist monica bonvicini in december 2003 , when her work entitled “ don ’ t miss a sec ” was installed at a construction site ( the future home of the chelsea college of art and design ) across the road from london ’ s tate britain museum . ( that same work was also displayed at an art exhibition in basel , switzerland , in june 2004 .) bonvicini ’ s creation was a public toilet enclosed within reflective glass walls that allowed the user to see out but prevented those outside from seeing in , an exhibit that challenged whether we can adapt to the idea of being able to view others passing in close proximity to us while we engage in an activity which we don ’ t want them to view — even when we know full well that they can ’ t possibly see us . as a spokesman for ms . bonvicini explained : <PARA> it will arouse curiosity because people can come and just use it , although there is a question of whether people will feel comfortable doing so . <PARA> they may be wary of desecrating a work of art or may be uneasy that because they can see out , other people can see in . <PARA> there could be this feeling that there is some form of switch to change it and let people see in , but of course there isn ’ t . <PARA> they may be wary of desecrating a work of art or may be uneasy that because they can see out , other people can see in . <PARA> there could be this feeling that there is some form of switch to change it and let people see in , but of course there isn ’ t . <PARA> jeff boloten , who worked at the tate britain , noted : <PARA> playing with the idea of the most private bodily function and having to sit on a street corner is just bizarre . <PARA> the construction site makes it interesting because portable toilets are at construction sites all the time , but , the tate britain ’ s a respected institution ; the juxtaposition makes it more unique . <PARA> the construction site makes it interesting because portable toilets are at construction sites all the time , but , the tate britain ’ s a respected institution ; the juxtaposition makes it more unique . <PARA> the title of the work referred to ms . bonvicini ’ s observation that attendees at art openings were afraid to leave the room for fear of missing a key entrance or comment , hence her “ don ’ t miss a sec ” exhibit “ reflects peoples ’ reluctance to leave the spectacle , and allows the art - goer to remain in the action , even while on the toilet .” her use of a stainless steel toilet and sink unit was inspired by the fact that the “ don ’ t miss a sec ” exhibition site once housed millbank penitentiary , a 19th century prison facility .
unproven	one of the perennial favorites in the “ bad marketing examples ” sweepstakes is the tale of the mythical baby food company that failed to consider cultural differences and thereby ended up repulsing consumers in a foreign market . in this case the horrified victims are africans , who , used to judging the contents of packaged food products by the pictures on their labels , are aghast to find jars with drawings of babies on them . <PARA> examples : <PARA> perhaps this tale is so popular because it enables us to feel smugly superior to both the should - have - known - better multinational corporation , and the foreign rubes who don ’ t understand what a jar of baby food is . note that the examples offered are marvels of non - specificity . no company is mentioned by name in the first two , but by the third a standard law of urban folklore has kicked in and the largest and most well - known purveyor of baby food in america ( gerber ) is now identified as the perpetrator . more important , all three examples cite no locale more specific than “ africa ,” as if the entire continent — from tunisia to south africa , from senegal to somalia — were home to a homogeneous mass of people , all of whom share a single culture and therefore all think and act alike . no doubt we ’ re supposed to conjure up the old stereotypical images of a mysterious land chock full of dark - skinned , scantily - clad , masked savages with bones through their noses who dance rings around large iron pots of missionary soup in time to the beat of tribal drums . where else in the world but africa would one find so many illiterate people ? and ho - ho , isn ’ t it funny to think of those cannibalistic primitives as actually being shocked at the thought of someone else ’ s eating ground - up humans ? what irony ! <PARA> this tale is cultural prejudice at its worst ; an apocryphal anecdote based on the premise of a whole society of illiterates who don ’ t know what baby food is are credulous enough to believe that someone would sell ground - up babies as food . none of the stores selling this stuff think to correct their misperceptions , of course , nor are we apparently supposed to consider that in regions where “ most people can ’ t read ,” “ most people ” also don ’ t generally have enough disposable income to be buying individual jars of prepared baby food in the first place . <PARA> the coup de grace in debunking improbable tales is to find other ( preferably earlier ) examples and variants of the same type of story , but with differing details . in this case , we have hit the mother lode . consider the following tidbit from a 1958 reader ’ s digest : <PARA> hmm . . . seems this story has not only been around the block before ; it ’ s been circling for more than forty years now . this time the setting is new guinea rather than africa , the bemused “ victims ” merely see tins of baby food brought by foreigners rather than encountering them in their local stores ( having cleverly figured out the relationship between label and contents all by themselves ), and to make sure we don ’ t miss the obvious joke , we ’ re told straight out that the shocked natives are cannibals and the foreigners are missionaries ! that ’ s turning the tables , eh ? irony is so much funnier when you dispense with all that subtlety stuff , isn ’ t it ? <PARA> but that ’ s not all — the same motif turns up again , this time with the onus of misunderstanding resting square on the shoulders of the “ dumb foreigners ” or illiterate adults right here in america : <PARA> improbable as they may be , tales about the misconceptions of recent immigrants from other lands and cultures make some sense , but they don ’ t hold up when applied to non - foreign illiterates ( as in the last example above ). those who can ’ t read may miss out on a great deal , but they don ’ t grow up completely ignorant of the conventions of the societies in which they live . even the illiterate know from experience that a red traffic light means “ stop ” ( whether they drive or not ), that a bottle with a skull and crossbones on its label contains something poisonous , and that fried chicken is not something one purchases in a can . or are we supposed to believe that they also pick up cartons bearing pictures of cows from the dairy aisle , expecting to find not milk inside , but roast beef ?

mixture	on 20 february 2016 , presidential candidate hillary clinton was declared the winner of nevada ’ s democratic caucuses , edging rival vermont senator bernie sanders out in what was a contentious night on many levels . <PARA> social media remained a major source for election updates among followers of politics , and many twitter users in particular were hampered by that platform ’ s 140 - character limit ( which sometimes led to misleading or incomplete information , particularly when a link was tweeted ). on 2 april 2016 sanders supporters began tweeting that the senator from vermont had actually “ won nevada ” more than a month after the state was called for clinton . much of the nuance of whatever had happened was elided due to character constraints : <PARA> however , as of 9 april 2016 , sites that track delegate counts weren ’ t reflecting any retroactive win in nevada for bernie sanders : <PARA> in fact , the referenced scenario didn ’ t actually encompass sanders ’ having “ flipped ” nevada to retroactively claim a win after having run second to hillary clinton there in february 2016 . as explained by the las vegas sun , the events that led many to believe sanders had actually won nevada involved the second part of a three - step process , in which county conventions select delegates to send to the democratic state convention in may 2016 , not to the democratic national convention in july 2016 ( although , confusingly , some of the former could be among the latter ): <PARA> what all that means , in short , is that sanders will have a larger number of delegates ( 2 , 124 ) attending the state convention in may than clinton will ( 1 , 722 ), and thus he may be able to “ flip ” a few of those remaining 12 convention delegates . but most likely all that will happen is that sanders will go from an estimated 20 - 15 deficit to a more narrow 18 - 17 delegate split , which is not a “ win ” for him . the washington post echoed that thought , describing sanders ’ gains as preliminary and likely insufficient to give sanders a win in nevada : <PARA> reno television station krnv noted that hillary clinton was at a disadvantage because many of her delegates failed to appear at the clark county democratic convention , something that had happened in 2008 as well : <PARA> in short , sanders did gather more support in nevada at the second - tier clark county convention on 2 april 2016 , and most predictions hold that the events of that day will likely apportion two more delegates to sanders . however , the county convention did not nullify the outcome of the 20 february 2016 caucus , and while sanders did improve his campaign ’ s standing in nevada , he didn ’ t “ flip ” nevada in his favor , as nevada ’ s final “ delegate math ” won ’ t be decided until the state convention on 14 may 2016 .
unproven	while we were all sweating out pages and pages of answers , a friend of mine simply wrote “ i choose number two ”, and did nothing for the rest of the exam . since he had , technically , fulfilled the requirements of the paper , he had to be given full marks . <PARA> almost all gcses i ’ ve seen since then have the instruction “ choose and complete one of the following ”. <PARA> origins : college lore is replete with “ wish fulfillment ” legends such as this one , in which clever students one - up their instructors and achieve high marks on exams not through their superior knowledge of the subject matter , but by taking advantage of semantic ambiguities in the instructions given to them . ( see the “ carry ” grant and barometer problem legends for some examples .) we ’ re not only supposed to admire the student in this legend for his cleverness , but for his temerity as well — how many of us have the guts to risk failing an exam in order to prove a point by pulling a stunt like this ? <PARA> the “ since he had , technically , fulfilled the requirements of the paper , he had to be <PARA> given full marks ” claim is , of course , nothing more than a common exam fantasy . if a professor were really bound by the literalness of his instructions ( even when his intent was clearly something different ), then the “ correction ” offered in the example above would have been of little avail . “ choose and complete one of the following ” indicates that the student must do something more than simply make a selection , but it still doesn ’ t specify exactly what the student must do — it doesn ’ t instruct the student to provide a correct answer , a good answer , or even a logical answer ; it simply requires him to “ complete ” a section . the student who scrawled several paragraphs of nonsense would therefore also have “ technically , fulfilled the requirements of the paper ” and have to be “ given full marks .” <PARA> variations of this legend type involve students who , when given exam questions beginning with “ can you . . .” ( e . g ., “ can you explain the difference between naturalism and realism ?”), simply respond “ yes ” and receive high grades for their literal truthfulness .
false	as the 2016 presidential elections continued to heat up , the vice presidential candidates began to weigh in their own particular interests and issues . republican vice presidential candidate mike pence spotlighted his views on abortion as part of his platform : <PARA> the indiana governor reiterated his stance during a 4 october 2016 debate with his democratic party counterpart , tim kaine : <PARA> following the debate , pence ’ s critics focused on his support for a measure he signed into law on 24 march 2016 , which purportedly made women liable for the cost of funerals for fetuses they had aborted or miscarried . the accusation quickly became a meme , and permeated reporting about the issue : <PARA> the law , which was passed by the republican - heavy state legislature , does require that aborted or miscarried fetuses be buried or cremated . it also requires that women involved in these cases be given the chance to decide how this is carried out . <PARA> however , it did not require the women involved to be present during — or to pay for — the disposal of the material . instead , that fell to the facility in which the miscarriage or abortion took place : <PARA> there is a section , however , covering instances in which “ the parent or parents ” handle the cost : <PARA> the measure also bans women from donating the material toward medical research . in this respect it is similar to legislature in other states : <PARA> pence said when he signed hea 1337 into law that it would “ ensure the dignified final treatment of the unborn .” however , it was quickly challenged in court by the american civil liberties union and planned parenthood of indiana . on 30 june 2016 , u . s . district judge tanya walton pratt suspended the law a day before it was slated to take effect . <PARA> pratt ’ s ruling means that , despite the efforts of pence and state republicans , indiana women will not be asked whether to they wish to bury or cremate ( rather than donate ) their miscarried or aborted fetuses . even so , had the law not been suspended , parents would not have been forced to hold funerals for abortions or miscarriages — much less at their own expense .
true	origins : currency is subject to printing error , and over the course of time a number of coins and banknotes containing misprints have found their way into circulation . sometimes such misstrikes work to make those particular <PARA> items of specie more valuable than they otherwise would have been ( e . g ., an error on the u . s . quarters honoring wisconsin makes those coins more valuable than those honoring other states ), but sometimes the end result is to slip apparently unusual or disturbing imagery into the pockets of the unsuspecting . <PARA> one case of an unusual image that did not involve a misprint occurred with a series of canadian banknotes . george vi ’ s death in 1952 placed his daughter elizabeth onto the british throne and thus created the need to display a likeness of the new monarch on various monies throughout the british commonwealth . in canada , those new bank notes ( issued in 1954 ) featured portraits of elizabeth ii , and it didn ’ t take long for <PARA> canadians to notice something unusual and even seemingly sinister about the young queen ’ s hair as depicted on their money : a grinning demon appeared to be peering out from behind her ear . <PARA> this series of paper currency came to be known as the “ devil ’ s head ” or “ devil ’ s face ” series , and many people continued to see the prince of darkness in the queen ’ s tresses until 1956 , when the bank of canada ordered bank note companies to modify the existing plates by darkening the highlights in her majesty ’ s hair , so concealing ol ’ scratch from view . <PARA> rumor asserted that the “ demon ” in the portrait was the work of an ira member employed at the bank - note company , but the odd image ’ s presence has never been proved the result of anything beyond coincidence . <PARA> barbara “ bad hair day ” mikkelson

unproven	an article of faith among u . s . conservatives of the cold war era stated that the soviets aimed to destroy america from within by promoting a program of “ creeping socialism ,” by which they meant the gradual replacement of democratic , free - market institutions with centralized government control . <PARA> never mind that the communists themselves subscribed to a different version of the end of free - market economies , namely marx ’ s theory that capitalism contained the seeds of its own destruction , an end which he argued was inevitable and would culminate in a socialist revolution . <PARA> regardless , conservative icons such as ronald reagan and barry goldwater saw creeping socialism in every piece of progressive legislation that came around the pike , from roosevelt ’ s new deal to medicare to lbj ’ s great society social - welfare programs of the mid - 1960s . <PARA> they further claimed that at least one soviet leader , nikita khrushchev , had explicitly announced the regime ’ s intent to export “ small doses ” of socialism to the u . s . in a statement he allegedly made in 1959 . reagan was fond of quoting this supposed pronouncement in speeches he gave as a crusader for conservative causes before launching his own political career later in the ’ 60s . this instance is from an address he delivered in 1961 : <PARA> variants of this passage also appeared in newspaper opinion columns , letters to the editor , and even political ads portraying democratic party candidates as enemies of freedom . this example is from the muncie , indiana , star press of 5 november 1960 : <PARA> fast - forwarding to some 56 years later , we find the same quote being deployed against democrats of today , only now in the preferred venue of social media : <PARA> the authenticity of the quote was questioned practically from the get - go , however . in 1962 , sen . lee metcalf ( d - montana ) assailed it as “ a fabrication , attributed to the leader of the communist party , ( which ) arouses americans against their elected officials .” <PARA> metcalf told the los angeles times that the quote was being circulated by organizations including the far - right john birch society , which operated a bookstore called poor richard ’ s book shop in hollywood : <PARA> the times reported that the president of coast federal savings & loan , joe crail , claimed responsibility for printing the postcards but admitted he couldn ’ t authenticate the quote and said the campaign had been discontinued for that reason . <PARA> similarly , sen . morris k . udall ( d - arizona ) recruited the library of congress to verify the authenticity of the statement attributed to khrushchev and shared the results in the 10 may 1962 issue of the new republic : <PARA> all that supposedly changed four years later when a witness came forward to claim that khrushchev had uttered those very words in his presence . ezra taft benson , who served two terms as president eisenhower ’ s secretary of agriculture and would later head the church of jesus christ of latter - day saints , said in a 1966 address at brigham young university ( byu ) that khrushchev made the statement during a one - on - one discussion the two had in september 1959 : <PARA> such a meeting did occur , documents show , but benson ’ s 1966 account of their exchange on communism raises more questions than it answers . benson had cited versions of the same quote on more than one occasion prior to 1966 without claiming that khrushchev said it in his presence . <PARA> like ronald reagan routinely did during the same period , benson told audiences that the soviet premier made the remark before , not during , his 1959 visit to the united states . benson presented it as follows in an august 1961 commencement address at byu ( from a report in the provo daily herald , emphasis added ): <PARA> he introduced the quote more or less the same way in a book he wrote the following year ( 1962 ) called the red carpet : socialism — the royal road to communism ( emphasis added ): <PARA> the three different versions of the story don ’ t jibe . did khrushchev utter the remark three weeks before visiting the u . s ., a few months before , or did he utter it during a face - to - face meeting with benson on u . s . soil ? why did benson write in 1962 ( three years after khrushchev ’ s visit ) that the soviet premier was “ reported ” to have said it ? why was there no mention before 1966 of khrushchev ’ s saying it to his face ? <PARA> unfortunately , ezra taft benson died in 1994 , so we can ’ t ask him . nor , as far as we know , has any third - party witness to the alleged exchange ever come forward . far from settling the question of whether khrushchev really vowed to slip americans “ small doses of socialism ,” benson ’ s conflicting stories leave the authenticity of the remark very much in doubt . <PARA> we should also mention , in passing , that u . s . conservatives were sounding alarms about americans being plied with “ small doses of socialism ” long before khrushchev attained the premiership of the soviet union . this is national association of manufacturers president claude a . putnam speaking in april 1950 ( as reported in the times herald of olean , new york ): <PARA> if we ’ ve learned nothing else in the roughly 60 years of its existence , the durability of the khrushchev quote shows that a politically charged statement needn ’ t be authenticated to serve its purpose as a partisan cudgel . as if to prove the point , the quote was tweeted out to 70 , 000 followers as recently as february 2018 by none other than michael reagan , ronald reagan ’ s son :

false	examples : <PARA> origins : the “ john f . kennedy killed the american hat industry ” legend is — like the “ clark gable killed the men ’ s undershirt industry ” legend — an article of faith which has become an accepted “ fact ” through sheer repetition , rarely questioned by those who cite it . normally we ’ d call for someone to produce statistics to demonstrate that men ’ s hat sales really declined sharply just after kennedy ’ s inauguration , and to demonstrate that kennedy was not merely one of millions of american men following a trend that had actually begun before his inauguration . in this case that call isn ’ t necessary , however , because the premise is flawed : kennedy wasn ’ t hatless at his inauguration , and we have to wonder whether all the journalists who attended the ceremony and now claim he was bare - headed were paying attention . kennedy wore the traditional silk topper all throughout his inaugural day , and the evidence that he did so isn ’ t hard to find . <PARA> according to the washington post ‘ s contemporary coverage of the 1961 inaugural ceremonies , president - elect kennedy was wearing a hat as he made the trip to the white house to meet with president eisenhower prior to his swearing - in : <PARA> it was 10 : 55 when the kennedys left their home at 3307 n . st . nw for their drive to the white house . the soon - to - be president now had on his high silk hat and cutaway and his wife wore a beige suit and pillbox beige hat . <PARA> when kennedy left the white house for the trip to capitol hill with outgoing president eisenhower , both men clearly had top hats atop their heads : <PARA> both men were still hatted as they arrived at the capitol building and made their way to the east portico : <PARA> once again according to the washington post ‘ s coverage , kennedy was wearing his hat as he arrived at the inaugural stand on the east portico of the u . s . capitol : <PARA> it was 12 : 20 p . m . before the president - elect arrived on the inaugural stand for a ceremony that was supposed to start at noon . his wife and mrs . eisenhower , mrs . nixon and mrs . johnson had taken their front - row seats seven minutes earlier . <PARA> president eisenhower had moved onto the scene at 12 : 09 as the united states marine band played “ hail to the chief ,” a piece he was hearing for the last time in his own honor . <PARA> when the outgoing president and his successor were finally seated alongside each other , they doffed their silk hats and began an animated conversation . <PARA> president eisenhower had moved onto the scene at 12 : 09 as the united states marine band played “ hail to the chief ,” a piece he was hearing for the last time in his own honor . <PARA> when the outgoing president and his successor were finally seated alongside each other , they doffed their silk hats and began an animated conversation . <PARA> the silk hat kennedy had just doffed is visible on the empty seat behind him as he delivers his inaugural address : <PARA> as the newly sworn - in 35th president of the united states arrives to take his place next to vice - president johnson on the reviewing stand for the inaugural parade , he ’ s once again wearing his top hat : <PARA> the new president ’ s head is still covered later that evening as he attends an inaugural ball at the armory : <PARA> in fact , kennedy actually revived an inaugural hat - wearing tradition . president harry s truman and vice - president alben barkley both donned the usual silk toppers for truman ’ s inauguration in 1949 : <PARA> but truman ’ s successor , dwight d . eisenhower , who frequently went hatless throughout his eight years in office , wore a homburg rather than top hat to his 1953 inauguration , and even that was little - seen by the crowds in washington that day , according to the washington post : <PARA> mr . truman made another friendly gesture toward his successor . he followed the other ’ s lead , and instead of wearing the silk topper ordained by tradition he wore a black homburg . <PARA> actually , the crowds along the avenue saw little or nothing of the homburgs as the two men rode toward the capitol , followed by mrs . truman , mrs . eisenhower and miss truman . they rode bareheaded , chatted amiably and waved to the crowds . <PARA> actually , the crowds along the avenue saw little or nothing of the homburgs as the two men rode toward the capitol , followed by mrs . truman , mrs . eisenhower and miss truman . they rode bareheaded , chatted amiably and waved to the crowds . <PARA> it is true that kennedy almost never wore a hat after becoming president , but his hatlessness was much more likely the continuation of a trend that had long since begun , not its origin . either way , the common claim that the shunning of hats by american men began because kennedy declined to wear one to his inauguration is flat - out wrong .
false	on 22 november 2015 , the facebook page new yorkers posted a photograph purportedly showing a 41 - lb rat caught in new york city : <PARA> although image was widely shared by various online outlets , no one provided any substantive information about the allegedly enormous rodent . <PARA> if the pictured rat were truly was “ caught ” in new york city , it would most likely have been a brown rat ( also known as a norway or norwegian rat ). the city is home to approximately two million brown rats , according to a 2014 study , but these rodents only grow to about 20 inches in length and 2 lbs . in weight . <PARA> as many commenters pointed out on in responding to the original facebook post , the pictured animal doesn ’ t look like it was “ caught ” at all . the rat appears to be groomed and cleaned and was most likely someone ’ s pet . if that ’ s the case , this animal is probably a gambian pouch rat . while these rodents are a fair bit larger than the brown rat , they don ’ t typically grow any bigger than four pounds . <PARA> so why does the rat pictured above appear so massive ? it ’ s likely the result of forced perspective . the person is holding the rat ( whose hands cannot be seen ) is probably using a pole to place the animal closer to the camera . this technique creates the illusion that what is likely just an average - sized rat appears to be much larger in the photograph . <PARA> for comparison ’ s sake , here ’ s a photograph of a 3 - foot gambian pouch rat that was caught in new york in 2012 :
false	origins : this is a case where a photograph of a remarkable object is real enough , but someone has mistakenly placed the subject nearly half a world away from its true location . <PARA> the structure pictured above is genuine , but it ’ s nowhere near scandinavia . it is actually the monitor - merrimac memorial bridge - tunnel ( mmmbt ), a 4 . 6 - mile long combination bridge - tunnel system ( named for the two ironclad ships that fought in the hampton roads harbor during the civil war ) connecting two virginia communities across the mouth of the james river . <PARA> the mmmbt opened in april 1992 after seven years of construction and a total cost of about $ 400 million . ( fabricating the tunnel portion of the bridge and lowering it into place cost $ 126 million alone .) as described on scott m . kozel ’ s informative highway and transportation history web site ( the source of the aerial photograph displayed above ): <PARA> the tunnel is 4 , 800 feet long from portal to portal , and it was built by the immersed sunken tube method , comprised of 15 prefabricated segments each 300 feet long and with two 2 - lane bores , placed by lay - barges and joined together in a trench dredged in the bottom of the harbor , and backfilled over with earth . four percent ( 4 %) maximum grades are utilized in the tunnel , and a 60 mph design speed . the traffic lanes in the tunnel are 13 feet wide , with 2 . 5 - foot - wide ledges on either side of the roadway , and with 16 . 5 feet of vertical clearance from the roadway to the ceiling . the current shipping channel above the deepest part of the tunnel has 800 feet of horizontal width and 45 feet of vertical depth below the average low - tide water level , and the tunnel was designed and built deep enough to allow for a future enlargement of the shipping channel to 1 , 000 feet of horizontal width and 55 feet of vertical depth below the average low - tide water level . <PARA> according to the virginia department of transportation ( vdot ), the mmmbt incorporates many technological features to provide motorists with a safe and smooth driving experience , including : <PARA> traffic flow is monitored from a traffic management center where employees keep an eye on operations through 33 closed - circuit television cameras . incidents can be detected immediately and assistance dispatched from two emergency response garages . <PARA> seventy - two sensors in the pavement of the tunnel and approach bridges automatically check every 20 seconds for interruptions in traffic flow . in the event of an incident , motorists are advised of alternate routes via 32 electronic message signs activated immediately from the traffic management center . <PARA> while traveling through the monitor merrimac , motorists do not lose their favorite local radio station while in the tunnel . a communications system rebroadcasts all local am and fm radio stations . in the event of an emergency , tunnel staff can override these broadcasts with emergency information motorists receive through their vehicle ’ s radio without changing stations . <PARA> the øresund link , a somewhat similar bridge - tunnel system between sweden and denmark , opened in 2000 , and evidently someone mistook a photograph of one for the other .

false	in april 2019 , a legislative proposal in the state of texas garnered nationwide attention , including in the form of a widely - shared meme posted by the “ other 98 %” facebook page , which proclaimed that “ texas is considering the death penalty for women who have an abortion . they are now so ‘ pro - life ’ they want to kill you ”: <PARA> it is true that in the first few months of 2019 , members of the texas house of representatives considered and debated a bill which would have redefined a “ living child ” to include fertilized eggs , and had the effect of completely outlawing abortion by amending state law on assault and homicide . <PARA> in texas , it is punishable by death to murder a child aged under 10 years , and since the proposed legislation would have reconstituted abortion as the murder of a living child , it is therefore true to say texas lawmakers did indeed debate and consider a bill which would have had the effect of making abortions punishable by death . <PARA> however , the bill ’ s passage through the texas legislature appeared to have come to an abrupt end on 10 april 2019 , shortly after the “ other 98 %” published the meme , when a republican committee chairman announced he would not allow the bill to advance beyond the committee . <PARA> republican house member tony tinderholt introduced house bill 896 ( h . b . 896 ) on 17 january , with his republican house colleagues mike lang and valoree swanson joining as co - authors of the bill , on 26 february . on 25 february , the bill was referred to the house committee on judiciary and civil jurisprudence . <PARA> on 10 april , that committee ’ s chairman , republican house member jeff leach , announced that h . b . 896 would not advance out of the committee , a move which effectively killed the bill : <PARA> the legislation proposed making several changes to existing texas law , with the intention of redefining a “ living child ” to include a fertilized egg and completely outlawing abortion in the state of texas . <PARA> criminal homicide and assault <PARA> chapter 19 of the texas penal code sets out the state ’ s law on criminal homicide , defining and outlining the punishments for murder , manslaughter , criminally negligent homicide , and so on . <PARA> sec . 19 . 06 of that code creates an exception for abortion , stating that the law on criminal homicide does not apply where the death of an unborn child is brought about by the child ’ s mother , or by a licensed physician as part of a medical procedure . however , h . b . 896 would have explicitly reversed this exception , asserting that the law on criminal homicide “ applies to the death of an unborn child regardless of whether the conduct charged ” was committed by a mother or took place as part of a medical procedure . <PARA> sec . 19 . 03 of the penal code states that where an attacker “ murders an individual under 10 years of age ,” that murder is a “ capital felony ,” punishable by execution . <PARA> by removing the sec . 19 . 06 exception for abortions , h . b . 896 would therefore have had the effect of designating abortion an act of criminal homicide against a child under 10 years of age , effectively introducing the death penalty as a punishment for abortion . in this respect , the “ other 98 %” meme and related news reports were accurate . <PARA> chapter 22 of the texas penal code sets out the state ’ s law on assault . sec . 22 . 12 contains an abortion exception to the prohibition on assault which is almost identical to the one found in sec . 19 . 06 of the chapter on criminal homicide . however , h . b . 896 also would have reversed that exception , stating that the ban on assault “ applies to conduct charged as having been committed against an individual who is an unborn child , regardless of whether the conduct ” was committed by the mother of the unborn child , or was part of a medical procedure . <PARA> notably , h . b . 896 appeared to invite a court challenge against it , stating explicitly that “ any federal law , executive order , or court decision that purports to supersede , stay , or overrule this act is in violation of the texas constitution and the united states constitution and is therefore void .” <PARA> the bill also directed the state ’ s attorney general to ensure the assault and criminal homicide prohibitions on abortion were being enforced by state agencies “ regardless of any contrary federal law , executive order , or court decision .” <PARA> the u . s . supreme court ’ s landmark 1973 decision in roe v . wade ruled that a woman ’ s right to access an abortion was protected under her constitutionally - enshrined right to privacy . that decision has been the basis for decades of abortion liberalization , but pro - life activists have long sought to force the nation ’ s highest court to revisit it . <PARA> as the new york times reported , h . b . 896 ’ s attempted outright ban on abortion could be viewed as forming part of a wider pro -

mixture	on 13 january 2011 , the south carolina state conference of the naacp sponsored “ king day at the dome ,” an observance of martin luther king , jr . day held on the grounds of the state capitol in columbia . <PARA> photographs of the event show a state house statue of george washington shielded from view by a structure extending around the front and sides of the statue , a phenomenon which led to claims that the naacp had deliberately chosen to shield the statue of the first u . s . president from view “ so that participants would not be offended by his presence ” ( because the labor at washington ’ s mount vernon estate was largely provided by slaves ): <PARA> the structure around the statue was of a type that the naacp had been using at such rallies for the previous several years , and south carolina naacp executive director dwight james maintained that its purpose was not to obscure the statue from view , as he explained to south carolina news outlet the state : <PARA> photos from the event showed a three - sided box with washington ’ s statue visible only from behind the stage . “ what we had constructed was a background with a graphic to be placed on it ,” james said . “ we weren ’ t trying to obstruct anything .” <PARA> king day organizers have built similar structures around the statue dating back at least to 2007 , according to the state newspaper ’ s archives . <PARA> joanne jones , vice chairwoman of the charleston tea party board , said she assumes the naacp was not intentionally disrespecting a founding father . she said the decision was just “ surprising ,” considering how image - conscious the group is . “ i would have thought they would have thought it through ,” she said . “ they must not have had any alternative .”

mixture	in january 2016 , a meme criticizing democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders for only paying his “ staff interns ” $ 12 an hour while simultaneously campaigning to raise the national minimum wage of $ 15 an hour began circulating online . the meme attempted to paint sanders as a hypocrite , accusing the senator of giving himself a “ pass ” on his proposed policy : <PARA> an increase in the national minimum wage has indeed been one of sanders ’ main campaign issues during the 2016 election : <PARA> it ’ s true sanders pays his interns $ 12 an hour , as noted by a page on the candidate ’ s own senate web site that clearly states that “ interns are paid $ 12 per hour .” this , however , does not necessarily mean that sanders gave himself a “ pass ” on his proposal to raise the minimum wage . <PARA> first , the above - displayed meme uses the confusing term “ staff interns ,” which has led many people to believe that the senator only pays his staff members $ 12 per hour . this pay rate , however , applies only interns ( who in many occupational fields work without compensation or for very low pay in return for gaining valuable experience ) filling positions available to college students and recent graduates seeking work in congress : <PARA> second , the national minimum wage does not apply to internships . the fair labor standards act lists six criteria ( such as “ the internship experience is for the benefit of the intern ”) that private sector companies may meet in order to offer unpaid internships , and congress has further exempted itself from some of these standards . according to an article published in the atlantic , only one third of u . s . senators paid their interns anything at all in 2013 . <PARA> it should also be noted that these $ 12 per hour internships are for positions working as aides to sanders in the u . s . senate , not for positions on his 2016 presidential campaign staff .
false	announcement <PARA> the english are feeling the pinch in relation to recent terrorist threats and have therefore raised their security level from “ miffed ” to “ peeved .” <PARA> soon , though , security levels may be raised yet again to “ irritated ” or even “ a bit cross .” the english have not been “ a bit cross ” since the blitz in 1940 when tea supplies nearly ran out . terrorists have been re - categorized from “ tiresome ” to “ a bloody nuisance .” the last time the british issued a “ bloody nuisance ” warning level was in 1588 , when threatened by the spanish armada . <PARA> the scots have raised their threat level from “ pissed off ” to “ let ’ s get the bastards .” they don ’ t have any other levels . this is the reason they have been used on the front line of the british army for the last 300 years . <PARA> the french government announced yesterday that it has raised its terror alert level from “ run ” to “ hide .” the only two higher levels in france are “ collaborate ” and “ surrender .” the rise was precipitated by a recent fire that destroyed france ’ s white flag factory , effectively paralyzing the country ’ s military capability . <PARA> italy has increased the alert level from “ shout loudly and excitedly ” to “ elaborate military posturing .” two more levels remain : “ ineffective combat operations ” and “ change sides .” <PARA> the germans have increased their alert state from “ disdainful arrogance ” to “ dress in uniform and sing marching songs .” they also have two higher levels : “ invade a neighbor ” and “ lose .” <PARA> belgians ,

emptive strikes , on all of their allies , just in case . <PARA> and in the southern hemisphere ... <PARA> new zealand has also raised its security levels – from “ baaa ” to “ baaaa !”. due to continuing defense cutbacks ( the airforce being a squadron of spotty teenagers flying paper aeroplanes and the navy some toy boats in the prime minister ’ s bath ), new zealand only has one more level of escalation , which is “ i hope australia will come and rescue us ”. <PARA> australia , meanwhile , has raised its security level from “ no worries ” to “ she ’ ll be right , mate ”. three more escalation levels remain : “ crikey !’, “ i think we ’ ll need to cancel the barbie this weekend ” and “ the barbie is cancelled ”. so far no situation has ever warranted use of the final escalation level . <PARA> origins : this spoof of the various systems implemented after the 9 / 11 attacks to warn the public about the possibility of future terrorist activities , melded with stereotypes of several different nationalities , appears to have originated in july 2005 ( just after a series of terrorist bombings hit london ’ s public transport system earlier that month ), with its early forms being a fair bit shorter : <PARA> as london is hit by the second wave of bombings in two weeks , the government has raised the terror warning level from ‘ miffed ’ to ‘ peeved ’. whilst many people commented with respect at the stoical attitude of londoners to the first wave of attacks , londoners are losing their traditional reserve and may soon require the terror level warning to be raised to ‘ irritated ’ or even ‘ a bit cross ’. <PARA> a government spokesmen commented upon the seriousness of the situation . “ london has not been a bit cross since the height of the blitz in 1940 when supplies of tea ran out for almost three weeks ”, said a representative of the security services . “ it is as a mark of the seriousness with which londoners are taking the situation that we have recently been forced to recategorise suicide bombers from ‘ tiresome ’ to ‘ a bloody nuisance ’, and the last time we had a ‘ bloody nuisance ’ warning level was during the great fire of 1666 .” <PARA> on the streets , londoners reacted with uncharacteristic anger to news of the latest attacks , with some members of the public reacting with harsh language to the news that they might be delayed on their homeward trips by up to twenty minutes . <PARA> “ it really is the absolute limit ,” said reginald boggis , 42 , of east ham . “ these terrorists . not content with blowing things

terrorists ? well , that ’ s bloody typical , isn ’ t it ?” <PARA> from there , this item followed a pattern very similar to an earlier satirical piece about the uk ’ s revoking the independence of the united states : what began as a simple bit of humor penned by an anonymous wag and set loose on the internet was <PARA> successively fleshed out and embellished by many different hands , growing longer and longer , until someone erroneously attributed the whole thing to english comic john cleese , a former monty python trouper . and once a famous name gets stuck to a formerly anonymous piece in search of a recognizable author , it virtually never becomes unstuck , so just about every copy of this item circulated over the last several years has borne a legend incorrectly identifying it as “ by john cleese .” ( this false attribution is discussed on john cleese ‘ s official web site .) <PARA> as is typical with such items , it is periodically resurrected and updated to address current events , so versions circulated in mid - 2013 replaced the opening reference to the 2005 london bombings with a mention of “ recent events in syria ” ( i . e ., a civil war taking place in that country ).

true	one of the nation ’ s largest subway systems — the washington metro — has even posted ads warning riders about wearing such shoes on its moving stairways . the ads feature a photo of a crocodile , though they don ’ t mention crocs by name . <PARA> four - year - old rory mcdermott got a croc - clad foot caught in an escalator last month at a mall in northern virginia . his mother managed to yank him free , but the nail on his big toe was almost completely ripped off , <PARA> causing heavy bleeding . <PARA> at first , rory ’ s mother had no idea what caused the boy ’ s foot to get caught . it was only later , when someone at the hospital remarked on rory ’ s shoes , that she began to suspect the crocs and did an internet search . <PARA> “ i came home and typed in ‘ croc ’ and ‘ escalator ,’ and all these stories came up ,” said jodi mcdermott , of vienna , va . “ if i had known , those would never have been worn .” <PARA> according to reports appearing across the united states and as far away as singapore and japan , entrapments occur because of two of the biggest selling points of shoes like crocs : their flexibility and grip . some report the shoes get caught in the “ teeth ” at the bottom or top of the escalator , or in the crack between the steps and the side of the escalator . <PARA> the reports of serious injuries have all involved young children . crocs are commonly worn by children as young as 2 . the company introduced shoes in its smallest size , 4 / 5 , this past spring . <PARA> niwot , colo .- based crocs inc . said it does not keep records of the reasons for customer - service calls . but the company said it is aware of “ very few ” problems relating to accidents involving the shoes , which are made of a soft , synthetic resin . <PARA> “ thankfully , escalator accidents like the one in virginia are rare ,” the company said in a statement . <PARA> in japan , the government warned consumers last week that it has received 39 reports of sandals — mostly crocs or similar products — getting stuck in escalators from late august through early september . most of the reports appear to have involved small children , some as young as two years old . <PARA> kazuo motoya of japan ’ s national institute of technology and evaluation said children may have more escalator accidents in part because they “ bounce around when they stand on escalators , instead of watching where they place their feet .” <PARA> in singapore , a 2 - year - old girl wearing rubber clogs — it ’ s unclear what brand — had her big toe completely ripped off in an escalator accident last year , according to local media reports . <PARA> and at the atlanta airport , a 3 - year - old boy wearing crocs suffered a deep gash across the top of his toes in june . that was one of seven shoe entrapments at the airport since may 1 , and all but two of them involved crocs , said roy springer , operations manager for the company that runs the airport terminal . <PARA> one u . s . retailer that caters to children , mattel subsidiary american girl , has posted signs in three locations directing customers wearing crocs or flip - flop sandals to use elevators instead of escalators . <PARA> during the past two years , so - called “ shoe entrapments ” in the washington subway have gone from being relatively rare to happening four or five times a week in the summer , though none has caused serious injuries , said dave lacosse , who oversees the subway ’ s 588 escalators , the most of any <PARA> u . s . transit system . <PARA> the u . s . consumer product safety commission said escalator accidents caused more than 10 , 000 injuries last year , but the agency has few records of specific shoe problems . only two shoe entrapments have been reported by consumers since the beginning of 2006 . one reported in may involved “ rubber footwear .” <PARA> agency spokesman ed kang urged people who have had problems to report them on the commission ’ s web site . <PARA> crocs officials said they were working with the elevator escalator safety foundation on public education initiatives . but the group ’ s executive director , barbara allen , said that ’ s not true . <PARA> allen said a crocs official called her in september 2006 about possible cooperation , even suggesting the company might put a tag in its shoes with the foundation ’ s web address . but since that first contact , crocs has not called , and nobody from the company will return allen ’ s calls , she said . <PARA> washington metro ’ s lacosse and other escalator experts say the best way to prevent shoe entrapments is to face the direction the stairs are moving , keep feet away from the sides and step over the teeth at the end . <PARA> lacosse , of the washington subway system , said he is personally skittish of crocs and other soft - soled shoes . <PARA> “ would i wear them ? no ,” he said . “ and i tell my children not to wear them either .” <PARA> origins : the preceding example , which began circulating in e - mail in september 2007 , is the text of a 17 september associated press article . crocs , says the article , seems to be the one common theme in recent reports of children getting their feet caught in escalators . <PARA> as more reports of such accidents are noted , it does indeed appear that this particular type of footwear is contributing to instances of escalator entrapment <PARA> ( possibly because the rubbery crenelation of the sole makes these shoes prone to becoming stuck in the tines of escalator steps if wearers stand sideways , or stuck in the space between the stairs and the unit ’ s sidewall if wearers stand otherwise ). the u . s . consumer product safety commission noted in may 2008 that of the 77 escalator entrapment incidents since january 2006 ( of which about half resulted in injury ) all but two of the incidents involved popular soft - sided flexible clogs and slides . “ soft - sided shoes are the most likely to get stuck and pose the possibility of injury to the rider ,” said the cpsc . <PARA> however , such accidents have also befallen those shod in other kinds of footwear . merely swearing off crocs is not the answer : the best way for parents to safeguard their children on escalators is to recognize and minimize the entrapment dangers posed by those devices ( rather than regarding the matter as merely being related to one type of shoe ). <PARA> ann landers has issued warnings about escalator dangers before , but such cautions tend to be forgotten with the passage of time . perhaps this recap of some of the escalator accidents of recent years will help make the cautions more memorable : <PARA> the preceding list is not comprehensive ; it is merely a sampling of the injuries and deaths caused by escalators . the american academy of pediatrics said in 2006 of injuries to children : “ many of the 2 , 000 annual injuries on escalators occur when a shoe , clothing or a stroller becomes trapped in the space between the moving stairs and the side wall .” <PARA> granted , most of those 2 , 000 injuries amounted to mere cuts and bruises , but they include cases of digits crushed or sliced off and of limbs mangled . <PARA> as to what any of us can do to avoid falling victim to the escalators we ride upon : <PARA> in addition to the cautions listed above , here are more tips for those with children : <PARA> barbara “ footwear beware ” mikkelson

( facebook has , however , established a global disaster relief page to help the public find information on legitimate fund - raising organizations .) <PARA> additional messages spread via twitter and facebook state that ups is offering free shipping to haiti for packages of 50 lbs . or less . this is not accurate . although the company is contributing more than $ 1 million in cash and support to earthquake relief efforts in haiti , it is not , as noted in its blog , providing free delivery of parcels to that country : <PARA> on twitter , some have mistakenly shared a rumor that ups will ship for free any package under 50 lbs . to haiti . the destruction of roads and communications networks means our own shipping services to haiti are on hold . rather than offer free shipping to individual donors , ups directs its aid through relief agencies . <PARA> the rumor that jetblue and american airlines have offered to fly doctors and nurses to haiti for free is also false : <PARA> “ last night ’ s hoax on twitter about american and jetblue flying doctors and nurses to haiti for free was just that — a hoax . we don ’ t know who is responsible , but it ’ s a very low thing to do ,” american airlines spokesman tim smith said . <PARA> a spokeswoman for jetblue said the airline is flying relief workers from agencies such as the american red cross free of charge to santo domingo in the neighboring dominican republic , but only after they have been vetted by the haitian consulate . the consulate then arranges transportation for passengers from santo domingo to port - au - prince , she said . “ we ’ re not offering free transportation for just any doctors who walk up and want to fly there .” <PARA> a spokeswoman for jetblue said the airline is flying relief workers from agencies such as the american red cross free of charge to santo domingo in the neighboring dominican republic , but only after they have been vetted by the haitian consulate . the consulate then arranges transportation for passengers from santo domingo to port - au - prince , she said . “ we ’ re not offering free transportation for just any doctors who walk up and want to fly there .” <PARA> according to a t - mobile press release , that company is temporarily allowing their customers to phone haiti without being charged for international long distance calls : <PARA> for current t - mobile customers who are trying to connect with loved ones in haiti during the aftermath of the country ’ s devastating earthquake , t - mobile usa is enabling phone calls to haiti without charges for international long distance through january 31 , 2010 , and retroactive to the earthquake on january 12 , 2010 . additionally , t - mobile customers who may already be in haiti will be able to roam on t - mobile ’ s partner networks in haiti ( operated locally in haiti under the names voila and digicel ) free - of - charge through the end of the month . in both cases , t - mobile will remove these charges from customer bills accordingly . <PARA> anyone wishing to provide additional donations or assistance to haiti should contact the center for international disaster information ( cidi ).
mixture	in 2018 florida once again became the epicenter of controversy in close - call elections , and the related recounts and lawsuits caused social media users to unleash more election fraud conspiracy theories <PARA> on 10 november 2018 , the conspiratorial web site gateway pundit added to the confusion by falsely reporting that election workers in broward county had twice witnessed officials filling out blank absentee ballots . the information gateway pundit published was based on a tweet posted by jeff kottkamp , a former lieutenant governor of florida : <PARA> although the information kottkamp posted was accurate , there was much more to the story . for starters , the event took place in 2016 ; and contrary to what gateway pundit reported , only one such incident occurred . but by 13 november 2018 , amid simmering controversy over florida election recounts , butchered , confusing versions of the story went viral and led anxious readers to believe it referred to current events . <PARA> in november 2016 , chelsey marie smith , a temp worker at the supervisor of elections office ( soe ) in broward county , filed an affidavit reporting that she saw election officials filling out blank absentee ballots , believing she was seeing evidence of voter fraud in action . smith stated she was then abruptly terminated . after investigating , however , the florida state attorney ’ s office in broward county found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing . <PARA> in the affidavit , smith stated that she was sent to deliver a stack of absentee ballot requests to a room in the office known as pitney - bowers . when she got the door , she noted it was locked and a key code was needed to get inside . when she was let through the door , smith witnessed several election officials filling out blank absentee ballots . <PARA> if smith had witnessed voter fraud in action , it would have been a crime . upon investigation , however , timothy donnelly , assistant state attorney in charge of the public corruption unit in broward county found no evidence of wrongdoing . instead , he wrote in a 15 may 2017 memo that elections officials were creating duplicate ballots for soldiers stationed overseas who had faxed in absentee ballots : <PARA> smith ’ s affidavit was filed with the 17th judicial circuit court as an exhibit in a 11 november 2018 lawsuit resulting from one of the state ’ s narrow elections . filed by agriculture commission candidate matthew caldwell , the suit alleged that ballots were illegally counted after polls closed on election day . the affidavit , signed by smith on 3 november 2016 , was submitted to support caldwell ’ s accusations of misconduct against dr . brenda snipes , broward county ’ s elections supervisor . <PARA> caldwell , a republican , filed suit after eking out what he expected to be a victory against challenger nikki fried , only to have his 40 , 000 - point lead flip to a very narrow margin of a few thousand votes favoring fried . despite an ongoing recount , fried declared victory and announced a transition team . <PARA> in a phone interview on 13 november 2018 , kottkamp criticized broward county election officials for what he called a lack of transparency that has fueled conspiracy theories and panic . for instance , he said , soe officials failed to disclose how many votes were left to count . had they done so , he told us , “ people would know the universe of ballots out there and they could have all done the math . but because they weren ’ t willing to say how many votes were still out there to be counted , people were freaking out . you can understand why people were coming a little unglued about that .” <PARA> kottkamp stated that he felt his tweet was pertinent because the affidavit was brought up in an ongoing november 2018 election - related lawsuit . he also said he did not think the 2016 duplicate ballots should have been filled out behind closed doors and pointed out the broward county soe has been beset by controversy and accusations of mismanagement . her office mistakenly mixed more than a dozen rejected ballots with valid ones . <PARA> meanwhile , without offering evidence , president donald trump and other republicans levied accusations of fraud in florida while current governor and republican u . s . senate candidate rick scott fired off a flurry of lawsuits as the recount is underway , also accusing snipes and other elections officials of counting ballots after the deadline . scott has himself been sued by voter advocates demanding he recuse himself from overseeing the election in which he has a stake . <PARA> despite the chaos , kottkamp expressed optimism that the “ mess ” in florida would be sorted out fairly , saying , “ we ’ ll get there .”
false	a disturbing video of a young woman being burned alive is frequently shared online attached to the claim that the victim was killed for attending a christian prayer service . <PARA> we don ’ t link to this decidedly gruesome footage here , but a screenshot of one of the social media posts promulgating this claim looks like this : <PARA> this video does document a young woman ’ s horrific death , but the back story attached is a work of fiction . <PARA> the event depicted in the video took place in guatemala in may 2015 and can be viewed via the official youtube channel of the . al jazeera news channel . <PARA> the exact details of what was captured in the video are unclear , but local news outlets reported at the time that the 16 - year - old woman was killed for her alleged involvement in the death of a taxi driver . it ’ s still uncertain if she had a hand in the death of 68 - year - old carlos enrique gonzález noriega , or if she just happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time . <PARA> two other people suspected of killing the taxi driver escaped , but this young woman was caught by an angry mob , as desccribed in cnn report about the incident :
false	origins : a <PARA> warning that chemicals or bleaches used in the manufacture of disposable chopsticks posing health hazards first appeared online in january 2005 on a variety of chinese - language bulletin boards , and by march 2005 the english - language version quoted above began making its way into inboxes everywhere . ( the english version cannot properly be termed a translation of those bulletin boards posts in that it is a rewriting of the information they presented rather than a copy of any one of them , or at least not a copy of any post we ’ ve so far located . the “ professor chew ” of the e - mailed alert , for instance was not present in the source article .) <PARA> those bulletin board posts were based on a then year - old china post article cautioning shoppers that a number of ingestibles being sold in stores had been found to contain excessive remnants of preservatives , bleachers , or coloring agents after food inspections had been increased ahead of the expected boom in the sale of edibles for the upcoming chinese lunar new year . those inspections resulted in the bureau of health under the taipei city government discerning that 39 of the 165 food items it examined failed to meet government standards , with many of those delinquent products supplied by well - established <PARA> manufacturers . <PARA> within that news article about non - compliant foodstuffs , in a section about preservative chemicals and dried daylily (“ golden needle ”), passing mention was made of sulfur dioxide ’ s often being found on disposable wooden or bamboo chopsticks . no details were given regarding how much of this compound was routinely discovered on these utensils or how often such discoveries were made . sulfur dioxide ( so2 ), a colorless , water - soluble chemical used for bleaching and preserving foods , fruits , and vegetables , can lead to asthmatic attacks in asthmatics and can cause rashes and abdominal upset in those sensitive to this additive . <PARA> while the u . s . food and drug administration ( fda ) does restrict sulfites such as sulfur dioxide in fresh foods to ten parts per million ( 10 ppm ), it does not impose a limit on how much may be present in canned , dried , or preserved foods , instead requiring those ingestibles to bear a sulfite label declaration . while the triggering of asthma attacks , skin rashes , and abdominal upset are recognized by the fda as symptoms linked to sulfites , that federal regulatory agency is wholly silent on the topic of sulfur dioxide ’ s being a cancer - causing agent . it is fair , therefore , to conclude that professor chew ’ s “ don ’ t come and ask me why you have cancer ” is baseless scaremongering . <PARA> the fda estimates that one out of a hundred people is sulfite - sensitive , and that five percent of those who have asthma are at risk of sulfites triggering a breathing problem for them . while adverse reactions among those who are sulfite - sensitive can be severe , even life - threatening , almost all of the population ( 99 percent of non - asthmatics and 95 percent of asthmatics ) are unharmed by ingested sulfites , including sulfur dioxide . sulfites are not the lurking threat to all and sundry the e - mailed warning makes them out to be , nor do they cause cancer . <PARA> those still worried about potential harm from the sulfur dioxide that might be on the disposable chopsticks they are about to use could follow the advice given for leaching it from dried daylily . china ’ s department of health says 70 % of the sulfur dioxide used as a preservative for that product can be eliminated from it by soaking the foodstuff in cold water for 60 minutes or in warm water for 20 minutes , and that as much as 90 % of the chemical could be eliminated by boiling dried daylily for 20 minutes . <PARA> consumers concerned about the environment might choose to follow the e - mail ’ s advice to foreswear disposable chopsticks altogether . in 1984 in japan alone an estimated 12 billion pairs a year were being used and discarded , and in 2001 in china , 45 billion pairs were being sent to their ancestors . <PARA> barbara “ don ’ t waribashi , be happy ”
false	origins : it ’ s a testimony to the power and effectiveness of film studio publicity departments during the heyday of the studio system in the 1930s and 1940s that much of the apocryphal information they concocted and propagated for publicity ’ s sake continues to be cited as fact many decades later . ( how many times recently have we seen “ ronald reagan ” offered as the answer to the trivia question “ who was warner bros .’ first choice to play the lead in casablanca “?) news was frequently imparted by studio pr departments simply to keep actors ’ names before the public , with little regard for the accuracy of the information — making up and releasing bits of inventive fiction about actors was considered a perfectly legitimate way of maintaining fan interest . colorful tales about stars ’ backgrounds or <PARA> fabricated tidbits about remarkable ( but benign ) aspects of their private lives were common fodder for the publicity machine , as were rumors of unusual contract specifications — that a particular actor was obligated by the terms of his or her contract to remain unmarried , to maintain a weight above or below a specified figure , to learn foreign languages , or to refrain from singing or smiling in public . one of the more frequently - repeated examples of these rumors , as cited in the example above , is the contention that silent film star buster keaton was “ precluded from smiling on screen ” by the terms of his contract , another of those bits of pr apocrypha that continues its tenacious hold as a piece of “ true hollywood lore ” several decades on . <PARA> joseph frank keaton iv — known from early childhood as “ buster ” for his uncanny ability to pull off demanding physical stunts and pratfalls without injury — plied the vaudeville stage from the time he was a tot , starring with his parents in a comedy act billed as “ the three keatons ” and playing the role of a “ human mop ” who was tossed and thrown about the stage by his much larger father . when the mature buster ’ s size and his father ’ s drinking eventually made their stage routine dangerously untenable , buster struck out on his own , and after a chance encounter with popular comedy film star roscoe “ fatty ” arbuckle in new york , he began his film career playing in a series of two - reel arbuckle comedies between 1917 and 1920 . after the virginia rappe scandal effectively ended arbuckle ’ s career , arbuckle ’ s producer , joseph m . schenck , signed keaton to a film contract giving him complete artistic control over his output . throughout the 1920s keaton turned out a brilliant series of comedic shorts and feature films renowned for their inventiveness , for buster ’ s amazing ability to perform hair - raising stunts , and for his portrayal of an unflappable , unsmiling character in a porkpie hat who steadfastly maintained the same deadpan facial expression no matter what calamity or misfortune befell him ( which led to keaton ’ s being tagged as “ the great stone face ”). <PARA> unfortunately , the advent of sound films and the onset of the great depression resulted in keaton ’ s losing his independence as a filmmaker , and in 1928 he signed as a contract player with mgm , where he starred in a series of films which were ill - suited to his unique talents and afforded him little opportunity for creative input . his increasing dependence upon alcohol led to the termination of his mgm contract in 1932 , and from then on he was reduced to acting in bit parts , serving as an <PARA> uncredited gag writer , and working as an assistant director until stage appearances and a renewed interest in his silent film work sparked a “ buster keaton revival ” in the 1950s , culminating in the production of a 1957 feature film biography , the buster keaton story ( which , sadly , had little in common with the real events of buster keaton ’ s life ). <PARA> never in his career did buster keaton work under a film contract forbidding him from smiling , however . none of the contracts keaton signed prior to 1924 has survived , and it would have been improbable for any of them to have contained such a clause . his “ stone face ” character had not yet been fully formed when he served his film apprenticeship with fatty arbuckle ( in his screen debut , as a customer in the arbuckle short “ the butcher boy ,” for example , keaton smiles , laughs , and mugs for the camera ), and it would have been rather pointless for joseph schenck to have signed keaton to a contract granting him complete autonomy in his filmmaking , yet handicapping him by restricting the facial expressions he was allowed to use ! indeed , the 1924 contract between schenck and keaton , as described by biographer tom dardis , was a “ standard artist ’ s contract of eight pages , written in businesslike english , with only one slight departure ” ( and the “ departure ” had nothing to do with keaton ’ s smiling on - screen ). <PARA> documentary evidence aside , the idea that buster keaton ’ s contract would have included a stipulation ( as anything other than a publicity stunt ) preventing him from smiling in his film appearances is nonsensical , for a couple of important reasons : <PARA> there are many things — particularly the many inventive aspects of his comedic filmmaking craft — for which buster keaton should be remembered , but attributing one of his best - known , endearing trademarks to a contractual clause imposed upon him by a studio rather than his own creativity does a remarkable man an injustice .
false	in january 2019 , a screenshot of a tweet purportedly posted by congresswoman rashida tlaib , a muslim , about how “ americans ” had been “ raping and pillaging ” her people for decades began to spread on social media networks : <PARA> this was not a genuine tweet from rashida tlaib . <PARA> although some posters presented this screenshot as if it showed a message that tlaib had tweeted and then quickly deleted , this tweet was never posted to the congresswoman ’ s twitter account . <PARA> a common tactic of internet trolls is to impersonate celebrities and politicians by creating social media handles that resemble the legitimate handles of their targets . in this case , someone created a handle which used a capital “ i ” instead of a lower case “ l ” in the congresswoman ’ s last name . <PARA> this account was eventually deleted ( along with the offending tweet ), but we managed to find ( and archive ) a cached version of it : <PARA> while it may be difficult to discern the difference between “ tiaib ” ( with a capital “ i ”) and tlaib ( with a lower case “ l ”) due to the most prevalent font on twitter , when we cut and pasted this handle into a word document and change the font to comic sans , it was clear that this was the tactic employed by this impostor account : <PARA> in addition to the differing urls , viewers could have deduced that this tweet was fake due to the lack of a verified check mark . in addition to correctly spelling her own name , rashida tlaib ’ s genuine twitter account has been verified by by twitter :
false	“ big brother ” rumors ( often linked to the “ mark of the beast ” referenced in revelation 13 : 16 - 18 ) warning that the government will ultimately require all citizens to be implanted with microchips have been around just about as long as microchips have , and specific claims that health care reform legislation will require such implantations date to the clinton administration . so , the warning reproduced above — that health care reform legislation passed by the u . s . congress in 2010 would require “ this sort of device be implanted in the majority of people who opt to become covered by the public health care option ” — is nothing new under the sun . this warning is also just as false as all such previous rumors , a combination of someone ’ s using inapplicable source material and also misunderstanding the meaning of the information contained within that source . <PARA> first off , the referenced information was not part of the “ obamacare ” health care legislation actually enacted by congress . the page numbers and language cited in the example above were taken from hr 3200 , an early house version of health care reform legislation which was never passed by congress ; passages cited from hr 3200 are therefore irrelevant . the cited wording did not appear in the replacement bill ( hr 3590 ) eventually passed as the patient protection and affordable care act , and although similar language was included in initial versions of the subsequent reconciliation bill ( hr 4872 ), it too did not appear in the final version of that bill as passed by congress . <PARA> second , nothing in any of those unpassed bills mandated that anyone be implanted with any type of microchip or rfid - based device , for any reason . the passages quoted above reference a section of the legislation that simply called for the creation of a registry which would allow the department of health and human services to collect data about medical devices “ used in or on a patient ” ( such as pacemakers or hip replacements ) for purposes that included tracking the effectiveness of such devices and facilitating the distribution of manufacturer recall notices . absolutely nothing in those bills required that patients receive any type of implantable device ( microchip or otherwise ) or authorized the government to mandate the implantation of devices in patients . <PARA> updates : a 28 july 2013 article about implanted microchips being “ given a test run on the proud and patriotic citizens of hanna , wyoming ” was mistaken by many readers for a genuine news story . however , that article was just a spoof from the satirical national report web site . <PARA> the rumors made another appearance in the fall of 2016 , when various stories began to appear once again about rfid chip implantations , this time mandatory as of 2017 rather than 2013 . needless to say , these rumors were also completely false .
true	origins : on 2 february 2015 , the animal rights website their turn published an article reporting actor matthew mcconaughey owns a ranch in texas that sells canned hunts ( i . e ., hunts in which the prey is kept in confined areas ): <PARA> mcconaughey purchased the lp ranch in 2001 . six years later , the ranch decided it was time to expand by selling canned hunts . for visitors spending the night , the ranch offers old west accommodations with a modern touch so that after the hunt , our guests can feel assured to eat some great meals and relax in all out comfort ( unlike the animals who they killed for fun that day ). <PARA> the lp ranch , which is owned by matthew mcconaughey , his wife camilia alves , and his brother mike “ rooster ” mcconaughey , is primarily used to raise angus beef cattle . however , in 2007 the ranch built a high - fence area in order to bring customers out to participate in captive whitetail deer hunts : <PARA> in 2007 , we decided it was time to expand . so , we chose to high fence the headquarters in irion county which allows for better management and maintenance of our deer herd . with a young deer herd , we feel extremely blessed to have had a great gene pool from the beginning . <PARA> while it ’ s true the actor purchased the lp ranch with his brother in 2001 , he reportedly has very little to do with the operation of the business . a profile in men ’ s journal noted the actor occasionally uses the ranch as a getaway , and in a 2013 interview , madison mcconaughey , lp ranch cattle manager and the actor ’ s nephew , said while the academy award winner does help with the day - to - day operations while he is on the premises , he spends very little time at the ranch and focuses on the cattle - raising aspect : <PARA> when i asked madison why matthew felt is was important to raise angus cattle and support the beef industry , he said matthew feels it is a part of his family ’ s heritage that he wants to embrace , and it is important to produce high - quality beef . <PARA> there are approximately 1 , 000 high - fence hunting operations in the united states .

true	examples : [ collected via e - mail , 2006 ] <PARA> origins : most <PARA> of us see hummingbirds as shy , skittish little creatures that dart away if they so much as think someone is looking at them , so the idea that ( as pictured above ) these tiny birds would willingly come to land and feed on a person ’ s hand seems rather remarkable . however , training hummingbirds to hand - feed is not as difficult as one might think and can be accomplished with the right approach and a bit of patience . <PARA> the images displayed here were taken from the gallery of <PARA> photographer sam alfano of pine , louisiana , who snapped pictures of his wife abigail feeding hummingbirds in september 2006 . as mrs . alfano told us : <PARA> i am abigail alfano , sam ’ s wife , the lady in the photos . thank you for your interest . we are amazed by how much attention these photos have recieved . if i had any idea that they would have circulated all over the world like they have , i would have worn make - up that morning !!!!

false	origins : positing improbable military backgrounds for popular entertainment figures is a common urban legend motif these days . such tales don ’ t merely put stars in uniform as ordinary servicemen — these questionable claims establish the unlikeliest of entertainers as combat - tested veterans who have displayed high levels of skill , courage , and toughness . thus we have legends positioning pop singer john denver as a vietnam - era army sniper , <PARA> gentle children ’ s host fred rogers as a tattooed marksman with a plethora of confirmed kills , and bob keeshan ( better known to generations of tv - watching youngsters as captain kangaroo ) as a hero of the world war ii battle for iwo jima . ( of the three , only keeshan actually served in the military , and he saw no combat action .) <PARA> another legend of this ilk casts don knotts , best known as the bumbling deputy sheriff barney fife on the andy griffith show and the pop - eyed , leisure - suited <PARA> landlord ralph furley on three ’ s company , as not just the unlikeliest serviceman since gomer pyle , but as the toughest and most fearsome of all military figures : a u . s . marine corps drill instructor . <PARA> the only connection between legend and real life in this case is that don knotts did serve in the military . born the youngest of four brothers in morgantown , west virginia , in 1924 , young don knotts embarked on an entertainment career by performing as a ventriloquist at local venues ; after <PARA> high school he tried a brief stint in new york city and took a stab at attending west virginia university before being drafted by the army in mid - 1943 . although the u . s . was <PARA> in the midst of fighting world war ii at the time , don knotts saw no combat ( and was certainly not a drill sergeant ) — he was tapped for a special services unit and spent his hitch touring the pacific islands to entertain troops as a comedian in a g . i . variety show . after the war he ditched ventriloquism in favor of comedy , landed small spots in radio and on broadway , and worked his way up the entertainment ladder to more prominent comedic roles in television and movies . ( his portrayal of <PARA> barney fife eventually won him five consecutive emmy awards for best supporting actor in a television series .) don knotts also had one other military connection of the cinematic variety : he played the character of corporal john c . brown in stage and film versions of no time for sergeants . <PARA> why so many rumors about entertainers as military figures ? the prevalence of this legend type can probably be attributed to the appeal of imagining popular stars as the polar opposites of their on - stage personas : just as we ’ re intrigued by the notion that macabre rocker marilyn manson once portrayed the geeky paul pfeiffer character on tv ’ s the wonder years , so we ’ re fascinated with the notion that a slight , skinny man best known for playing a series of fumbling , high - strung , nervous characters was once one of world war ii ’ s “ most feared drill instructors .” legends like these confirm the belief that we never know what improbable paths life might lead us down and that appearances can be deceiving .

mixture	on 24 october 2016 , health insurance broker tyler mcclosky created a phenomenon on facebook when he posted a screen shot of what it would cost for a family of four with a total household income of $ 98 , 000 in lee county , florida , to buy insurance on the affordable care act ’ s marketplace : <PARA> we were able to recreate mcclosky ’ s viral post using the shopping tool at healthcare . gov and the same data he entered ( two non - smoking parents with a combined income of $ 98 , 000 and two 8 - year - old children in lee county , florida ): <PARA> but data sent by a department of health and human services official pointed out that 81 percent of families of that size on an obamacare plan have household incomes of less than $ 48 , 000 . so the average family currently subscribing to obamacare would not be paying nearly as much as the image above depicts in their out - of - pocket premium costs . we entered the same data but changed the income to $ 48 , 000 here : <PARA> mcclosky created the post on 24 october 2016 , the same day a report by the department of health and human services was released detailing an average 25 percent increase in costs to the affordable care act ( obamacare ) customers : <PARA> this figure varies based on locale . for instance , a table compiled by the kaiser family foundation shows that people in phoenix , arizona will have a 145 percent premium increase , but a tax subsidy will mean a 40 - year - old , non - smoking phoenix resident with a $ 30 , 000 annual income will not have to pay any more than last year ( which is roughly $ 207 a month , depending on the plan selected ). <PARA> according to data sent by the department of health and human services ( hhs ), a majority of consumers covered by the aca ( 85 percent ) qualify for tax credits that keep pace with premium increases , so many won ’ t see much of an impact on their out - of - pocket costs . <PARA> but mcclosky was addressing people whose income disqualifies them from that assistance . he told us he used the $ 98 , 000 annual income as an example because that is the threshold at which households of four with two children do not qualify for tax credit assistance ( you qualify if you make up to 400 percent of the federal poverty line ). he said he created the post because he wanted to raise awareness about what it costs to insure a family in which each adult is making an annual salary of $ 44 , 000 , and neither has access to employer - based health care — a fairly common situation in the united states . <PARA> his concern , he said , is that only consumers who qualify for a tax subsidy can afford insurance under aca . if their incomes are too high to qualify for assistance , they may simply go without . while the number of uninsured americans dropped under aca , as of 2015 , 28 . 5 million people still lack coverage . per the kaiser family foundation : <PARA> eric seiber , associate professor of health services management and policy at ohio state , said that the health care system in the united states is the most expensive in the world , and costs have steadily increased over the years . despite its name , the affordable care act doesn ’ t actually address the cost of health care itself : <PARA> people ’ s perception that their wages have been flat is an effect of compensation increases going to cover rising healthcare costs instead of into their paychecks , seiber said . <PARA> mcclosky , who sells health and life insurance plans in florida , said that the affordable care act has had the effect of diminishing competition among carriers . for instance , lee county residents can only purchase blue cross blue shield . prices in miami - dade are lower than in lee county , because there are more carriers competing with each other . <PARA> mcclosky says insurance carriers have been squeezed by part of the mandate which requires them to spend 80 to 85 percent on claim payouts and health care quality improvement . he pointed to assurant , a 123 - yea - old insurer that specialized in individual and small business plans . they could not survive under the aca and filed for bankruptcy in 2015 . <PARA> health care is a source of roiling political debate for years . while the cost of health plans under obamacare will go up an average 25 percent as of 1 november 2016 , the majority of consumers won ’ t experience much change in their out - of - pocket costs when open enrollment starts for 2017 , because the tax credits will buffer that increase . further , as the new york times pointed out , many americans are shielded from the immediate costs of health care by employer - based insurance or the public programs : <PARA> however , as mcclosky ’ s post makes clear , whether people notice it or not , american health care costs are high — and not everyone can qualify for available assistance .
false	portraying one ’ s opponents as elitist , out - of - touch hypocrites with little or no concern for others is an old and common practice in u . s . politics , and there is perhaps no better modern example of the application of that concept than the infamous “ runway haircut ” received by president bill clinton in 1993 . <PARA> the story , as commonly reported back in may 1993 , was that president bill clinton hubristically had air force one held idle on the tarmac at los angeles international airport ( lax ) so that his personal stylist could board the plane and perform a $ 200 presidential haircut — completely oblivious to ( or unconcerned about ) the fact that his action triggered the shutdown of half the airport ’ s runways and caused incoming flights to be placed in holding patterns for the duration : <PARA> the air traffic - diverting $ 200 haircut was one of the major news stories of its day , garnering front - page headlines in such major newspapers as the new york times , the los angeles times , and the boston globe . the washington post , who quipped that clinton had received “ the most famous haircut since samson ,” included the incident in nine front - page stories over the span of six weeks . nearly two decades later , major news publications such as time magazine were still referencing “ hairgate ” and stating that the notorious runway haircut had resulted in a “ hold on air traffic ” that “ forced [ flights ] to circle and made los angeles air travelers “ hours late ”: <PARA> and yet , outside of the fact that president clinton did receive a haircut on air force one while the presidential plane sat on an lax runway , virtually none of the oft - repeated details of “ hairgate ” was true . by the end of the following month , news sources such as newsday had already obtained and reported on federal aviation administration ( faa ) records documenting that the “ haircut caused no significant delays of regularly scheduled passenger flights — no circling planes , no traffic jams on the runways .” the single negative outcome of the event was that one unscheduled air taxi flight took off two minutes late : <PARA> and yet , corrections to the story that had been featured so prominently and so often in major news publication articles and on television network news reports were scant and cursory : <PARA> the los angeles times , in a lengthy three - part series , hypothesized that the inaccurate reporting of “ hairgate ” was driven by the press corps ’ resentment over their treatment by the white house , which “ led to overblown and hostile stories about clinton ”: <PARA> in fact , even the one true aspect of the hairgate story was likely exaggerated . later reports noted that clinton ’ s “$ 200 haircut ” likely “ cost less than $ 150 , perhaps far less ( the hairdresser charged $ 150 for a first - time haircut , but clinton was an established customers and thus paid less ).”
unproven	on 8 october 2015 , the web site the right scoop published the above - reproduced missive as an article headlined “ must watch : whistleblower doctor explains horrific reality dealing with muslim invaders in germany ” — not long afterwards , verbatim versions of the same commentary began circulating in an e - mail frequently titled “ a female physician in munich , germany sends a warning message to the world ...” the right scoop claimed credit for transcribing the letter from the video embedded above ; but whether that translation is an accurate one is unclear . a longer version of the same clip was uploaded to youtube on 6 october 2015 , and both clips began with what appeared to be repetition of an older rumor involving refugees and oktoberfest . <PARA> the source of the missive was apparently an on - air reading by a czech newscaster , who recited what was said to be a letter from a czech doctor treating immigrants in a german hospital . its assertions were a blend of difficult - to - verify first - person claims and opinion ( mixed with a measure of undiluted misinformation ), its purported author was an unnamed “ female physician ,” and a handful of its talking points were claims about incidents at an unidentified munich hospital in the weeks following an influx of middle eastern refugees to germany in september 2015 . ( the piece was almost certainly veiled criticism of german citizens who had welcomed asylum - seekers with open arms a few weeks prior to its circulation .) <PARA> like earlier polemics written from the perspective of an authority figure , the occupation of the writer served to bolster the e - mail ’ s claims and lend credibility to them — it ’ s difficult to imagine the item ’ s gaining such traction had it been the perspective of a barista or dog walker . the claims contained in the letter were not dated ( making it easier for them to circulate in perpetuity ), so verifying even the scant collection of non - opinion statements offered in the e - mail is difficult . <PARA> in its first portion the writer claimed that “ muslims ” had “ refused ” to be treated by female doctors ( and that “ and , we , women , are refusing to go among those animals , especially from africa ”): <PARA> aids , syphilis , and tuberculosis are hardly diseases modern doctors would consider “ exotic ,” and it beggars belief that anyone ( particularly a “ physician ”) would claim medical professionals “ don ’ t know how to treat them .” there ’ s some truth to the assertion muslim men might eschew care from female doctors , as a 2010 new york times article explained : <PARA> however , that same piece also covered the larger issue of patient comfort and bedside manner ; and open contempt for patients ( as expressed by the putative author of the letter from a munich hospital ) is unusual in medical settings , where most doctors and nurses are accustomed to providing care to all , whether or not those interactions are pleasant . <PARA> the munich physician ’ s letter also stated : <PARA> as of july 2015 there were an estimated 2 . 8 million people registered as unemployed in germany , and the author didn ’ t cite any source for predictions that number would rise to 3 . 5 million based on an influx of asylum seekers . the “ one in 10 is pregnant ” figure is an admitted estimation by the e - mail ’ s writer , for which we could find no corroborating evidence ( and it further stands to reason that pregnant refugees would seek medical care with higher frequency than women in general , for obvious reasons ). however , it should be noted that that overall claim deviated significantly from other popular refugee rumors which consistently described those seeking asylum as predominantly men of “ fighting age .” <PARA> the missive went on to state : <PARA> the notion that spikes in immigration lead to outbreaks of disease is a common theme among rumors that circulate during crises that drive large numbers of people out of a given area . media speculation about such public health concerns inevitably follows ; but ( as the author conceded ) those predictions have not come to pass in connection with syrian refugees . we were unable to find any news reports that any hospital workers near the rhine had been attacked by refugees at any point in 2015 in the manner described by the author . <PARA> the e - mail continued by stating : <PARA> precisely what “ it ” the “ local press [ was ] forbidden ” to report was left to the reader ’ s preconceptions ( presumably the alleged attacks on medical personnel by immigrants ); but news coverage about the ongoing refugee crisis wasn ’ t subject to any blackout or other restriction ( as attested to by comprehensive global news coverage of the situation ). the author seemed to hint that similar e - mails were the source for the claims , accounts that proliferate on social media but don ’ t appear in the news . however , the reason for the absence of such accounts from the news media is far more likely their dubious credibility than any sort of censorship of reporting , which itself creates a self - propelling narrative of widespread suppression . <PARA> the author of this missive concluded : <PARA> the writer seems to suggest as a footnote that the crowds of germans who warmly received refugees weeks earlier were paid by unnamed parties , insinuating that the sole motivation for their display of welcome was financial . as it stands , no one has stepped forward to claim authorship of the popular polemic ; and a number of its assertions are shaky , unsupported , or simply opinion - based ( such as the repeated description of african people as “ animals ”). were there any truth to its claims , there ’ s no demonstrable reason why that information would be subject to a “ blackout ” of any description ; and even the conspiracy - level censorship alleged by the writing would be unlikely to stop such reports from reaching the world at large through social media and blogs . <PARA> variations : the name of dr . barbara sziraki has since become attached to this message , but she appears to be a los angeles psychologist who simply forwarded the letter via e - mail and not a czech physician working in germany .
unproven	in june 2016 the notoriously unreliable web site health impact news published an article reporting that agents of alabama ’ s child protective services ( cps ) had stormed a hospital and taken a newborn baby away from its 14 - year - old mother solely because the child was conceived during a rape : <PARA> as described , the chain of events indeed sounded harrowing . each police officer and alabama department of human resources ( dhr ) official involved in the incident was depicted or mentioned by name , and health impact news added an update reporting that the young mother and her twin brother were also taken into state custody : <PARA> we contacted alabama ’ s cps department with the expectation that the agency would be unable to comment on the specifics of the case , and as is frequently the case with such rumors , the individual with whom we spoke stated that the agency could not provide any details due to the nature of the claims . however , that representative told us that under alabama state law , the agency has 72 hours to present a case to a judge proving that removal of a child or children from the care of parents or guardians is in the best interest of the minor [ s ], and alabama law indeed holds [ pdf ] that : <PARA> the same laws provide for removal as a last resort in any open case : <PARA> per alabama state law , child protective services agents must “ offer all appropriate services to prevent removal of [ a ] child ,” “ unless that child is in immediate danger of harm or threatened harm .” presumably , state workers will be obliged to present evidence that summary removal was necessary within the 72 - hour window mandated by the state . <PARA> stories like the alabama cps claim achieve viral traction on social media in large part because child protection agencies are prohibited by law from commenting on individual cases , making it very difficult for independent sources to challenge one - sided stories presented online . in one notable instance , health impact news and medical kidnap heavily publicized , without critical examination , a family ’ s false claim that cps agents had taken their children simply because they opted for a homebirth . <PARA> cps agencies are often painted as capriciously snatching children without valid cause , and “ media blackouts ” or “ suppression ” are then cited as the reason for a lack of news coverage of such reports ( rather than that news organizations might be cautious about running with unverifiable , one - sided stories ): <PARA> news outlets are generally unable to verify a family ’ s claims in any given cps dispute , which creates the risk of unwarranted public alarm being generated from incidents that have practical and reasonable explanations . it ’ s possible that the child removals in the case cited here were tied to a 14 - year - old girl ’ s traumatic assault , but it ’ s equally possible cps agents sought summary removal of all three children for entirely different reasons .
false	on 10 september 2016 , the associated media coverage web site published an article reporting that the united states federal government had announced a new traffic safety regulation barring minors from riding as passengers on motorcycles : <PARA> there was no truth to the story . associated media coverage is a fake news site that typically spreads falsehoods regarding to non - existent laws or statutes which would affect a specific subset of the population . unlike other “ satire ” sites , associated media coverage does not carry a disclaimer identifying its content as fiction . <PARA> neither the united states department of transportation nor the american motorcyclists association ( ama ) has made any announcements regarding a new safety regulation that would ban children from riding as passengers on motorcycles , other than to post on facebook that the item referenced above is bogus :
false	sometimes , the circulation of misinformation revives interest in separate , similar , but still inaccurate claims . this appeared to be the case with a march 2016 internet rumor alleging that the food and drug administration classified walnuts as drugs . <PARA> in february and march 2016 , the fda was already the subject of rumors that the agency “ outlawed ” cannabidiol ( cbd ) oils . almost immediately , rumors began to surface on social media that walnuts had also recently fallen prey to preposterous reclassification by the fda . <PARA> while the rumors weren ’ t new , interest in whether walnuts were drugs spiked in march 2016 . many social media users linked to a realfarmacy item from 2013 . on 23 march 2016 , the facebook page “ living traditionally ” shared the 2013 article as if its claims were new : <PARA> the 2013 article claimed that fda sent letters to walnut distributor diamond foods deeming that their “ walnut products [ were ] drugs ”: <PARA> realfarmacy also claimed that manufacturers ’ first amendment rights were being infringed by the fda ’ s regulation of unsubstantiated health claims : <PARA> the site linked to a letter publicly shared on the fda ’ s website , which was already several years old by the time the 2013 article was published , and which plainly indicated that its action was due to health claims made about walnuts in labeling and marketing : <PARA> no part of the letter said ( or even implied ) that walnuts had been subjected to a sweeping reclassification as drugs , and in the ensuing six years , no one was arrested for or charged with possession of walnuts with intent to distribute . additionally , the fda didn ’ t ban , regulate , or demand withdrawal of diamond foods ’ walnuts , or any other , from the market , but did go after the company for unauthorized health claims : <PARA> as with claims that cbd oils were outlawed , blogs and facebook pages spreading rumors that walnuts had been reclassified as drugs either didn ’ t read or misrepresented the fda ’ s warning letters . in both instances , manufacturers were warned about use of marketing and labeling language that warranted classification of the products in question as drugs , primarily pertaining to suggestion that the substances or foods were “ intended to diagnose , treat , cure , or prevent any condition .” <PARA> the warnings were specifically due an “ unauthorized health claim ,” and products that are not classified as drugs by the fda are not legally allowed to make such claims . however , the letters in no way indicated that walnuts had been classified as drugs . <PARA> prior dubious items from realfarmacy included claims that science disproved a link between sun exposure and skin cancer , and another baselessly accusing unspecified pro - gmo bioterrorists of sabotaging chipotle ’ s product supply with foodborne pathogens .
false	a smear piece targeting u . s . rep . adam schiff swept a california businessman and engineer into the mix and , in doing so , potentially endangered his child . <PARA> on sept . 29 , 2019 , the right - leaning website the gateway pundit posted a story headlined , “ explosive report : rep . adam schiff linked to prominent ukrainian arms dealer !” the purported “ arms dealer ” in the story is igor pasternak , who is neither a prominent arms dealer nor a ukrainian . <PARA> soon after the gateway pundit story was published , fox news primetime host laura ingraham boosted the same narrative on her own widely watched program . both outlets were lashing out in defense of u . s . president donald trump , who is facing an impeachment inquiry spearheaded by schiff , a democrat from california who chairs the house intelligence committee . <PARA> trump is accused of using his office to obtain damaging information on a political rival from the ukrainian government . thus both the gateway pundit and ingraham attempted to make the case that schiff had equally inappropriate dealings with ukraine . but the story is thin , based entirely on the fact that pasternak , an engineer and business owner , hosted a fundraiser for schiff in 2013 . <PARA> fox news falsely reported that pasternak “ moved his corporation into [ schiff ’ s ] california district ” and stated without proof that schiff “ could have ” traded political favors for campaign donations . <PARA> pasternak ’ s company , worldwide aeros corp , is based in montebello , california , and is not in schiff ’ s congressional district ( pasternak ’ s district is the 38th , represented by linda sanchez ). pasternak , who spoke to us by phone , said neither fox nor the gateway pundit reached out to him for his side of the story . <PARA> the gateway pundit story claims pasternak “ sold arms in places like syria ” and “ has also been connected to [ billionaire philanthropist ] george soros .” this is a laughable fantasy , pasternak said . <PARA> “ it ’ s not like stretching of the truth or a misrepresent the facts ,” pasternak told us . “ it just has nothing to do with reality .” <PARA> it ’ s also not a new narrative . the same story floated in 2018 on a different website , that time in response to a memo authored by schiff detailing russian meddling in the 2016 election . <PARA> pasternak did host a fundraiser for schiff in 2013 , but he told us he has donated to multiple politicians , both democratic and republican , a statement that can be confirmed by searching his name on the government transparency tool open secrets . and he did design some military hardware , including small arms and surveillance equipment , which were used by the ukrainian military in that country ’ s conflict with russian forces . <PARA> but his company ’ s main occupation is the manufacture of airships , also known as lighter - than - air aircraft . furthermore , pasternak was raised in ukraine but was born in kazakhstan . he is also an american citizen . his mother tongue is russian , he told us . he doesn ’ t speak ukrainian . <PARA> pasternak took the gateway pundit ’ s smear against him in stride , joking that the website had publicized “ the best picture of me .” <PARA> but what attracted his concern was that the story included a collage of images , some of which pasternak believes were taken from his facebook account . in that collage were not only pictures of his young son but the boy ’ s name . the story also contained the family ’ s home address . the information has been posted by various troll accounts on social media , prompting pasternak to contact authorities . <PARA> “ it really to me is not a joke ,” pasternak told us . “ if it was just me , then ok , thank you for publicizing my best picture .” but pasternak , who like soros is jewish , read it in a threatening light , noting the collage contained more images of his child than of him . “ they clearly understand he ’ s the most vulnerable point for me .” <PARA> soros , whose foundation donates money to progressive causes , is the frequent target of anti - semitic conspiracy theories . <PARA> pasternak said he didn ’ t make any money off the equipment sent to the ukrainian military and elected to do so after becoming emotionally moved while visiting maidan square shortly after deadly clashes with protesters and police in 2014 . pasternak said it ’ s possible he has been the target of disinformation because his pro - ukraine activities in the face of ukraine ’ s conflict with russia got him on “ putin ’ s bad list .” <PARA> since at least 2014 , the russians have harnessed social media in the u . s . to spread disinformation to influence public opinion , a technique they deployed in their 2016 u . s . election - interference operation . <PARA> we reached out to gateway pundit founder jim hoft , asking why the story on his website included the identity and photograph of an uninvolved child , but received no response . <PARA> although we normally link to stories we fact check , we chose not to do so in this case because the pundit story identifies a child and contains his picture and address .
false	in june 2019 , a number of social media users started sharing an old satirical article from the website “ there is news ” about a trapeze artist with diarrhea who reportedly defecated on 23 people at a circus in spain : <PARA> this was not a genuine news story . <PARA> this story was originally published by there is news , a website that carries the tagline “ not real , but so funny ,” in march 2019 . a disclaimer on the website explains that there is news “ is a humor site whose purpose is entertainment ” and that the content on the website is “ fiction and does not correspond to reality .” <PARA> the image featured in this article also doesn ’ t show the “ belgian circus .” it is available via wikipedia where it is presented as if it shows “ trapecistas en circo americano .” the image available via wikipedia does not blur the faces of these trapeze artists ( most likely because they weren ’ t involved in an embarrassing diarrhea - related incident ): <PARA> this isn ’ t the first time we ’ ve encountered feces - focused satire . in october 2014 , we addressed a photograph that supposedly showed a cheerleader suffering an embarrassing accident as she was thrown into the air .
mixture	examples : <PARA> muslims out of australia ! <PARA> canberra australia : muslims who want to live under islamic sharia law were told on wednesday to get out of australia , as the government targeted radicals in a bid to head off potential terror attacks . a day after a group of mainstream muslim leaders pledged loyalty to australia at a special meeting with prime minister john howard , he and his ministers made it clear that extremists would face a crackdown . <PARA> treasurer peter costello , seen as heir apparent to howard , hinted that some radical clerics could be asked to leave the country if they did not accept that australia was a secular state and its laws were made by parliament . “ if those are not your values , if you want a country which has sharia law or a theocratic state , then australia is not for you ,” he said on national television . “ i ’ d be saying to clerics who are teaching that there are two laws governing people in australia , one the australian law and another the islamic law , that is false . <PARA> if you can ’ t agree with parliamentary law , independent courts , democracy , and would prefer sharia law and have the opportunity to go to other country which practices it , perhaps , then , that ’ s a better option ,” costello said . asked whether he meant radical clerics would be forced to leave , he said those with dual citizenship could possibly be asked to move to the other country . <PARA> education minister brendan nelson later told reporters that muslims who did not want to accept local values should “ clear off ”. “ basically , people who don ’ t want to be australians , and they don ’ t want to live by australian values and understand them , well then they can basically clear off ,” he said . separately , howard angered some australian muslims on wednesday by saying he supported spy agencies monitoring the nation ’ s mosques . <PARA> variations : a january 2008 variant combined elements of this piece with a 2001 editorial about immigrants written by a u . s . air force veteran , creating the misleading impression that the hybrid version reflected a speech given by australian prime minister john howard . a february 2009 variant attributed the entire combined version to kevin rudd , who succeeded john howard as australia ’ s prime minister in 2007 , and a 2010 variant attributed elements of both to julia gillard , who succeeded kevin rudd in june 2010 . <PARA> origins : the july 2005 london tube bombings raised domestic terrorism concerns in countries with large immigrant muslim populations , such as australia . the following month , australian prime minister john howard held a two - hour summit with moderate muslim leaders in canberra to work on a national strategy for addressing intolerance and the promotion of violence , during which issues such as the curriculum of islamic schools and suggested measures for vetting imams were discussed . the christian science monitor noted of the event : <PARA> as other governments have found , however , deciding who represents the muslim community can be a delicate matter . large sections of the youth , as well as conservative and more critical clerics , have been left out of howard ’ s summit — meaning some of the government ’ s more aggressive proposals may meet resistance . <PARA> but the groups who attended the meeting hailed it as a successful first step in an ongoing dialogue . <PARA> “ we determined along with the prime minister that there must be more communication between the government and islamic schools where it comes to teaching common values like democracy , fairness , tolerance and so on , and radicals will be reacted to , whenever they make inflammatory <PARA> remarks ,” says ali roude , the acting president of the new south wales islamic council . <PARA> “ it ’ s much worse for us now , because 7 / 7 showed the world that the enemy is to be found within ” instead of 9 / 11 when the terrorists were all foreigners [ said the spokesperson for lebanese muslims in australia ]. “ now they are suspicious of all of us , and it ’ s very serious , but the prime minister is only playing politics .” <PARA> but some muslims here have a growing sense that they are being defined within the media by the voices of the extremists , and that an intervention by the government and moderate muslims to counter such elements would be useful . <PARA> “ so far it was ok to do your own thing . but if the media is focusing on the extreme elements , we need to do something about it ,” says chabaan omran , a senior member of the federation of australian students and youth , an organization that gives religious advice and teaching to young people . “ muslims need to interact more with mainstream australia .” <PARA> this might sit well with recent calls from ordinary australians asking muslims to assimilate . but mr . omran is worried about the connotations of the word “ assimilate ,” and talks more of “ positive integration without undermining our religion .” <PARA> but the groups who attended the meeting hailed it as a successful first step in an ongoing dialogue . <PARA> “ we determined along with

john howard said on top of trying to promote australian values in islamic schools , the government would monitor what was said in certain schools and mosques to ensure they did not foster terrorism . <PARA> asked whether he was prepared to “ get inside ” mosques and schools to ensure there was no support for terrorism , mr howard was blunt . <PARA> “ yes , to the extent necessary ,” mr howard told southern cross radio . <PARA> “ i have no desire and nor is it the government ’ s intention to interfere in any way with the freedom or practice of religion . <PARA> “ we have a right to know whether

television news program on 23 august 2005 : <PARA> tony jones : now , over the past 24 hours you ’ ve been repeating the notion that migrants , evidently islamic migrants , who don ’ t like australia , or australian values , should think of packing up and moving to another country . is that a fair assessment ? <PARA> peter costello : what i ’ ve said is that this is a country , which is founded on a democracy . according to our constitution , we have a secular state . our laws are made by the australian parliament . if those are not your values , if you want a country which has sharia law or a theocratic state , then australia is not for you . this is not the kind of country where you would feel comfortable if you were opposed to democracy , parliamentary law , independent courts and so i

country which practises it , perhaps then that ’ s a better option . <PARA> tony jones : but isn ’ t this the sort of thing you hear in pubs , the meaningless populism you hear on talkback radio ? essentially , the argument is if you don ’ t like it here , you should go back home . <PARA> peter costello : no . essentially , the argument is australia expects its citizens to abide by core beliefs

unproven	examples : [ collected via e - mail , december 2011 ] <PARA> the obama administration told u . s . owned hawker beechcraft earlier this week they are being excluded from bidding on the us air force contract for a light attack aircraft . that leaves brazilian owned embraer as the likely recipient of the lucrative deal . i found this one hard to believe so i did a little research . it was tough because this was completely ignored by the main stream media . <PARA> this is a double slap in the face of the united states . at a time when jobs , the economy , and security are the most critical priorities for our country , the obama administration decides to send a defense contract to a foreign owned company . <PARA> this has to be the stupidest thing this administration has done to date . this is not just a dumb decision , it is a perfect example of why this president is such a poor leader . he talks about wanting jobs . he says we need to force companies to repatriate billions of dollars that americans keep overseas . he wants to raise taxes so he can spend billions on stimulus that does nothing to stimulate anything . <PARA> and when it ’ s time to act , he sends our tax dollars overseas at the expense of american jobs and income for an american company . this is nothing more than a chicago - style political pay back ; but this time it is at the expense of our national security . <PARA> how much more damage will obama be allowed to do in the next 14 months ? one of the lead stories in the media this week blasted congress for insider trading . if this contract goes to embraer it will be a huge pay off to another george soros company . <PARA> when will the 4th estate do it ’ s constitutionally protected job and expose the real obama to the american people ? <PARA> origins : on 30 december 2011 , the u . s . department of defense announced that it had awarded a $ 355 million contract to sierra nevada corp . ( snc ) for 20 light air - support / single - engine turboprop aircraft that will serve as both trainers and ground - attack planes for afghanistan ’ s air force . wichita - based aircraft manufacturer hawker beechcraft ( hbdc ) had hoped that their at - 6 aircraft , an armed version of their t - 6 trainer which is currently used by the u . s . military , would be chosen for the contract , but the u . s . air force ( usaf ) excluded the at - 6 from the running , leaving the a - 29 super tucano built by sierra nevada corp . in partnership with brazil - based embraer as the lone eligible supplier . <PARA> hawker beechcraft corp . has since filed suit against the u . s . government over the exclusion , maintaining that the air force had not provided them with sufficient detail about the reasons behind their exclusion and that embraer had been unfairly favored : <PARA> the suit alleges the exclusion was “ arbitrary and capricious ” and seeks to prevent the government from awarding a contract until beechcraft can make its case in court . <PARA> “ this is yet another example of the air force ’ s lack of transparency throughout this competition ,” said bill boisture , hawker beechcraft chairman and ceo , in a statement . “ with this development , it now seems even clearer that the air force intended to award the contract to embraer from early in this process .” <PARA> “ we think we were wrongfully excluded from the competition ,” boisture said . “ we don ’ t understand the basis for the exclusion , and frankly , we think we ’ ve got the best airplane . “ so we ’ re going to take every avenue available to us to make sure our product is fully evaluated and recognized for what it is . there are several issues here that just , frankly , don ’ t make sense .” <PARA> “ this is yet another example of the air force ’ s lack of transparency throughout this competition ,” said bill boisture , hawker beechcraft chairman and ceo , in a statement . “ with this development , it now seems even clearer that the air force intended to award the contract to embraer from early in this process .” <PARA> “ we think we were wrongfully excluded from the competition ,” boisture said . “ we don ’ t understand the basis for the exclusion , and frankly , we think we ’ ve got the best airplane . “ so we ’ re going to take every avenue available to us to make sure our product is fully evaluated and recognized for what it is . there are several issues here that just , frankly , don ’ t make sense .” <PARA> the air force maintains that the process was fair , that hawker beechcraft was excluded because “ multiple deficiencies and significant weaknesses found in hbdc ’ s proposal make it technically unacceptable and results in unacceptable mission capability risk ,” and that the company failed to respond to its notice of exclusion in time to request a debriefing or file a protest : <PARA> lt . col . wesley miller , an air force spokesman , said the contest “ was conducted in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations ” and that the evaluation of the aircraft “ was fair , open and transparent .” <PARA> in dismissing hawker beechcraft corp from the competition , the air force found hawker beechcraft ’ s bid “ technically unacceptable ,” one that would result in an “ unacceptable mission capability risk .” <PARA> the air force said the company missed a three -

day deadline to file a request for a debriefing and a 10 - day deadline to file a protest . <PARA> it is not possible at this point to definitively determine why the usaf excluded hawker beechcraft from the light aircraft support ( las ) bidding , as ongoing litigation prevents the air force from releasing information regarding the competition , but according to industry observers the primary issue behind hawker beechcraft ’ s disqualification was that the las contract called for a non - developmental , production - ready aircraft , and hawker beechcraft ’ s at - 6 was still a developmental aircraft . <PARA> according to snc ’ s own statement on the issue : <PARA> in its request for proposal , the air force specifically sought a non - developmental , in - production aircraft so that warfighters in - theater could have an advanced solution quickly and so that american taxpayers would not have to pay development costs . the plane proposed by snc ’ s competitor is a developmental aircraft that is not in production and has never been used for light air support or any other purpose . <PARA> the at - 6 is a developmental aircraft . with only two prototypes in existence , it has never been in production . in contrast , the aircraft selected by the air force and to be provided by snc , embraer ’ s a - 29 super tucano , is a light air support aircraft that is currently in use with six air forces around the world . <PARA> unlike the at - 6 , the a - 29 super tucano has more than seven years of real - world combat and training experience behind it . this means that its operational costs are known and that all costly development issues related to weapons load , maneuverability and operations have already been worked out . <PARA> only the a -

29 delivery system is specifically designed with the five nato hard points for external stores , translating into maximum operational flexibility for the war fighters in the theater . the at - 6 carries no munitions in its native configuration . this is a critical difference . the a -

opened for competition and didn ’ t elaborate on the reason for the cancellation . <PARA> “ while we pursue perfection , we sometimes fall short , and when we do we will take corrective action ,” michael b . donley , the air force secretary , said in a statement . “ since the acquisition is still in litigation , i can only say that the air force senior acquisition executive , david van buren , is not satisfied with the quality of the documentation supporting the award decision .” <PARA> “ while we pursue perfection , we sometimes fall short , and when we do we will take corrective action ,” michael b . donley , the air force secretary , said in a statement . “ since the acquisition is still in litigation , i can only say that the air force senior acquisition executive , david van buren , is not satisfied with the quality of the documentation supporting the award decision .” <PARA> the awarding of the air force contract to a partner of brazil - based embraer did not necessarily mean that all the jobs connected with the contract would be sent overseas , as embraer said that its partner , nevada - based sierra nevada corp ., would build the turboprops in jacksonville , florida , if it won the contract : <PARA> the a -

circulation newspapers in the u . s . ( the wall street journal , the washington post , the san jose mercury news , the new york post , and the chicago tribune ). <PARA> also , we found no evidence to support the claim that “ if this contract goes to embraer it will be a huge pay off to another george soros company ,” as we turned up no information indicating that george soros holds an ownership stake in embraer . the closest connection we found between george soros and embraer seems to be that the former is one of the leading shareholders in china ’ s hainan airlines group ( hna ), and hna bought erj - 145 jets from harbin embraer , a partnership between embraer and the harbin aircraft manufacturing corporation of harbin , china . however , that connection makes soros a customer of embraer , not an owner , and therefore does not put him in a position to profit from the awarding of an air force contact to embraer .
false	a number of readers have written to us in the past few years to inquire regarding a rumor they ’ ve heard about arby ’ s , a popular roast beef sandwich franchise . according to scuttlebutt , the meat used by that chain in its sandwiches isn ’ t actually beef but is instead an imitation foodstuff arrived at by reconstituting a powder , gel , paste , or liquid , then shaping the resultant mass into something approaching the appearance of a cut of meat before roasting , cooling , and slicing it . how long this rumor has been out there is hard to say , but it first came to us in 1997 . <PARA> we asked arby ’ s about the meat they use , and here is their response : <PARA> a number of sources of our acquaintance who have worked in the kitchens and at the counters of various arby ’ s bear out what the corporation has to say . they told us that the beef arrives pre - packaged at each restaurant , leaving employees of each franchise only to cut open the plastic , place the roasts on cooking sheets , and cook them for three hours before cooling , slicing , and serving . <PARA> as one of those employees who had been in charge of the meat slicer at an arby ’ s restaurant explained to us , most packaged bulk meat arrives packed in a gelatinous broth inside plastic airtight bags . someone who is less than familiar with what the product looks like upon arrival might mistake the gelatinous broth for the beef itself , then from there jump to the conclusion that the contents of the package is a gel or paste . <PARA> granted , what ’ s inside those airtight bags may not resemble actual roast beef in color or texture ( the meat is kind of grayish and rather soft and squishy , enough so that one could easily poke a finger through it ), but it ’ s still not a liquid , gel or paste . <PARA> rumors about the meat being served by other fast food outlets has been the subject of whispers too . in the 1970s mcdonald ’ s was deviled by the rumor that its hamburgers were made with worm meat . wendy ’ s has apparently also picked up a meat adulteration rumor : <PARA> arby ’ s derived its name , by the way , from the phonetic sound of the initials r . b . however , the “ r . b .” does not , as many folks conclude , represent “ roast beef ” but rather “ raffel brothers ,” the restaurant equipment business owned and operated by forrest and leroy raffel that was the forerunner to the successful sandwich chain . in its history , arby ’ s quotes forrest raffel as saying , “ we came up with arby ’ s , which stands for r . b ., the initials of raffel brothers , although i guess customers might think the initials stand for roast beef .”

true	the above - displayed photographs depict a december 2006 accident in which the driver of 1991 gmc pickup slid off the road onto the right shoulder , overcorrected when he turned back to the left , and crossed over the opposite lane of the highway before crashing though a cement barrier , skirting a railing above a drainage culvert , and coming to rest facing opposite his original direction of travel — barely missing a plunge over a 200 - foot precipice by about twelve inches . <PARA> the roadway seen in these pictures is highway 59 ( i . e ., state route 59 ) near hurricane city , utah : <PARA> the hurricane city police department confirmed that these images “ are consistent with a single vehicle traffic accident that occurred on state route 59 in hurricane city ” on 30 december 2006 , and that “ hurricane city police and hurricane city fire rescue responded to the scene .” the driver told police he was traveling at 55 mph when he left the road , but the police report of the incident notes that the truck left a 92 - foot - long skid mark , suggesting a much higher speed ( perhaps 75 to 80 mph ).
true	in may 2019 , readers questioned whether the federal government pays for erectile dysfunction medications such as viagra , after the following image was circulated on social media : <PARA> both the image and the dollar amount it cited were dated as of this writing . the image shows a woman at a 2017 international women ’ s day rally , while the $ 41 . 6 million figure on her sign was what was spent on viagra by the department of defense in 2014 . <PARA> the image initially made the rounds in relation to a separate controversy in 2017 , when u . s . president donald trump announced a decision to ban transgender people from serving in the u . s . military , claiming the military “ cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender [ people ] in the military would entail .” <PARA> at that time , multiple news articles reported the u . s . department of defense ( dod ) was spending far more on erectile dysfunction medication than it would cost to provide medical care to transgender service members . <PARA> the original sources for all these claims was a february 2015 military times article . that military times piece presented figures provided by the defense health agency ( dha ), a subsidiary of the department of defense , which documented that in 2014 : <PARA> we contacted the department of defense , which confirmed almost all of these figures were accurate for the year 2014 , with some slight corrections : the total number of prescriptions for erectile dysfunction medication was 1 , 178 , 423 , of which 905 , 683 were for viagra ; the total spent on cialis was $ 22 , 827 , 346 ; and the cost of prescriptions for active duty members was $ 7 . 68 million . the dod also clarified that the number of erectile dysfunction prescriptions given to active - duty members in 2014 was 140 , 789 , not 102 , 885 . <PARA> according to data posted on the public transparency tool usaspending . gov , the dod continues to purchase viagra . <PARA> attempts in both 2019 and 2017 to make political points by juxtaposing the controversy du jour with coverage for erectile dysfunction prescriptions for service members and their families don ’ t serve their causes well . for example , the department of defense does provide coverage for such prescriptions , but it also covers birth control . <PARA> in september 2014 , the armed forces health surveillance center published figures showing that the rate of erectile dysfunction diagnoses among active - component service members had doubled between 2004 and 2013 , and that 48 % of cases were psychogenic , meaning the erectile dysfunction was linked to mental health issues such as post - traumatic stress disorder and depression . <PARA> for context , we asked the dod for a cost breakdown of how much it spends on birth control , but we did not receive a response by the time of publication . we will update when further information becomes available .
false	in april 2013 a meme was spread on the internet that entering the coordinates 52 . 376552 , 5 . 198303 into google maps ( a location described in that application as being the beatrixpark in almere , netherlands ) and zooming in on the resulting satellite view would reveal an image of a man dragging a body into a lake ( leaving a bloody trail behind him ): <PARA> considering the full context of the image makes that claim rather improbable : it ’ s unlikely that someone would choose to dispose of a body in a public park in broad daylight , from a spot requiring that the body be lifted over a rail several feet high , while leaving an obvious trail of evidence behind him ( and potentially resulting in a conspicuous large splash and floating body ). <PARA> what the image actually appears to show is a couple of people accompanied by a dark brown dog ( perhaps a chocolate labrador ), and the supposed trail of blood is simply red - stained wood that has taken on a darker appearance due to being wetted ( possibly because the dog jumped into the surrounding water and then dripped it onto the wood ): <PARA> that explanation is borne out by a more comprehensive view of the area , which shows no bloody trail leading up to the wood itself : <PARA> the uk ’ s sun newspaper noted in an april 2013 article that “ local police have been sent the pic , but the photo was taken by google in 2009 , so there ’ s unlikely to be any evidence left to investigate .”
false	on 15 september 2016 , a facebook user shared a photograph of a mangled passenger vehicle and a tractor - trailer , claiming it represented an accident that involved a “ chevy suburban [ that ] jumped in front of this 18 wheeler at the last minute ” and killed everyone in those vehicles , including “ a 2 month old baby .” <PARA> but the previous day , a different user had shared the same photograph with a different comment : <PARA> local news sources reported that the depicted collision was not one caused by a vehicle that “ jumped in front of an 18 - wheeler ”; rather , it was part of a rapid chain reaction in which a tractor - trailer rear - ended another truck , and the second tractor - trailer then crushed the pickup truck in front of it . the two people who died in the crash ( the occupants of the pickup ) were adults aged 51 and 53 years , not children : <PARA> subsequent news reports suggested that the driver of the passenger vehicle ’ s only fault was that he happened to be on the road at the time the larger trucks collided . no accounts of the accident suggested the driver recklessly caused or contributed to the crash , and the crushed vehicle depicted in the crash photo was a pickup truck , not a chevy suburban : <PARA> on 15 september 2016 , the virality of the misrepresented photograph became its own news story , with one outlet reporting that : <PARA> however , it ’ s worth noting that none of the details shared about the “ chevy suburban ” photograph was accurate : two adults died in the depicted wreck ( no small child was killed ), and the deceased motorist did not cause the crash by driving unsafely . although reminders about safe driving are not themselves unseemly , using a photograph of an inaccurately described fatal accident to make an unrelated point treads that line ( as does the “ type rest in peace ” directive aimed solely at leveraging the tragedy for facebook engagement ). moreover , relatives of the people tragically killed were put at risk of unnecessary emotional distress by graphic images circulating facebook alongside grossly misconstrued claims inaccurately blaming the victims for their deaths .

false	in march 2019 , right - leaning and pro - life websites criticized the girl scouts of the usa in response to reports about a member in southern arizona who planned to achieve the organization ’ s “ gold award ” with a project about women ’ s reproductive health . <PARA> on 5 march , the website lifenews . com published an article with the headline “ girl scouts gives its highest award to teen who organized campaign promoting abortion ,” which continued : <PARA> the right - leaning website daily wire published an article with a headline that similarly claimed “ girl scouts give highest award to girl who organized a pro - abortion campaign .” <PARA> also , mygirlscoutcouncil . com , a pro - life website that publishes criticisms and concerns about the iconic civic group , posted to facebook , describing the controversy as follows : <PARA> “ a project to “ educate people about and destigmatize access to women ’ s healthcare ” earns girl scouts gold award , its highest award . completing this girl scout project for “ reproductive health justice ” began by joining the women ’ s march .” <PARA> “ in the last few years , meghna gopalan has found her voice . the 2016 election sparked her interest in civic engagement , and earlier this year she participated in march for our lives . then , while working on her girl scout gold award , the basis tucson north sophomore decided to speak up about women ’ s healthcare . now , she ’ s helping with media outreach for the tucson women ’ s march .” <PARA> of her gold award project , gopalan said : <PARA> “ i ’ m planning on hosting an event to educate people about and de - stigmatize access to women ’ s healthcare . i ’ ve been working with el rio reproductive health access project , and they offered ideas on reproductive health justice which would broaden the scope of the project a little bit .” <PARA> it ’ s true that a girl scout in arizona discussed in an interview her plans for a gold award project involving an event associated with “ women ’ s healthcare ” and “ reproductive health justice .” however , the claim that she achieved the gold award for ‘ promoting abortion ’ falls down on two grounds . <PARA> firstly , a spokesperson for the girl scouts of southern arizona clarified , in response to our questions , that as of 8 march 2019 , gopalan had not yet completed her gold award project , and therefore had not yet risen to the rank of “ gold award girl scout .” <PARA> secondly , after this fact check was originally published , a spokesperson for the girl scouts of southern arizona provided additional details and clarification about gopalan ’ s planned gold award project . <PARA> whereas previously there had been uncertainty over whether gopalan intended to promote access to abortion or present a pro - choice viewpoint , the spokesperson definitively clarified that gopalan ’ s project “ will not cover abortion in any way ,” and would focus instead on issues such as the hpv vaccine and domestic violence , and that it had never been her intention to examine the issue of abortion in her gold award project . <PARA> in a statement , the spokesperson wrote : <PARA> this means that the reports by lifenews . com and the daily wire were without factual basis not only because they inaccurately claimed that gopalan had already achieved the gold award ( when she had not ), but also because they had conflated “ women ’ s healthcare ” and “ reproductive health justice ” with abortion , when in fact , gopalan had never mentioned abortion in her interview and had never intended to address abortion in her project , but was focusing instead on some of the many other issues relating to women ’ s healthcare . <PARA> my girl scout council ’ s facebook post , which formed the basis of articles by lifenews . com and the daily wire , was also inaccurate in claiming that gopalan had already achieved the gold award . <PARA> in our original fact check , we signalled this as a possibility , pointing out that lifenews had inaccurately described “ access to women ’ s healthcare ” as a “ euphemism for abortion ,” whereas in reality women ’ s reproductive healthcare encompasses much more than merely abortion services and includes access to contraception and birth control , among other matters . <PARA> we also pointed out that the el rio reproductive health access project ( rhap ), the initiative with which gopalan said she had been working , is part of the tucson , arizona el rio health center , a federally - qualified health center that is legally barred from providing abortion services . <PARA> as a result , a spokesperson confirmed , the el rio rhap is also barred from providing abortion services and does not even give direct referrals for such services , instead focusing on sex education , contraception and birth control and sti testing . <PARA> although it was inaccurate to claim that gopalan ’ s planned project would give expression to a pro - choice viewpoint on abortion , it seems likely that the girl scouts organization would not object to such a gold award project . <PARA> we asked the girl scouts of southern arizona whether they encourage scouts to avoid certain topics or issues in their gold award projects . their answer strongly indicated that neither that girl scouts organization nor its guidelines would prove to be an obstacle if a girl scout proceeded with a project that promoted a pro - choice viewpoint on abortion : <PARA> “ regarding content : neither our staff nor our volunteer gold award committee determine the topics , causes , or issues that girls choose to address through their gold awards . at girl scouts , we don ’ t seek to censor girls or dictate to them what they must feel strongly about — and we support all girls regardless of their personal beliefs . instead , we seek to give girls the tools and skills to take action on any issue they choose . that ’ s what it means to be girl - led .” <PARA> following confirmation from the girl scouts of southern arizona that gopalan ’ s project “ will not cover abortion in any way ,” and that it had never been her intention to address that issue in her project , we have changed our rating from “ mixture ” to “ false ” in relation to the claim , reported by lifenews and the daily wire , that the girl scouts had given the gold award to a project which promoted abortion .
false	origins : given the prevalent public fear of governmental snooping into private activity , the discovery that personal computers were being sold with devices that enabled the department of homeland security ( dhs ) to monitor keystrokes would have a rather chilling effect . most of us now use computers in so many different facets of our lives , from personal correspondence to shopping , that recording and analyzing everything we typed on one would provide a great deal of information about us . <PARA> although furtive eavesdropping on computer activity is certainly possible , the specific tale presented above is nothing more than an example of “ government conspiracy ” type hoaxlore . it originally appeared on www . chromance . de ( from which it has since been removed , although it remains mirrored elsewhere ), a site which carried several other obvious hoaxes . the graphics for the article were lifted from another site ’ s page about commercial keyboard loggers , and the purported letter from the department of homeland security appears to be an altered version of someone else ’ s example of correspondence from the dhs .
false	niagara falls ( actually the collective name for a set of three waterfalls along the niagara river that forms the border between new york and ontario : the american falls , the bridal veil falls , and the canadian / horseshoe falls ) is the celebrated natural phenomenon that has awed generations of honeymooners . although it may seem astounding to contemplate , the tremendous volume of rushing water ( hundreds of thousands of gallons per second ) that is niagara falls does “ freeze ” from time to time , although very rarely “ completely ” as suggested in the text accompanying the following image — despite the abundance of ice visible in the image , water can still be seen flowing over the falls in several distinct streams : <PARA> as noted in the washington post , the sight of a “ frozen ” niagara falls is not so unusual a phenomenon : <PARA> during occasional periods of prolonged cold weather falling water and spray from niagara falls may freeze into ice formations , and ice mounds or floes may form in the niagara river ( sometimes creating ice bridges that stretch across the width of the river ), but only once in recorded history has freezing weather actually stopped water from flowing over the falls . this instance occurred in march 1848 when a preponderance of ice above the falls reduced the flow of water over the falls to a trickle , as reported in the buffalo express newspaper : <PARA> the sepia - toned photograph shown above ( which dates to about 1909 ) corresponds to a view of the american falls : <PARA> although the text that accompanies the sepia image in e - mail forwards and social media postings usually states that the photo dates from 1911 , other sources assign a variety of different dates to it . much of the niagara river around the falls was frozen in 1912 , an occurrence that resulted in a tragic accident when an ice bridge across the river broke free from its shoring as several people were traversing it . three people were unable to make it back to shore in time and were killed as the loosened ice plunged down the river . <PARA> in the wake of the january 2014 “ polar vortex ” that brought bitterly cold weather to much of the eastern half of the united states , a number of photographs were circulated via social media purporting to show niagara falls in a currently frozen state : <PARA> all of these images antedated the january 2014 polar vortex , however , having originated in 2007 , 2012 , and 2011 , respectively . ( the falls did ice over twice during the winter of 2014 , however .) <PARA> later versions of the example e - mail that was originally forwarded in 2007 included additional ( undated ) photographs of the falls in winter , obviously from different years ( from top left : 1906 , 1902 , and 1936 ):

false	origins : while we ’ re all aware of the need for heightened security since the events of september 11 , as well as the need for caution in disseminating information about the location and activities of u . s . military personnel as an invasion of iraq looms on the horizon , overzealousness can be just as harmful as laxity . unfortunately such was the case here , where a sloppy rush to sound an alert damaged the credibility of a legitimate organization providing a useful and valuable <PARA> service . <PARA> the north american center for emergency communications ( nacec ) was a non - profit , volunteer organization that operated a disaster victim information exchange system , intended to “ provide a centralized point for the high speed exchange of disaster victim and displaced person information , so organizations , agencies and family members can quickly locate and re - unite displaced families .” if , say , a hurricane struck a part of florida where your sister lived and you were unable to contact her afterwards , nacec was one of the organizations to which you might turn to help gather information on her status and whereabouts . the nacec also operated a military family flash mail service , intended to transmit messages from u . s . military forces serving overseas back to family and friends in the u . s . who lacked access to e - mail . <PARA> to nacec ’ s undeserved detriment , the warning quoted above was issued on the flimsiest of assumptions without even minimal attempts to verify nacec ’ s bona fides ( a very simple task which , as the nacec noted , “ a high school student could have accomplished in about 5 - 10 minutes by checking us out through the minnesota secretary of state ’ s web site or perhaps through their school or public library ”). a page about this misguided alert can be found on nacec ’ s web site , along with documents attesting to its validity and credibility . <PARA> nacec suspended all operations on 1 august 2006 . it has since become active again , but its focus appears to have changed somewhat . it now works “ to develop services that will help solve some of the problems caused by the communications segment of a damaged or overloaded infrastructure ,” which means it puts two - way radios into the hands of disaster relief workers in need of them .

unproven	in early october 2017 , a rumor surfaced online alleging that a person using only the name “ john ” on the messaging board 4chan had “ predicted ” the mass shooting in las vegas on 1 october 2017 . <PARA> police say a 64 - year - old gunman opened fire from the 32nd floor of the mandalay bay resort and casino on a crowd of 22 , 000 people gathered below for the route 91 harvest festival at 10 : 05 p . m . on 1 october . the attacker had modified a semi - automatic firearm so that it fired like an automatic , and for roughly ten minutes he sprayed the concert crowd with bullets , killing 58 people and wounding hundreds . <PARA> as with many mass casualty incidents in recent history , conspiracy theorists immediately pounced , claiming without proof , for example , that there was a second gunman on the fourth floor of the hotel or that internet sleuths had spotted footage of the shooter at an anti - trump rally . in keeping with this pattern , conspiracy - minded web sites neon nettle and worldtruth . tv posted identical stories claiming that an anonymous 4chan user predicted the las vegas strip massacre three weeks before it occurred . neonnettle reported : <PARA> the messages posted by “ john ” on either 10 september or 11 september 2017 ( depending where you look ) don ’ t in fact predict any specific catastrophe — he only said vaguely that some kind of incident would occur the following day in las vegas or henderson , and that a harbinger of this disaster will be “ three black vans parked next to either .” <PARA> according an alleged screen shot and archive of his comments , reposted to 4chan the day after the shooting ( with the thread title , “ anon ‘ jon ’ predicted vegas attack ”) the anonymous user issued the warning a day before the 16th anniversary of the 11 september terrorist attack , which could point to a troll trying to drum up fear as the anniversary approached . the user wrote : <PARA> although some 4chan users questioned whether the person who wrote the posts was the las vegas gunman , others didn ’ t seem impressed at all , saying the user had a habit of regularly posting vague predictions . as one person pointed out , “ make 1000 predictions a year and a couple will come true .” another 4chan user noted that the name “ john ” may reference john titor , a message board hoax from the early 2000s that depicted a time traveling soldier from the future who made bogus predictions about catastrophic events . <PARA> we don ’ t know who posted these messages , nor do we know whether the person who did so posts similar messages regularly . they gave the wrong date and didn ’ t refer to any specifics that would point to knowledge predicting the strip attack . the aspect of the prediction that was correct was the location , but even that was general . predictably both neon nettle and worldtruth . tv used the posts to support the claim that the attack was a “ false flag ” — a prevailing conspiracy theory that posits mass casualty incidents are engineered by the government to serve as pretense for heightened security and surveillance , and / or tighter gun control legislation .
false	following the 2018 u . s . midterm elections , in which democrats succeeded in taking back control of the u . s . house of representatives , pro - republican memesters tried to soften the blow by attempting to pass off the claim that “ every single one ” of the candidates former president barack obama had campaigned for lost their races : <PARA> while differing definitions of the term “ campaigned for ” could change this analysis somewhat , no reasonable definition of “ campaigned for ” would make the claim that “ every single person barack obama campaigned for lost ” accurate . <PARA> the strictest definition of “ campaigned for ” would mean obama ’ s appearing in person with the candidate in question at one or more campaign events . under this definition , the former president campaigned for numerous candidates who won their races . on 22 october 2018 , for example , barack obama appeared at a las vegas campaign rally with jacky rosen , who would go on to flip a senate seat in nevada from red to blue by beating incumbent republican dean heller : <PARA> as another example , on 5 november 2018 barack obama made a campaign appearance on behalf of virginia senate candidate tim kaine , who won his bid for reelection , and virginia house candidate jennifer wexton , who also won her race and flipped virginia ’ s 10th district from red to blue : <PARA> gubernatorial races were a different story . most notably , obama campaigned in georgia for stacey abrams , who has likely been defeated by brian kemp , and he campaigned for florida ’ s andrew gillum , who lost to ron desantis . <PARA> a broader definition of “ campaigned for ” would include candidates who received an endorsement from the former president . barack obama issued two waves of endorsements , first in august 2018 and then in october 2018 . in total , barack obama offered 342 endorsements for the 2018 midterm elections , with many of these endorsements resulting in substantive victories for democrats . <PARA> as an example , we will analyze the outcome of the endorsements obama made for congress . for the u . s . senate , obama endorsed five candidates : kyrsten sinema in arizona , senator bill nelson in florida , senator tina smith in minnesota , jacky rosen in nevada , and senator tammy baldwin in wisconsin . smith , rosen , and baldwin each won their respective races . <PARA> for the u . s . house of representatives , obama endorsed 69 candidates , including 20 of the 28 candidates responsible for snatching up gop - held seats and securing democratic control of the house : jennifer wexton ( va - 10 ), mary scanlon ( pa - 05 ), susan wild ( pa - 07 ), jason crow ( co - 06 ), debbie mucarsel - powell ( fl - 26 ), sharice davids ( ks - 03 ), dean phillips ( mn - 03 ), max rose ( ny - 11 ), chrissy houlahan ( pa - 06 ), colin allred ( tx - 32 ), sean casten ( il - 06 ), haley stevens ( mi - 11 ), antonio delgado ( ny - 19 ), lizzie pannill fletcher ( tx - 07 ), cindy axne ( ia - 03 ), abby finkenauer ( ia - 01 ), lauren underwood ( il - 14 ), tom malinowski ( nj - 07 ), angie craig ( mn - 02 ), and abigail spanberger ( va - 07 ). <PARA> in terms of endorsements , an analysis by the brookings institute found that president donald trump ’ s congressional picks underperformed relative to those of barack obama : <PARA> because multiple individuals with whom barack obama appeared with at campaign events did win their races , the claim that “ everyone ” obama campaigned for lost their races is self - evidently false .

true	american comedian and talk show host bill maher has a longstanding reputation for ruffling feathers with deliberately provocative statements , but in june 2018 he faced an especially clamorous backlash for remarks he allegedly made about president donald trump and the global economy . <PARA> the comments were quoted ad nauseam by social media users who heaped scorn on the talk show host , whom they apparently regard as a standard - bearer of progressive thought : <PARA> a few snopes readers wrote to ask if we could confirm that maher actually said these words . the plethora of clips shared on youtube , twitter , and facebook left little doubt that the quote was authentic . here is one example : <PARA> a longer clip shows the context in which he uttered the remarks . it was during a panel discussion in the 8 june 2018 episode of real time with bill maher in which the host himself brought up the subject of america ’ s economic health , acknowledging that it was doing “ pretty well ” before he veered off on an unexpected tangent : <PARA> on one level , maher ’ s remarks do ring “ cruel and callous ” ( as cnn commentator dean obeidallah put it ), especially coming from a wealthy entertainer who , unlike most americans , has the resources to shield himself from a serious economic downturn . <PARA> but it ’ s an oversimplification to claim that maher is rooting for a recession just because he hates trump , or wants to see him take the blame for americans ’ suffering . for one thing , maher clearly thinks the recession he is prepared to root for is inevitable (“ i feel like the bottom has to fall out ,” he said ). for another , he believes trump ’ s overall agenda threatens democracy itself (“... it ’ s either root for a recession or you lose your democracy ”). <PARA> agree with him or not , maher was making a larger point not dissimilar to the one conservative pundit rush limbaugh made in 2009 when he said “ i hope obama fails .” <PARA> never mind that one of obama ’ s first tasks as president would be trying to repair the already - damaged economy and prevent the united states from sinking deeper into recession . like maher ’ s , limbaugh ’ s overriding concern was defeating the new president ’ s overall agenda , which — again like maher — he characterized as a threat to the country . <PARA> “ i know what his politics are ,” limbaugh said . “ i know what his plans are , as he has stated them . i don ’ t want them to succeed .” <PARA> this kind of talk isn ’ t restricted to one party or ideology . it ’ s endemic to modern american politics .
true	in january 2019 readers contacted us looking for confirmation that dc comics will feature the biblical figure jesus christ in a different light . <PARA> the series second coming , written by author mark russell with art by richard pace , does indeed exist . but while dc is publishing it , the book will be a part of their vertigo line , which is geared toward more mature readers . the first issue will be released on 6 march 2019 . <PARA> the series ’ official synopsis describes it as a work in which “ god sends jesus to earth in hopes that he will learn the family trade from sun - man , an all - powerful super hero , who is like the varsity quarterback son god never had . but , upon his return to earth , christ is appalled to discover what has become of his gospel and vows to set the record right .” <PARA> as is the case with most vertigo titles , the book will not show jesus interacting with mainstream superheroes such as superman or batman . instead , russell said in an interview published in august 2018 , jesus will find himself rooming with sun - man : <PARA> russell , whose prior works apocraphya now and god is disappointed in you also dealt with biblical subject matter , said that because his version of jesus is being released from imprisonment , he has no idea how his teachings have been interpreted on earth . <PARA> “ they have him more as mascot on t - shirts to prove they ’ re on the winning team ,” he said . “[ second coming ] is about jesus coming down and being appalled by what he sees has been done in his name by christianity in the last two thousand years .” <PARA> the pop culture site bleeding cool , which published the interview with russell , also reported on 9 january 2019 that his series had begun getting attention from religiously oriented and conservative news outlets including the christian broadcasting network ( which called russell ’ s take on the jesus character “ closer to blasphemous than biblical ”) and fox news , among others , attributing the spread of the story to an op - ed published on the comic books news site comic book resources earlier that month . <PARA> bleeding cool also noted that in 1989 , dc comics refused to publish an issue of the vertigo title swamp thing that would have depicted a meeting between jesus and the titular character . between 1995 and 2000 , vertigo published the series preacher , a comic that dealt with a human preacher , jesse custer , on a self - appointed mission to find god ( depicted as a glowing human figure ) and hold him accountable for escaping from heaven . the series has since been adapted for television . <PARA> dc comics did not comment on the online criticism concerning the release of second coming .
true	the photograph of an injured cat displayed above was posted to facebook on 21 january 2014 by julie muzynoski miklaszewicz , who reported that it showed burns sustained by an “ office kitty ” named dewey after he knocked over a cinnamon reed diffuser ( a reed diffuser is a glass bottle that holds a fragrant liquid ; reeds are inserted into the bottle which absorb the formula and diffuse its scent into the surrounding air ): <PARA> ok , folks ... this picture is going to be a bit disturbing , but i think the word needs to get out there . this is our “ office kitty ,” dewey . he knocked over a cinnamon reed diffuser ( you know , those things with liquid and sticks in them to make the room smell good ). he was washed up quickly , and we thought he was ok . turns out he was not . dewey has chemical burns over a good portion of his belly and hind legs from the liquid in the reed diffuser . he spent five days at the vet having his wounds debrided . they had to put him under anesthesia to do this , because it would have been too painful otherwise . this is what some of his wounds look like after he was treated at the vet — there is more on his belly and on his other leg , and this actually looks good compared to what it looked like when he was taken to the vet . the burns did not show up for about a week or two , and we thought he was ok and was just “ stained ” from the liquid . that was not the case . dewey will be ok , in time . but , what if this had been a child ? what if those chemicals had spilled on a child ’ s face or in their eyes ? you wouldn ’ t think the “ stuff ” in a reed diffuser would cause such horrific burns , but obviously this one did . <PARA> this is not a joke . please share this with your friends . i would hate to have something like this happen to a child . it ’ s bad enough it happened to an animal . if you have children or animals , get rid of your reed diffusers ! this is not something i ’ m just forwarding to you , so you won ’ t find anything about this on snopes ( unless they contact me !). i ’ m signing my name , so you know this is really from me , because i don ’ t want folks to think this is just one of those “ things ” that spreads around the internet . <PARA> julie told us that ( as of 31 january 2014 ) dewey was receiving very good care and lots of extra loving and was recuperating nicely . <PARA> last updated : 9 january 2018

true	if there were a prize for the most abused social security number , 078 - 05 - 1120 would win it hands down . what started out as an ordinary number originally issued to a middle - aged secretary in new york state was at the height of its popularity claimed by more than 40 , 000 people . <PARA> it ’ s hard to now imagine a time without social security numbers because they ’ ve grown to be so much a part of everyone ’ s identity . yet indeed there was a time when what we now take for granted was brand - spanking new . the first ssns were issued in november 1936 , and by the end of 1937 , about 37 , 139 , 000 of them had been handed out . even so , they were still very much the new thing and not at all understood . which set the stage for what was about to happen . <PARA> in 1938 , the wallet manufacturer e . h . ferree of lockport , new york , decided they could better promote their wares by showing how the new social security card would look in their wallets . a sample card , meant strictly for display purposes , was inserted into each wallet , the number appearing on the card belonging to mrs . hilda schrader whitcher , secretary to e . h . ferree vice president and treasurer douglas patterson . <PARA> although the card distributed in those wallets ( sold through woolworth stores and other department stores all over the u . s .) was half the size of the real thing , was printed all in red , and had the word “ specimen ” stamped across the face of it , thousands of those who purchased wallets containing the specimen card adopted its number as their own . in the peak year of 1943 , a reported 5 , 755 people were using hilda ’ s number — fathers passed it on to sons and mothers to daughters , keeping it alive for decades . <PARA> in an effort to curb the abuse , the social security administration voided the “ woolworth ” number ( they gave hilda a new one ) and did what they could to publicize that people should not use it , but the number continued to turn up as late as 1977 , when twelve people were found to still be using the ssn “ issued by woolworth .” ( the previous year , forty people had that notion , so at least things were getting better .) in all , over 40 , 000 people have reported the woolworth number as their own throughout the years . <PARA> there have been other cases in which numbers on mock social security cards have been preempted for widespread use , although none on the scale of the abuse of 078 - 05 - 1120 . one embarrassing episode was the fault of the social security board itself : in 1940 , the board published a pamphlet explaining the new social security program which featured an illustration of a social security card on its cover . the card pictured on the pamphlet bore the non - assigned number 219 - 09 - 9999 , and , as one might inevitably expect , in 1962 a woman presented herself to the provo , utah , social security office complaining that her new employer would not accept her ssn : 219 - 09 - 9999 . when the disgruntled woman was informed that the ssn she had proffered was invalid and could not possibly belong to her , she pulled out her copy of the 1940 pamphlet to prove that 219 - 09 - 9999 was in fact the number that had been assigned to her .
unproven	racial discrepancies in criminal sentencing are a long - standing concern in the united states and a common feature of online debate and social media memes , as we have examined on several occasions . <PARA> in the summer of 2018 another set of cases formed the basis of a viral post published by the left - leaning facebook page “ the other 98 %.” the 1 june meme showed a photograph of black teenager dayonn davis and details of his conviction and sentencing , side by side with a photograph of lyle burgess along with details of his punishment : <PARA> next to the meme , “ the other 98 %” added “ this is why they kneel ,” a reference to ongoing protests by national football league players against racial injustice , which involve kneeling or not taking to the field while the the national anthem is played before games : <PARA> in support of the claims contained within the meme , “ the other 98 %” cited two sources . the first was a june 2018 article published by the root , which reported that : <PARA> the second source was a may 2018 article by the huffington post , which reported that : <PARA> dayonn davis <PARA> according to muscogee county court records , on 29 may 2018 dayonn davis was given a 15 - year sentence after pleading guilty to robbery by force . the 18 - year - old was ordered to serve five years in prison and the remaining 10 years on probation . <PARA> because he had no prior convictions , davis was sentenced under the state of georgia ’ s first offender act , meaning that his felony conviction would be removed from his criminal record if he fulfilled all the requirements of his custodial sentence and probation . <PARA> according to the state ’ s case against him , davis arranged to buy a pair of nike air jordan ‘ oreo ’ shoes from a young man named carlton anthony jr ., in columbus , georgia , in january 2016 , when davis was 15 years old : <PARA> under georgia ’ s 1994 juvenile justice reform act , minors charged with one of seven serious felonies are tried as adults . such was the case with davis , who was originally charged with armed robbery and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony . <PARA> davis claimed not to have known that his accomplice would bring a gun to the robbery , but facing a mandatory minimum prison sentence of 10 years without parole , he entered into an agreement with prosecutors whereby he pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of “ robbery by force ” and instead received a five - year prison sentence with the possibility of parole . <PARA> even so , the punishment garnered local and national news coverage and was clearly viewed as harsh by some , given that davis was 15 years old at the time of the offence , had no prior juvenile record , and the items taken in the robbery were of relatively low monetary value . <PARA> speaking to the national public radio affiliate wabe , his attorney susan henderson said : “ he really is a good kid that made a really dumb , 15 - year - old mistake ... he owns up to the fact that he made a mistake .” <PARA> however , muscogee county district attorney sadhana dailey rejected claims that davis ’ punishment was excessive . in a statement sent to abc news affiliate wtvm , dailey wrote : <PARA> it ’ s not clear whether davis was on the honor roll at kendrick high school , as the other 98 % meme claimed , but henderson certainly averred in court that he had been receiving a and b grades before his arrest in 2016 ( although she said his grades had dropped since then ), according to the ledger - enquirer . <PARA> as of 28 september 2018 , davis remained incarcerated in the muscogee county jail . <PARA> lyle burgess <PARA> according to san joaquin county court records , on 23 may 2018 lyle burgess was sentenced to 90 days ’ detention and five years probation for violating section 261 . 5 ( c ) of california ’ s penal code , a statutory rape law which states that “ any person who engages in an act of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor who is more than three years younger than the perpetrator is guilty of either a misdemeanor or a felony ...” <PARA> burgess , who was 79 years old at the time of his sentencing , had entered a “ no contest ” plea in connection with his violation . he was initially charged with “ continuous sexual abuse of a child ,” a serious felony which carries a sentence of between six and 16 years in state prison , after the parents of a then five - year - old girl accused him of touching her private parts repeatedly between october 2015 and november 2016 . that charge was later replaced with four counts of “ lewd acts upon a child ” ( sec . 288a of california ’ s penal code ). <PARA> burgess pleaded not guilty to all four counts , and his attorneys requested that san joaquin county superior court judge michael mulvihill dismiss the charges , arguing that not enough evidence established that burgess had touched the girl with “ the intent of arousing , appealing to , or gratifying the lust , passions , or sexual desires of that person or the child .” <PARA> burgess ’ attorneys also maintained that both the young girl and her mother had been inconsistent in their accounts of the molestation . ( the details of the case might be disturbing to some readers , and we have redacted certain names from court records as a precaution against identifying the victim .) <PARA> the prosecution , led by san joaquin county district attorney tori verber salazar and deputy district attorney kathleen murray , urged mulvihill to reject the motion to dismiss , arguing that no innocent explanation covered burgess ’ touching the girl in her private parts and alleging that , when he was confronted by her parents , burgess had admitted to touching the child and offered to give them money if they did not bring charges against him . in the end , judge mulvihill sided with the prosecution and rejected burgess ’ motion to dismiss the charges against him . <PARA> the trial was scheduled to begin on 20 april 2018 , but two days before that , burgess entered a plea agreement with the prosecution . under the deal , the state dropped the four counts of “ lewd acts upon a child ” ( which carried a possible sentence of six to 16 years ), and burgess pleaded no contest to “ unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor who is more than three years younger ,” a statutory rape charge which carried a sentence of no more than one year in county jail . <PARA> on 23 may , judge ronald northup sentenced burgess to 90 days in county jail but recommended home detention ( i . e . “ house arrest ,” as the meme stated ). burgess was given five years of probation with the conditions that he not make any contact with his victim , hand over any firearms he may own , not break any laws , submit himself and his property to searches , and stay away from parks , schools , and “ areas where children frequent .” <PARA> burgess was not ordered to register as a sex offender , despite that course of action ’ s being available as one of the possible conditions of his five - year probation . <PARA> burgess ’ punishment was greeted with widespread outrage . ken meleyco , a lawyer for the victim ’ s family , told sacramento television station ktxl that : <PARA> in response to the criticism , san joaquin county issued a press release explaining that burgess ’ sentence was the result of a negotiated settlement worked out with all parties involved ( including the victim ’ s family ), taking into account the mitigating factors that the child victim was not “ sexually penetrated ” and the perpetrator was elderly and in frail health : <PARA> conclusion <PARA> on the whole , the factual claims contained in the other 98 % meme were accurate but left out certain salient details . dayonn davis was 15 years old and reportedly a good student at the time of his offense , which was indeed his first . however , he did not merely “ steal sneakers ”; he engaged in an armed robbery in which an accomplice helped him steal shoes from another teenager at gunpoint . <PARA> davis was tried as an adult — georgia law requires that course of action for any minor charged with armed robber — and he was indeed sentenced to five years in prison . but the meme left out the fact that his sentence , although it appeared harsh to many observers , was the result of a plea agreement with prosecutors and was lower than the 10 - year minimum sentence he could have faced if he had been convicted of armed robbery ( as opposed to robbery by force ). <PARA> the meme ’ s presentation of lyle burgess ’ conviction was more complete . burgess was indeed 79 years old at the time of his sentencing , and he was convicted under a statutory rape law for molesting a five - year - old girl . the maximum sentence available to the judge in burgess ’ case was 12 months in county jail , but he instead gave burgess five years ’ probation and 90 days detention , recommending that burgess serve his sentence under house arrest and not be required to register as a sex offender . <PARA> but the notion that these two cases demonstrate disparities in sentencing due to race ( or any other factor ) is extremely problematic because they were so disparate and involved so many different variables other than race . one case took place in georgia , the other in california . one case involved a 15 - year - old high schooler as a defendant , the other a 79 - year - old man in declining health . one case involved the use of a weapon , the other did not . one case was about an armed robbery , the other about sexual molestation . moreover , the sentences in both cases were primarily established through negotiated plea deals and not merely the fiat of judges .
mixture	in mid - april 2019 , a dated story from the daily caller website began circulating on social media for unclear reasons . the story , originally published on 24 october 2016 , bore the headline , “ leaked : obama team kept list of muslims for top jobs , excluded non - muslims .” <PARA> the story is based on the contents of a stolen email leaked by document - dumping platform wikileaks . it was part of a now - infamous trove of democratic national committee ( dnc ) messages that were hacked and spilled online in the lead - up to the 2016 presidential election . the daily caller in 2016 reported : <PARA> it is both true and unsurprising that per the leaked email , dated 17 october 2008 , non - muslims were excluded from a list of potential muslim candidates to be considered for obama administration posts . what the daily caller story failed to elucidate is whether lists of candidates from other demographic groups were compiled to promote general diversity in the obama administration ’ s ranks . because agency heads during obama ’ s presidency came from various backgrounds , it ’ s safe to say non - muslims were not “ excluded ” from consideration for top posts . <PARA> many took to social media in spring of 2019 to suggest that the information was both new , and that the effort to hire muslim people to administration cabinet positions was somehow nefarious . <PARA> as noted earlier , the story is not new and lacks key context . <PARA> it was published roughly two weeks before the november 2016 election and was itself based on a document that at the time was eight years old . the email was forwarded to podesta , who at the time served as co - chair of president - elect obama ’ s transition team , from gayle smith , who worked in the white house under both obama and president bill clinton . the forwarded message included commentary on a list of potential candidates compiled by attorney and former obama administration official preeta bansal to be considered for “ top administration jobs , sub - cabinet jobs , and outside boards / agencies / policy committees .” <PARA> the desire for a cabinet that contains demographic representation reflecting the american populace isn ’ t unique to the obama administration . in 2000 , nbc news reported on similar aspirations by obama ’ s predecessor , then - president - elect george w . bush . “ people that work hard and make the right decisions in life can achieve anything they want in america ,” bush is quoted as saying at the time . <PARA> bush went on to select colin powell and condoleezza rice to serve as consecutive secretaries of state . they were the first african - american man and woman to hold that high - ranking post . <PARA> the old daily caller story about the wikileaks document may have gained sudden online momentum because the organization ’ s founder , julian assange , has been in the news . he was arrested in london on 11 april 2019 and faces extradition to the u . s . on charges that he conspired to hack a pentagon computer in 2010 . assange , who initially faced extradition to sweden where he was accused of sexual assault , has been holed up in the ecuadorian embassy in britain for seven years to avoid arrest , long fearing extradition to the united states . <PARA> but the ecuadorian government , citing a string of alleged grievances from discourteous behavior to using its property for international espionage , evicted assange and suspended the citizenship it bestowed upon him , making his arrest possible and bringing the long saga to an end . <PARA> wikileaks played a key role in the morass of disinformation that flooded cyberspace in the 2016 election cycle , both pumping out troves of emails stolen from the dnc by russian hackers and fanning the flames of a false conspiracy theory that alleged murdered dnc staffer seth rich , not russian operatives , hacked the dnc . <PARA> because wikileaks activities vis - a - vis the election harmed the efforts of president donald trump ’ s opponent hillary clinton , trump and some of his supporters professed their support for the organization . after assange ’ s arrest , however , some prominent supporters , including trump , have backed away , with the president stating , “ i know nothing about wikileaks . it ’ s not my thing ... it ’ s not my deal in life .”
mixture	a long - circulated collection of purported money - saving tips for buying gasoline includes some items whose veracity is disputed , and others whose purported economic gains are highly questionable : <PARA> below is a summary of what we ’ ve gleaned from various sources about the usefulness of these tips : <PARA> the temperature at which gasoline is sold has been the focus of legislative interest of late in several states , the primary issue being that regulators maintain gasoline expands or contracts about 1 % for every 15 - degree change in the fuel ’ s temperature . u . s . oil companies and distributors account for temperature when they sell to each other , but most retail outlets in the u . s . ( i . e ., gas stations that service ordinary motorists ) make no such adjustments . the standard used in the oil industry assumes fuel is dispensed at a temperature of 60 ° f ; however , fuel often comes out of service station pumps at considerably higher temperatures ( especially in warmer climates ), but its volume is still calculated as if it were 60 ° f , which advocates claim results in customers ’ getting a smaller volume of gasoline than they ’ re paying for . lawmakers in some states ( such as california , texas , and missouri ) have therefore been considering bills that would force retailers to add temperature - adjusting pumps ( automatic temperature compensation , or atc ) in order to bring the gallons - sold tally in line with the 60 ° f standard . <PARA> ( temperature regulations on gasoline sales are already in effect in some places . hawaii , for example , requires retail pumps to dispense fuel on the assumption that it is 80 ° f rather than 60 ° f . atc is widely used in canada , but some critics have noted that canada ’ s colder climate means gasoline is often dispensed at temperatures lower than 60 ° f , resulting in customers ’ getting more than they ’ re paying for — hence the oil industry ’ s eagerness to embrace atc in that country while resisting its implementation in the u . s .) <PARA> the whole temperature / volume issue is a subject of lively debate : some maintain that consumers always get the volume of gas they pay for , regardless of temperature , and the real issue is whether a gallon of warmer , expanded fuel contains as much “ energy ” as a gallon of cooler fuel . some say it doesn ’ t ; others maintain that consumers are getting the same “ energy content ” in a tank of gas either way . <PARA> moreover , according to some sources the idea that buying gasoline in the morning will guarantee motorists get considerably cooler ( and therefore cheaper ) fuel is a chimera , as the los angeles times noted : <PARA> others maintain that regardless of the temperature at which gasoline is delivered , due to the insulative properties of underground storage tanks one can ’ t be sure that gasoline will always be at its coolest early in the morning . <PARA> in any case , the bottom line is whether it ’ s really worthwhile for consumers ( in the absence of atc ) to take matters into their own hands and attempt to save money by buying gasoline only at a particular time of day . even if the temperature / volume issue were a real and significant one , one has to consider the amount of savings to be gleaned from such a scheme . assuming that a motorist typically bought 15 gallons of gasoline per week at $ 4 . 00 per gallon , and assuming that by carefully choosing to fill up at a particular time of day said consumer could realize a 1 % savings , we calculate the total savings to be gleaned over the course of a year at about $ 31 . would that reward really be worth the potential inconvenience of adhering to a rigid fill - up schedule week after week ? <PARA> most sources agree that deliveries from tanker trucks do stir up particles of dirt and sludge in gasoline storage tanks , but that this isn ’ t really much of an issue for the ordinary motorist . gas stations are required to have filters that trap dirt and sludge , and modern automobiles also have fuel filters , so a bit of stirred - up dirt doesn ’ t really pose much potential to adversely affect your car . <PARA> and again , one has to consider the trade - off . on the ( probably infrequent ) occasions when you arrive at a gas station at the very same time a tanker is filling the station ’ s tanks , is it really worth the time and expense to leave without filling up and drive off to a different service station just to avoid something that likely isn ’ t much of a concern in the first place ? <PARA> we haven ’ t found much of a consensus about whether gasoline evaporating from automobile gas tanks is truly “ lost ,” whether the amount of ( hypothetical ) loss is significant or negligible , or how much the evaporation rate would really be lessened by motorists ’ driving with gas tanks never less than half full . nonetheless , we can still make some rough economic estimates about the purported advantages of this tip . <PARA> some advanced gasoline filtration systems claim to recover about 2 % of the fuel lost by evaporation from gas station storage tanks , so we ’ ll use that figure as a baseline for argument ’ s sake . ( yes , we realize that underground storage tanks and automobile gas tanks are two very different things .) in the scenario outlined for tip # 1 above , our typical consumer might save about $ 62 per year on gasoline if he could completely eliminate losses due to evaporation from his automobile ’ s gas tank ( and this tip only addresses reducing evaporation , not eliminating it ). <PARA> is that savings really worth essentially halving the storage capacity of your car ’ s gas tank ( thereby requiring you to stop for gasoline twice as often as before )? assuming that our typical consumer bought gasoline once a week , and that the fill - up process averaged a modest 8 minutes ( including the time to get to a gas station , to wait in line if the pumps are all busy , to pump the gas , to pay for the purchase , and to get back on the road ), said consumer would be spending an extra 7 hours per year pumping gas to achieve these savings . is that a good trade - off of time vs . money ? <PARA> the primary claim here is that service station pumps in some places use nozzles fitted with vapor recovery systems , but those systems recover and recycle vapors produced during the process of dispensing gasoline which the consumer has already paid for . ( that is , the pumps do not adjust price or volume to reflect vapor recovery , so the consumer is essentially paying for losses due to “ waste ” even though the retailer is recouping those losses through a recycling process .) <PARA> the efficacy of this tip is another issue of dispute . advocates maintain that pumping gas more slowly produces fewer vapors , and therefore consumers get more for their money by using slower settings on pumps ( because less gasoline is lost to vaporization ). critics ( including state regulators ) assert that the amount of vapor loss produced during the pumping process is so small as to be economically insignificant to the ordinary consumer . and , as in the tip # 3 above , one has to consider the time factor : is the aggregate amount of time you ’ re going to lose by using only the slowest delivery setting at every fill - up really worth whatever modest amount of money you might save ? <PARA> the bottom line is that there are much easier and better ways of improving the efficiency of your car ( and thus of saving you money at the pump ) than the tips outlined above . particularly important is proper maintenance , including engine tune - ups , wheel alignments , tire pressure checks , and filter replacement . mileage can also be improved by removing from the car little - used equipment that adds weight or increases drag ( e . g ., sporting gear , tools , roof racks / carriers ). driving habits are especially important : jackrabbit stops and starts eat up extra fuel , as does driving at higher speeds . all in all , the simple habit of engaging in planning and combining multiple trips into one excursion will likely save the average motorist far more money ( and time ) than all four of the above tips combined .
false	which single movie has had the greatest influence , in both artistic and economic terms , on the film industry ? anyone born in the last half century or so might venture that the ongoing massive appeal of the star wars universe means that film should claim the crown . many cinema buffs would argue that elements of orson welles ’ citizen kane can be found in virtually every film that followed it . fans of casablanca would likely point out that it is probably the most - referenced movie of all time . yet the winner of that honor , according to a 2018 study , is the beloved 1939 mgm musical the wizard of oz . <PARA> one of the most iconic moments in that most iconic of films was judy garland ’ s rendition of the song “ over the rainbow ,” a ballad that resonated with depression - era audiences for its expression of dorothy gale ’ s yearning wish to be somewhere better , somewhere other than the current bleak landscape . and ironically , that magic moment almost didn ’ t make it into the final version of the movie : <PARA> originally popularized by judy garland ’ s rendition in the film , the standard received new attention when it was covered in 1993 by hawaiian artist israel kamakawiwoʻole ( as “ somewhere over the rainbow ”). by 2014 , “ over the rainbow ,” penned in 1938 by yip harburg , had become became attached to a new legend : that its lyrics were about the jewish experience during the pattern of suppression , oppression , and violence that comprised the holocaust : <PARA> in some versions of the rumor , a holocaust survivor wrote the words during the events of world war ii — even though the wizard of oz debuted before the start of the war , and harburg was not a holocaust survivor . ( he spent the 1940s writing music in hollywood .) <PARA> in december 2014 , rabbi bernhard rosenberg published an editorial about the song “ from a jewish perspective ” which began by establishing some context for his subsequent musings : <PARA> portions of rosenberg ’ s column were pasted into e - mail forwards claiming that the song was about the holocaust , but his actual published words contradicted that claim ( albeit subtly ): <PARA> rabbi rosenberg ’ s words indicated that his perspective was one of looking back at the song through the lens of historical events , not that he was suggesting those events inspired the song itself . <PARA> in 2004 , democracy now profiled yip harburg and interviewed his son ernie harburg . the segment included an archival interview featuring the elder harburg ( who died in 1981 ) discussing the manner in which “ over the rainbow ” was written for the wizard of oz . although the interview addressed broader political themes in harburg ’ s body of work , neither the holocaust nor world war ii was cited as inspiration for the song . one passage quoted yip harburg on how he worked out the song ’ s lyrics as harold arlen wrestled with composing the music for the classic tune : <PARA> although the song “ over the rainbow ” may be have come to be retrospectively viewed as a message of hope and resilience contemporaneous with the holocaust period , no evidence supports that the song was written with the horrors to come in mind . neither the outspoken yip harburg nor his son ernie indicated that the song had any connection to the holocaust , even as they analyzed the political meanings of yip ’ s works years after they first emerged on screen and stage .

false	online disinformation targeting former president barack obama and first lady michelle obama did not end after their departure from the white house in january 2017 . <PARA> in may 2018 , the right - wing , pro - trump “ deplorables ” facebook page posted a viral meme which attempted to contrast the readiness of first lady melania trump to make patriotic gestures , with that of her predecessor . over a photograph of trump placing her hand on her heart , the meme reads : “ the one thing michelle obama never did ...” <PARA> this photograph of melania trump was taken during the official visit to washington d . c . of french president emmanuel macron and his wife brigitte on 24 april 2018 . it shows the first lady placing her hand over her heart as the united states ’ national anthem played : <PARA> there is ample photographic and video evidence clearly showing the former first lady doing the same , exactly as she is accused of “ never ” having done in the “ deplorables ” meme . a quick browse of the archives of major photography agencies like getty and the associated press shows that this was a gesture obama made routinely in her official public duties . c - span ‘ s archive contains multiple video clips of barack and michelle obama both honoring the anthem by placing their hands over their hearts . <PARA> so the claim that michelle obama as first lady never placed her hand over her heart in honor of the national anthem is wildly , demonstrably false . <PARA> critics of obama targeted the 44th president and the first lady throughout both obama administrations , falsely accusing the couple of disrespecting both the u . s . flag and national anthem , either through ignorance of etiquette or a lack of patriotism . the may 2018 “ deplorables ” meme is just the latest example of such outrageous and easily - disproven disinformation .
unproven	jim carrey may be best known for his acting and comedic timing , but he has started to receive attention for a new creative passion — painting . carrey released a series of artworks in march 2018 that were highly critical of united states president donald trump and his administration : <PARA> shortly thereafter , a meme was posted to the “ impeach donald trump ” facebook page which carried a quote attributed to the actor , presumably using his political art as inspiration : <PARA> the meme was not accompanied by any information about where and when carrey allegedly said this ( a trait that many misattributed or hoax quotes have in common ), which makes it especially difficult to verify . we ’ ve searched carrey ’ s social media posts , news articles , and interviews but have found no evidence of him saying this . <PARA> in fact , we couldn ’ t find any record of this quote at all that predates the 23 march 2018 posting of this meme . as such , it appears that this “ morally upside down ” phrasing originated with the meme maker , not with jim carrey .

false	on november 12 2016 , the alternative medicine website - turned - conspiracy - hub natural news published a pseudo - scientific rant by editor and founder mike adams ( aka the “ health ranger ”) arguing and celebrating the fact that liberal millennials ( whom he calls “ crybully snowflakes ”) are not biologically fit and therefore not likely to survive the next “ natural selection event ”: <PARA> for anyone wondering what a “ natural selection event ” might be , this is what adams suggested : <PARA> adams ’ piece , titled “ trigger warning : why precious college snowflakes will eliminate themselves from the human gene pool at the next natural selection event ”, is flawed for myriad reasons , most notably its repeated use of strawman arguments and conspicuous lack of citable evidence . in this article , however , we will dissect the health ranger ’ s argument strictly based on his flawed understanding of natural selection . to begin with , here is how he describes the characteristics of the two populations whose biological fitness he claims to be comparing : <PARA> discounting the aggressively broad generalizations of both sides , we ’ ll turn to the science supposedly expressed here . what follows is adams ’ understanding of natural selection : <PARA> in his view of natural selection , which , we will grant , is close to ( but falls short of ) being accurate , the process results in millennial snowflake liberals who are less fit because they don ’ t possess the following traits that “ are universal across the natural world ”: <PARA> the issue , though , is that these three traits are far from universal in the natural world . on his first point , we can obviously agree with adams that competition is a key part of natural selection . but do populations of organisms feature ruthless competition between members ? no . <PARA> in what could easily be branded as an example of the natural world ’ s version of the liberal welfare state , skilled vampire bat predators will give nourishment , unreciprocated , to those less able to feed themselves . a 2013 paper published by proceedings of the royal society documented this behavior over a two - year period , finding that donors who offered the food to the recipients without prompting , and that this action occurred independent of kinship . the phenomenon is important , the authors argue , because : <PARA> adams ’ second point about the need to be “ adaptive ” to one ’ s environment results from a flawed reading of darwin . when proposing his theory of natural selection , adams repeatedly suggests : <PARA> adaptations are , of course , a big part of natural selection , but what darwin was referring to in this case were genetically determined features of an organism , set at birth , that would give it a reproductive advantage — not the specific characteristic “ adaptability ” to rapidly changing environments , as darwin stated in on the origin of species : <PARA> adams ’ third point is a common rallying cry among those who argue that a patriarchal society is the only social structure existing in the natural world . the problem , of course , is that there are myriad animals , including primates , that live in female - dominant social structures all around the natural world . a small selection of those animals are listed in a 2008 study published in the journal animal behavior : <PARA> outside of those primary claims , adams make some even more inflammatory , and equally illogical , scientific claims . for example , he believes that liberal female college students don ’ t need to be selective in their choice of mates because of their easy access to abortions : <PARA> if anything , the opposite is true . abortion rates and unplanned pregnancies have been declining since the reagan administration of the 1980s , a fact researchers attribute to contraception , something college students generally have better access to than the population at large . this would put females explicitly in charge of whom they would want to have procreative sex with , making them ( from an evolutionary standpoint ) more selective . <PARA> another specious notion is the concept of a “ natural selection event .” this is not a thing . natural selection happens all the time , a point explicitly and poetically made by darwin : <PARA> the final and perhaps most alarming issue with adams ’ conception of natural selection is his omission of the fact that any trait selected for has to be heritable , which means it is controlled by genetics and is able to be passed on through reproduction . <PARA> while there there is some evidence from studies that genetic differences can be found between people of different ideological persuasions , these studies are limited in their ability to tell us much about what specific aspects of ideology are hereditary . <PARA> a 2012 review article on this topic by peter k . hatemi and rose mcdermott published in trends in genetics concluded that genetics may account for a significant portion of political persuasion , but that the manner in which genetics controlled specific issues was not consistent ( i . e ., some issues appeared to be more genetically determined than others ) and played a much smaller role in actually determining political party affiliation . the study also pushed back against the simplistic notion that there is a “ liberal ” gene and a “ conservative ” gene : <PARA> for adams ’ argument to work , he would have to find evidence that all or most of the traits he ascribes to the snowflakes and the conservatives are hereditary . it is unlikely that he would be able to find studies addressing the genetic basis of qualities like being “ pathetic ” and “ pussified ”, “ metrosexual ”, having an “ everybody ’ s a winner ” or “ real - world ” mentality , or having the desire for “ feel good social conformity ”. <PARA> arguably , adams actually delves into the discredited and archaic theory of lamarckism , which suggests that an organism can pass on characteristics that it has acquired during its lifetime to its offspring when he claims that parents inflicting liberal ideals upon their offspring will doom their genetic line : <PARA> sure , adams ’ piece is meant to be political and is potentially even a poorly - executed attempt at satire ( though his followers probably don ’ t see it that way ), but it was published on a site that bills itself as “ a science - based natural health advocacy organization ,” and it is riddled with scientific errors in an effort to make a largely inflammatory ( if not incoherent ) point . <PARA> the larger fallacy that adams is committing is the serious problem : abusing scientific information to convince people that the natural world supports your version of humanity and that people who don ’ t fit that view are , as adams put it , “ little more than aberrations of nature .”
false	as you may have guessed from the example above , something happened in 2008 while democratic vice presidential candidate tim kaine was governor of virginia having to do with police chaplains praying to jesus and being out of a job . what news reportage from the time clearly shows , however , is that nobody got fired , and the governor had little , if anything , to do with what transpired . <PARA> this is how the incident was reported by the washington post on 25 september 2008 : <PARA> according to the post and other sources , kaine did not initiate the directive ( although he did support the superintendent ’ s decision ). and despite attempts by partisan media outlets to portray the troopers ’ leaving their voluntary chaplain posts as “ firings ” or “ forced resignations ,” all six resigned by choice to protest the new rule . <PARA> “ while the executive staff and col . flaherty are highly respected and provide great leadership ,” one of the resigning chaplains , trooper rex carter , told the post , “ this is just a policy several of us could not agree with when it comes to the issue of individual prayer .” <PARA> contemporaneous news coverage by the virginian - pilot confirmed that the resignations were voluntary : <PARA> republican gov . bob mcdonnell directed the police superintendent to reinstate sectarian prayers after assuming office in 2010 .
true	motivational quotes are rife online , but unfortunately inspirational words are often fabricated , misattributed , or attached to photographs of unrelated public figures . so when an image of lady gaga started to circulate on social media in february 2019 shortly after the singer won an academy award for “ best song ,” along with a bit of text supposedly spoken by her about an ex - boyfriend , some viewers were skeptical that the quote was authentic : <PARA> the purported statement from lady gaga read : “ i had a boyfriend who told me i ’ d never succeed , never be nominated for a grammy , never have a hit & hoped i ’ d fail . i said to him someday , when we ’ re not together , you won ’ t be able to order a cup of coffee at the fucking deli without hearing or seeing me .” <PARA> these words were indeed spoken by lady gaga , although not during her acceptance speech at the 2019 academy awards or at any other time related to the february 2019 awards season . <PARA> this quote was nearly a decade old at the time it was popularized , as it came from a 2010 cover story interview with lady gaga published by cosmopolitan magazine : <PARA> the full interview is not available online , but other web outlets such as huffington post and mtv published excerpts from it ( emphasis ours ): <PARA> lady gaga was nominated for her first grammy award in 2008 . by the time this interview was published in april 2010 , her figurative trophy shelf was lined with five grammy awards . <PARA> lady gaga ’ s acceptance speech at the 2019 academy awards also centered on fighting for one ’ s dreams , although it included no mention of any ex - boyfriends : <PARA> of course , we can merely verify that lady gaga quoted these words . whether they constitute something a former boyfriend truly said to her , only she knows .

unproven	all girls need to be very aware !!!! i know you have all probably heard about the body of the crawfordville woman being found with out a head , arms or legs but what you may not have heard of is the body of a 34 yre old man being found on tram road also missing a head , arms , and legs and then another body of a woman being found at the georgia / florida line thats missing a head , arms . and legs as well . the police are not releasing any of this information due it interfereing in their case but we should all me aware ! <PARA> origins : on 1 december 2007 , 46 - year - old cheryl hodges dunlap , a florida state university nurse and sunday school teacher , went missing near tallahassee , florida . two days later her car was found abandoned by the side of a highway with a flat tire . over the subsequent weeks , her atm card was used three times by someone who obscured his identity with a mask . everyone ’ s <PARA> worst fears were confirmed on 15 december 2007 , when dunlap ’ s body was discovered in the woods near bloxham cutoff road . she had been murdered . <PARA> the e - mail quoted above began landing in the snopes . com inbox in mid - december 2007 . it attempts to link the dunlap murder (“ that lady from crawfordville ”) with two other killings , asserting that all three victims ’ bodies were found missing their heads , arms , and legs . while the police are playing their cards close to their vest in the dunlap murder regarding the condition of the corpse ( admitting only that “ there ’ s evidence to indicate that this perpetrator made efforts to delay our ability to identity ms . dunlap ”), the body of michael lee gerrard ( the “ 34 - year - old man ” referred to in the examples cited above ), found on 4 december 2007 off tram road , wasn ’ t dismembered , said maj . bill bullock of the jefferson county sheriff ’ s office . <PARA> dismembered bodies have also been found along a rural road near lagrange in troup county , georgia , and in ormond beach , florida ( near daytona ); however , no evidence links those homicides with the dunlap murder . <PARA> said maj . mike wood of the leon county sheriff ’ s office : “ as it relates to this case there ’ s been a multitude of e - mails and information circulated through this community . what i can tell you is a message from sheriff larry campbell — as it relates especially to the e - mails we ’ re seeing more of today than we have — are that these e - mails are a blatant lie ; they are related to three alleged homicides . we have no knowledge of these homicides ... we take the posture that these e - mails are a blatant lie . they ’ re intended to discredit the sheriff ’ s office , to discredit this investigation and they ’ re nothing more than a hindrance to this investigation . they ’ re causing our community to panic unnecessarily .” <PARA> however , while the leon county sheriff ’ s office ( florida ) doesn ’ t perceive a connection between the three homicides described in the e - mailed warning , it is now considering one of them in connection with another that was not part of the e - mail . the january 2008 murder of hiker meredith emerson in georgia by gary michael hilton has caused that agency to look at hilton as a suspect in the slaying of cheryl hodges dunlap ( the e - mail ’ s “ that lady from crawfordville ”) in florida . hilton was in the area at the time of dunlap ’ s disappearance .
unproven	in september 2019 , we received multiple inquiries from readers regarding an old story about the origins of the famous kfc original recipe — the blend of herbs and spices that went into creating “ colonel ” harland sanders ’ original kentucky fried chicken . <PARA> the african diaspora facebook page wrote : “ meet mrs . childress . colonel sanders stole his famous fried chicken recipe from a black woman named mrs . childress . he later paid her $ 1 , 200 for her recipe . kfc is worth 15 billion dollars today .” that text was accompanied by the following image : <PARA> on sept . 3 , a facebook account with the name glenn dickens wrote , “ in case you didn ’ t know . meet miss childress , she died in poverty . she is the woman behind the original # kfc recipe . he took all her profits and made us think it was his recipe .” <PARA> in recent years , this story has appeared in many other social media posts , memes , and articles , all of them claiming that the recipe that made sanders rich and gave rise to one of the most popular fast - food chains in american history was initially stolen from a black woman ( sometimes named “ mrs . childress ,” sometimes “ miss childress ,” and in some instances not named ). <PARA> many iterations of the story hold that sanders later handed over the relatively meager amount of $ 1 , 200 after getting pressured by the woman ’ s family , and most posts include an image of an african american woman preparing fried chicken in a kitchen , describing her as “ miss childress .” <PARA> in reality , the image was taken from a 1920s magazine advertisement for snowdrift shortening , one that played on racist and painfully outdated stereotypes of that era , and depicted the woman ( named only as “ sarah ”) as an exemplar of the racist “ mammy ” caricature — a cheerful , black , female domestic servant to white families , especially in the segregation - era american south . <PARA> it ’ s possible the image is a photograph , but it is perhaps more likely a painting , since the norm for popular american magazines in the 1920s — such as ladies ’ home journal , where the “ sarah ” advertisement was published — was for photographs to be printed in black and white , with illustrations presented in color . it ’ s not clear who the woman depicted in the advertisement was or on whom she was modeled , so we cannot rule out the possibility that she was the “ miss childress ” described in the kfc memes . <PARA> also , evidence is lacking in support of the main claim — that sanders stole his famous original fried chicken recipe from a black woman named miss childress . a 2010 blog post claimed that : “ ron douglas in ‘ america ’ s most wanted recipes ’ says that sanders took his secret recipe from a black woman , one miss childress of kentucky , whose family he paid $ 1 , 200 when they complained .” however , douglas ’ book does not , in fact , make any such claim . <PARA> we found no evidence to support the “ miss childress ” story in a newspaper archive that stretches back more than 100 years , and the prominent food writer joshua ozersky made no mention of sanders ’ having stolen the recipe from a specific black woman , in his widely cited 2003 biography “ colonel sanders and the american dream .” <PARA> the version of events presented there by ozersky is the conventionally accepted one : sanders set up a gas station in corbin , kentucky , during the 1930s , then began serving food there , including fried chicken . his food and hospitality garnered the gas station a good reputation among passing travelers , and he eventually converted the business into a restaurant and motel . sanders settled upon a blend of 11 herbs and spices that went into making his fried chicken , and began using a pressure cooker to fry the chicken . in later years , he franchised out the use of his recipe to restaurants across the united states , and from there the iconic brand emerged . <PARA> sanders ’ decision to use a pressure cooker ( rather than a pan or deep fryer ) to make the chicken was arguably the key factor in the development of fried chicken as “ fast food ” and the extraordinary success of kentucky fried chicken . this is a factor the “ miss childress ” memes and social media posts typically neglect , suggesting as they do that the success of sanders and kfc was entirely attributable to the blend of herbs and spices used to season the chicken itself . according to ozersky , for example , the use of the pressure cooker was considerably more important . as he wrote in his 2003 biography of sanders : <PARA> “... what made the chicken great was the innovation of using a pressure cooker to make it . it ’ s much less glamorous than any secret mixture of herbs and spices but far more important ... no one was going to start a fast food empire using cast - iron skillets , even if those were the best way to cook chicken . ( and they are ...) it takes too long to make chicken in a pan and even the most colossal version hammered out by a southern smithy can only hold thirty pieces at a time at most .” <PARA> sanders patented his pressure cooker process in 1966 , writing in his application that the method he had come up with allowed a cook to create “ accurately controlled conditions of temperature , pressure , time , sizes of serving pieces , and amount and composition of breading used , for the purpose of producing superior taste , texture and appearance in the finished product .” <PARA> while ozersky cited no specific act of intellectual property theft on the part of sanders , he did allude to the racial tensions and cultural appropriation involved in the development of fried chicken in the early 20th century american south , writing that sanders embodied the following “ paradox ”: <PARA> “ anyone who knew anything of the south knew that no kentucky colonel would have cooked the fried chicken in a southern household ; the chicken in prosperous southern households , particularly in the colonel ’ s era , was inevitably cooked by a black maid or family housekeeper . colonel sanders created an alternative reality in which the white planter not only ate the chicken but implicitly made it . nothing could have been further from the truth .” <PARA> we also put the “ miss childress ” story to psyche williams - forson , chair of the department of american studies at the university of maryland college park , an expert in the interaction of food , cultural history and women ’ s studies and author of the 2006 book “ building houses out of chicken legs : black women , food and power .” <PARA> she told us she had found “ no direct evidence that colonel sanders ‘ stole ’ the kfc recipe from an african american woman ,” and had come across no information that indicated sanders later paid the woman $ 1 , 200 under pressure from her family . <PARA> however , williams - forson emphasized that a history does exist of white entrepreneurs and chefs taking recipes from african american women and men , without giving them proper credit . she pointed to the example of idella parker , who was a long - time maid to the white cookbook author marjorie kinnan rawlings , and later an author in her own right . in her 2006 book , williams - forson wrote : <PARA> “ the cookbook , according to parker , required ‘ months and months together ’ in rawlings ’ tiny kitchen extracting the recipes from ‘[ parker ’ s ] hands and head .’ [ parker ] says : ‘ many of the recipes in the book were mine , but [ rawlings ] only gave me credit for three of them , including ‘ idella ’ s biscuits .’ there were several others that were mine too , such as the chocolate pie , and of course it was me who did most of the cooking when we were trying the recipes out .’ <PARA> “ in the end , parker , whose many contributions made the cookbook a reality , only received an autographed copy . but of this she says , ‘ in those days i was grateful for any little crumb that white people let fall , so i kept my thoughts about the cookbook strictly to myself .'” <PARA> more broadly , williams - forson told us , “ some black women who performed domestic service had their recipes improperly ‘ borrowed .'” she added : <PARA> “ given that throughout enslavement and long after , african american and white women often worked together in the kitchen instructing and cooking various recipes , it is quite difficult to make a strong assertion of whose recipe belongs to whom . the issue , however , is that african american women were never credited in cookbooks . how is this possible given the proven evidence of african american culinary skill ?” <PARA> despite the absence of documentary evidence to support the “ miss childress ” theory , williams - forson outlined the reasons why it should not be dismissed , writing to us in an email : <PARA> “ this is not to say it did not happen . i am saying i did not find this evidence . and where might this evidence be uncovered ? would sanders have acknowledged it ? might the african american family have kept a receipt ? this is a needle in a haystack because it happened so often to african americans , who were denied the opportunity to read and write , and thus were unable to document their culinary practices .” <PARA> although we have found no evidence to support the claim , it is possible that sanders did directly steal his fried chicken recipe from a specific african american woman , who may or may not have been named childress . if he did , it is also plausible that no documentary evidence of that act of plagiarism ever existed , or that if it did , it has not survived . <PARA> alternatively , sanders might have borrowed and taken elements of several fried chicken recipes , perhaps some of them invented by , or passed down or shared between , african american women — in the way that many recipes evolve and change over the years . “ miss childress ” might simply be a stand - in or symbolic victim in the wider legacy of appropriation and intellectual property theft that characterized much of the cultural relations between whites and blacks in early 20th - century america . until and unless we obtain concrete evidence that clears up that uncertainty , we are issuing a rating of “ unproven .”

unproven	in the 8 january 2019 run - up to a primetime address by president donald trump on border security and the ongoing government shutdown over that issue , the republican national committee ( rnc ) released a set of seven facts on a page titled “ borderfacts . com .” this article addresses the first claim on that page , which states ( in full ): “ in four customs and border protection sectors where physical barriers have been expanded — el paso , yuma , tucson , and san diego — illegal traffic has dropped by at least 90 %.” <PARA> the wording used in that claim was extremely vague . the rnc claimed that illegal traffic had dropped by 90 % in four specific sectors which they described as locations “ where physical barriers have been expanded ,” implying ( but not directly stating ) that other sectors had seen no expansion of barriers . thanks largely to the secure fence act of 2006 and the dhs appropriations act of 2008 , the mileage of physical barrier along the u . s . southern border with mexico expanded from 119 miles to 654 miles between 2005 and 2015 , according to the nonpartisan government accountability office ( gao ): <PARA> however , this increase in border fencing was not limited solely to the four cbp sectors that the rnc cherry - picked for this statistic . both the el centro sector and the rio grande valley sector , the latter of which showed an increase in border apprehensions , also experienced an increase in fencing but were not included in the rnc “ fact ”. <PARA> the department of homeland security ( dhs ) uses border apprehensions as a marker for attempted crossings , but the rnc did not specify which years they were comparing . the border apprehension figures provided by cbp from 2000 - 2017 and organized in this document show that every sector ( with the exception of the fence - containing rio grande valley ) saw a decline in apprehensions . <PARA> below we have plotted the number of apprehensions at each sector from 2000 - 2017 in the sectors highlighted by the rnc , as well as the ones the rnc left out of their analysis : <PARA> the overall trend along the southern border has broadly been one of declining apprehensions , regardless of fencing or barriers in various sectors . the only section that saw a net increase in border apprehensions over the 2000 - 2017 time period was the rio grande valley , which was also the only sector “ where physical barriers have been expanded ” that the rnc conveniently omitted from their “ fact ”. in total , border apprehensions across all sectors dropped 81 % from 2000 - 2017 : <PARA> all that said , the only way to demonstrate a 90 +% decline in apprehensions in each of the sectors highlighted by the rnc is to play around with the years being compared . the only way the el paso sector ’ s decline in apprehensions can be made to top 90 %, for example , is by comparing that sector ’ s maximum and minimum values rather than the data from the first and final years of the timeframe ( 2000 - 2017 ) in question . <PARA> since the rnc provided no “ before ” and “ after ” dates , they were technically free to pick and choose what years they wanted to compare . so to make their case for the el paso sector , they could choose to compare 2005 to 2012 , which yields a 92 % reduction in border apprehensions for that sector . similarly , only a few comparisons make the yuma sector top the 90 % figure , so the rnc could have simply chosen to use the years 2005 and 2011 , which yields a 96 % reduction for that sector . <PARA> the tucson section solidly shows a decline pretty much any way one looks at it , including over the entire 2000 - 2017 period , which yields a 94 % reduction in apprehensions . the san diego sector , on the other hand , requires going back even further than 2000 to make its apparent reduction in apprehensions top 90 %. the highest value achievable within the 2000 - 2017 dataset comes from comparing 2008 to 2017 , which produces an 84 % reduction . <PARA> because of the vaguely worded nature of this “ fact ,” one could make the argument that , since the san diego sector was the first sector to experience any wall construction , it would still technically count as a sector “ where physical barriers have been expanded ” even if one used statistics going back all the way back to 1990 , right before the first barrier was completed . that year saw roughly four times as many border apprehensions as year in the 2000 - 2017 dataset , and manipulating the numbers this way results in a 94 % reduction in apprehensions in san diego . <PARA> overall , this “ fact ” is so vaguely worded that it can be technically true ( though only by using inconsistent methods for evaluating each sector ) while still being meaningless in terms of demonstrating a border wall ’ s efficacy . the overall trend during the past decade has been a significant decline in border apprehensions in nearly all sectors , including some that have had border barriers built / expanded , and some that have not .

false	the faux news article reproduced below is a masterful bit of political effluvium , one which proffers the “ shocking revelation ” that not only were the bulk of donations to senator barack obama ’ s presidential campaign made via the internet coming from a handful of wealthy financiers in china , saudi arabia , iran , and “ other middle eastern countries ” ( rather than from american voters ), but that senator obama was fine with accepting such tainted and compromised funding because of the technicality that “ none of these donations violated campaign financing laws ”: <PARA> the article was not , as claimed in its header , written by veteran political columnist maureen dowd ( her 29 june 2008 column was about senator hillary clinton ’ s supporters , not the financing of senator obama ’ s campaign ), who said of it : <PARA> and aside from the article ’ s bogus attribution , the facts it posits about contributions to the obama campaign are wrong : the bulk of the money raised by the obama campaign via donations in 2008 came from contributions of $ 200 or larger , not contributions of “$ 10 to $ 25 or so ,” and campaigns must , by federal law , identify “ all pacs and party committees that give them contributions , and they must identify individuals who give them more than $ 200 in an election cycle .” <PARA> a september 2012 report by the government accountability institure has been touted by some as proving that the “ obama campaign has been receiving illegal donations ,” but that report doesn ’ t actually document any verifiable instances of illegal foreign donations to the obama campaign . the report notes that both major - party candidates had issues with fraudulent internet campaign donations in the 2008 election , and that in the 2012 election both major - party candidates ’ campaign literature has been circulated on foreign social media with links to pages through which donations can be made . the report observed that failure to utilize industry - standard security protections on campaign sites ( particularly by the obama campaign ) has made candidates more vulnerable to receiving fraudulent and illegal foreign campaign donations . <PARA> the report also cited the “ curious case ” of the obama . com web site , which is not owned or managed by the obama campaign , but which in september 2008 was purchased by a “ bundler with considerable business ties in china ” and in october 2010 was transferred to an anonymous registration . the report noted that foreign links to obama . com have driven a good deal of foreign traffic to donation pages on the official obama campaign web site , and that “ these links increase the probability that foreign nationals will try to donate to the obama campaign ,” but the report did not cite any documented instances of illegal foreign campaign contributions being accepted through traffic from obama . com .
false	in late 2017 and early 2018 , the # metoo movement on social media — prompted by a series of sexual harassment and sexual assault scandals involving high - profile men — brought consent and sexual misconduct to the forefront of public debate . <PARA> in this climate , facebook posts in january 2018 falsely described proposed changes to the law around rape and sexual assault in sweden . <PARA> on 15 january 2018 , the survivalist facebook page survive our collapse wrote : <PARA> the page — which frequently posts anti - muslim , xenophobic and anti - liberal content — also posted a link to a december 2017 associated press article that appeared in the guardian , along with a photograph of the purported “ sex consent card .” <PARA> the card reads : <PARA> a day earlier , the right - wing , pro - gun rights facebook page right news posted the same message with the same guardian article , but without the photograph of the “ consent card .” <PARA> and on 17 january , jonathan babine posted a screenshot of the survive our collapse post to another facebook group , garnering 15 , 000 shares within a week . <PARA> the claim that sweden is about to mandate sexual consent forms is false and a misrepresentation of a real proposal currently being debated in sweden . the photograph of the “ sex consent card ” posted by survive our collapse is a hoax and is not in any way connected to the swedish proposal . <PARA> in december 2017 , the swedish government introduced a bill that would mean prosecutors charging someone with sexual assault or rape need only demonstrate the absence of explicit consent in advance of sexual contact , according to a ministry of justice statement . <PARA> currently , swedish law requires that prosecutors prove the involvement of physical coercion or threats of violence , in order to advance a conviction . the proposed law , which the government said would be enacted by july 2018 , changes that . <PARA> in a correction to their original story , the associated press clarified that the bill would not shift the burden of proof to an individual accused of sexual assault to provide evidence of explicit consent . rather , prosecutors would have to provide evidence that no explicit consent was given . <PARA> furthermore , sweden ’ s embassy in germany took the step of publicly debunking german news reports claiming that the proposed changes would require written consent of the kind claimed in survive our collapse ’ s facebook post . in a statement , the embassy wrote : <PARA> in one sense , the proposed law would lower the bar for evidence required to get a sexual assault conviction , because prosecutors would no longer have to prove the involvement of physical force or threats of violence . however , it could also be difficult for prosecutors to prove the absence of explicit , prior consent . <PARA> on 23 january 2018 , sweden ’ s legislative council recommended against introducing the proposed changes , according to a swedish bar association press release . <PARA> the lagrådet — a government agency composed of senior judges that gives non - binding recommendations on proposed legislation — said the consent law would allow for too much subjectivity on the part of judges , and therefore did not provide the “ predictability ” required of a new law . <PARA> swedish governments often heed the advice of the legislative council , but the consent proposal is part of a raft of measures to toughen penalties for sexual assault and rape , and has been a long - standing policy goal for the coalition government of social democratic prime minister stefan löfven . the fate of the proposal remained undetermined , as of 26 january 2018 . <PARA> the photograph included in survive our collapse ’ s post is a hoax . the earliest example we could find was in a february 2015 post on the “ gorgeous active duty females – u . s .” facebook page . <PARA> the card was probably intended as a distasteful joke in response to a long - running sexual assault scandal within the united states military . <PARA> the phrase “ do not accept an article 15 ” is a reference to article 15 of the uniform code of military justice , which allows an armed services member accused of a relatively minor offense to request a hearing overseen by their commanding officer ( a practice known as “ non - judicial punishment ”) rather than more serious alternatives such as a court - martial . <PARA> the phrase “ do not confess to the mps ” is a reference to “ military police ” ( mp ) officers .

true	we first encountered this warning about straight ticket voting a few months before the 2008 presidential election , and it reappeared in july 2012 in anticipation of that year ’ s presidential election . the warning does have some merit to it , but it only applies to residents of a single state ( north carolina ). <PARA> when casting their ballots in elections , some voters choose to select candidates individually regardless of party affiliation ( i . e ., they may vote for a republican candidate for one office but a democratic candidate for another office ), while some voters choose to go with what is known as a “ straight ticket ” ( i . e ., they cast their ballots for all the candidates of one party ). the ballots in some states simplify the process of straight ticket voting ( stv ): rather than having to vote for every candidate from a particular party individually , the voter can fill in a bubble , or punch a hole , or mark a box , or pull a lever that is indicated as casting votes for all candidates of a specified party in partisan offices . <PARA> examples : <PARA> the item quoted above warns voters that selecting the straight ticket option may not result in their casting a ballot for their party ’ s presidential candidate because presidential selections have to be undertaken separately from the straight ticket voting process . voting processes vary from region to region , and as far as we know this warning applies only to north carolina , where straight ticket voting is available for all races except for presidential electors ; voters in that state ( regardless of party ) therefore need to specifically select a presidential candidate in addition to voting a straight ticket . <PARA> as the charlotte observer cautioned readers back in 2008 : <PARA> the best advice to ensure your votes count as you intend is to study a sample ballot in advance , read the ballot and voting instructions provided to you at the polling place carefully before casting your vote ( s ), and ask a poll worker for assistance if you are unsure about any aspect of the voting procedures . if you think you may have spoiled your ballot , do not hesitate to report the situation to a poll worker . <PARA> another thing to keep in mind is that some political parties may not field candidates for every single partisan office on a ballot , so by selecting a straight ticket you may end up not voting at all in some races . therefore , if you plan to vote a straight ticket , you might want to review your ballot first to verify that your party has a candidate running for every partisan office listed ( and also be sure to cast votes for non - partisan offices not included in the straight ticket selection process ). as they say , “ if you ’ re going to take the time to vote , take a few extra seconds and make every vote count .”

false	in october 2019 , after the reported death of the islamic state group ( is ) leader abu bakr al - baghdadi , some apparent supporters of u . s . president donald trump turned their focus towards his predecessor ’ s record with regard to the terrorist network . <PARA> right - wing conspiracy theorists have long claimed , implied , or speculated that former president barack obama has questionable loyalty to the united states , or that he is a secret muslim and even a secret militant islamist . trump himself has repeatedly promulgated such false allegations , including the birther conspiracy theory , and during the 2016 presidential campaign he described obama , more than once , as the “ founder ” of is . <PARA> after the death of al - baghdadi — who reportedly detonated a suicide vest during a u . s . raid on a compound in syria — multiple social media users shared one article in particular : a 2015 post on newspunch , a website formerly known as yournewswire , which is known to publish junk news as well as sensationalist distortions of real news stories . the headline read “ declassified documents : obama ordered cia to train isis .” the article reported that : <PARA> “ government watchdog judicial watch published more than 100 pages of formerly classified documents from the u . s . department of defense and the state department . the documents obtained through a federal lawsuit revealed the agencies earlier views on isis , namely that they were a desirable presence in eastern syria in 2012 and that they should be ‘ supported ’ in order to isolate the syrian regime . <PARA> “ the u . s . intelligence documents not only confirms [ sic ] suspicions that the united states and some of its coalition allies had actually facilitated the rise of the isis in syria — as a counterweight to the syrian government of president bashar al - assad — but also that isis members were initially trained by members and contractors of the central intelligence agency at facilities in jordan in 2012 .” <PARA> the newspunch article cited a few sources , including a 2015 article on the website examiner . com , whose headline similarly claimed “ obama ordered cia to train isis jihadists : declassified documents ,” and a 2015 altervista blog post . the examiner . com article stated : <PARA> “ u . s . intelligence documents released to a government watchdog confirms [ sic ] the suspicions that the united states and some of its so - called coalition partners had actually facilitated the rise of the islamic state of iraq and syria ( isis ) as an effective adversary against the government of the syrian dictator president bashar al - assad . in addition , isis members were initially trained by members and contractors of the central intelligence agency ( cia ) at facilities in jordan in 2012 . the original goal was to weaken the syrian government which had engaged in war crimes against their own people , according to a number of reports on sunday .” <PARA> the examiner . com report also cited as a source the same altervista post , which stated “ the isis terrorists , who were initially trained by the cia in jordan in 2012 to destabilize the syrian government , are engaged in crimes against humanity in the areas under their control .” notably , that post was in reality a republication of a may 2015 article published by press tv , iran ’ s state - funded television network . <PARA> the claim that the cia , under orders from obama , had set out to train is in 2012 , was not actually contained or revealed in declassified u . s . department of defense documents , contrary to both newspunch ’ s and examiner . com ’ s characterization . the claim instead originated in a report by an iranian state - funded broadcaster . <PARA> internal emails obtained by judicial watch through freedom of information act requests included an august 2012 memo distributed to military , defense , homeland security , fbi , and state department officials , which gave a provisional outline of the circumstances surrounding , and participants involved in , the syrian civil war , as follows : <PARA> “ the salafist , the muslim brotherhood , and aqi [ al qaeda in iraq ] are the major forces driving the insurgency in syria . the west , gulf countries , and turkey support the opposition , while russia , china and iran support the [ assad ] regime .” <PARA> of particular relevance , that memo also included the following “ assumptions ” and predictions : <PARA> the memo thus indicated that western countries , including the united states , were at that time supportive of the opposition to syrian president bashar al - assad . this was not a revelatory point in october 2019 , nor in may 2015 , when judicial watch published the internal documents , nor even in 2012 , when the obama administration openly and publicly declared its support for the rebels . <PARA> the memo does not even mention u . s .- backed training of syrian opposition forces , and certainly does not articulate a viewpoint that is pro - is , or reflect a desire or intent , on the part of obama himself or any part of his administration , to train , equip , bolster or facilitate is . <PARA> in fact , the very same memo , quoted so extensively in the articles mentioned above , actually cites the emergence of is in iraq as one of the potentially “ dire consequences ” of the instability caused by the syrian civil war , stating : <PARA> however , the united states did train and arm syrian rebels , beginning in late 2012 / early 2013 . the program began as a covert cia operation , but was later formalized and given the code name “ timber sycamore ,” although it remained classified . trump ordered the operation to be closed down in 2017 , according to reports . <PARA> during its years of operation , timber sycamore reportedly saw hundreds of millions of dollars spent , annually , on arming and training thousands of anti - government syrian rebels . that ’ s largely what happened , but according to multiple reports and investigations , some of the arms provided to the rebels were stolen or traded and ended up on the black market in syria , with some ultimately being acquired by is fighters . <PARA> that was an unfortunate and inadvertent consequence of the program , rather than its aim . indeed , far from intending the program to be used to train or arm is fighters , the obama administration actually set up a separate initiative , with congressional approval , specifically to train and equip syrian rebels to fight against is . the program was not a success and was shut down in 2015 . <PARA> both newspunch and examiner . com claimed that obama had “ ordered the cia to train isis .” that ’ s not what happened . <PARA> according to multiple reports by reputable news organizations , the cia ( under the obama administration ) carried out a covert program of training and arming syrian rebels to fight against the assad regime . that ’ s largely what the program achieved , too ; but as a result of greed and corruption , some of the weapons supplied to the rebels were sold on to the black market , and some of those ended up in the hands of is fighters . <PARA> one could conduct a reasonable debate about the obama administration ’ s overall management of the program , its efforts to vet the intermediaries involved , or prevent foreseeable theft or smuggling of the weapons , and so on . but one cannot , based on the facts available , claim that obama “ ordered the cia to train is .” he didn ’ t . <PARA> moreover , we know for a fact that he implemented a program that set out to do just the opposite — training and equipping syrian rebels to fight and destroy is .

mixture	what ’ s true : fema assesses the impact of natural disasters by measuring their interruption of multiple large national chains and informally references a “ waffle house index .” <PARA> what ’ s false / undetermined : waffle house is the only business whose operations are measured to determine natural disaster impact , and fema formally uses waffle house closures to assess the scope of disasters . <PARA> origins : the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) has inspired a number of rumors , myths , and urban legends . while the majority of these rumors are conspiracy - based ones involving fema camps , fema coffins , or general martial law conspiracies , another oft - referenced claim holds that fema uses something called the “ waffle house index ” to assess the scope , scale , and impact of regional national disasters . <PARA> given its large presence in modern - day tinfoil hat lore , it ’ s sometimes hard to remember that fema ’ s primary purpose isn ’ t enforcing the new world order upon us any day now . wikipedia concisely summarizes fema ’ s primary purpose as being “ to coordinate the response to a disaster that has occurred in the united states and that overwhelms the resources of local and state authorities .” fema operated as an independent agency from its effective creation in 1979 until 2003 , when the homeland security act of 2002 brought it into the department of homeland security ( dhs ). ( it ’ s possible that fema ’ s 2003 move from its originally independent status to being part of a law enforcement agency partly inspired fears that fema was sinister or authoritarian in nature .) <PARA> compounding fema ’ s public relations challenge is the fact that fema only tends to be involved in times of great distress . for americans to require fema ’ s help , whatever happened on the ground must have been quite severe . on top of that , the then newly - reorganized agency ’ s widely - criticized , delayed response to hurricane katrina in 2005 left many with the impression fema was a bumbling ( and at worst , carelessly lethal ) example of federal inefficiency . <PARA> as the specter of katrina faded , an interesting claim about fema began circulating around 2011 . it held that one of fema ’ s core disaster assessment metrics involved the waffle house chain , and the level of impact on the operations of waffle houses near any given disaster factored into the agency ’ s classification of the severity of such events . on 7 july 2011 an article titled “ news of the day — what do waffle houses have to do with risk management ?” was published to fema ’ s blog and explained that : <PARA> fema ’ s blog in turn referenced a 6 july 2011 article in occupational safety publication ehs today : <PARA> that article went on to explain specifically how waffle house factored into fema ’ s disaster assessment practices : <PARA> the notion that fema bases its disaster assessments entirely on the impact on waffle house locations appeared to originate with that article . however , the context indicated that waffle house was one of several large chains observed by fema to assess how badly affected an area ’ s operations might be after a national disaster . <PARA> a 19 july 2011 insurance journal article credited kouvelis with the insight about large chains in general , quoting him as indicating that “ companies that are most frequently exposed to supply - chain disruption are the ones that have the best risk management plans .” that article focused on the general concept of looking to the biggest business entities to determine impact on operations , not necessarily just waffle house : <PARA> on 1 september 2011 , fugate was quoted in a wall street journal ( in an article on the clues yielded by the chain alongside more formal metrics such as the saffir - simpson wind scale : <PARA> perhaps more interesting than fema ’ s reliance on waffle house was the chain ’ s own disclosures about disaster management that were related in the wsj article . while the company admitted “ sales volume can double or triple in the aftermath ” of a disaster , waffle house maintained their “ strategy is more about marketing and building goodwill than profits ”: <PARA> since fema , fugate , and kouvelis ’ mention of fema ’ s “ waffle house index ” in 2011 , the “ fun fact ” has slowly become a staple of listicles and other “ strange but true ” articles . however , the applicable metric is neither formal nor universal : hurricane sandy ( for instance ) primarily affected new york and new jersey , where waffle house isn ’ t an omnipresent brand . the professor who popularized the idea named waffle house among four large chains in total known for disaster preparedness , perhaps none as catchy as waffle house . it ’ s true that fema factors the impact on large businesses into its assessment of natural disasters , but it ’ s similarly accurate to note waffle house itself holds no particular magical ability to divine the scope of a hurricane , earthquake , or flash flood . <PARA> originally published : 30 november 2015

false	on 28 february 2017 , president donald trump appeared before a joint session of congress to deliver a speech similar to a state of the union address , during the latter part of which he took time to introduce carryn owens , the widow of u . s . navy special operator senior chief william ‘ ryan ’ owens . ryan owens died in a raid in yemen , the first american combatant to die during the presidency of donald trump , and the introduction of his widow was met with a standing ovation by those present in the house chamber : <PARA> among the reactions to president trump ’ s speech , and that particular portion of it , was a false and manufactured controversy holding that prominent democrats debbie wasserman schultz , keith ellison , bernie sanders , and nancy pelosi “ refused to stand ” to honor mrs . owens . for example , a blaze article headlined “ meet the democrats who refused to stand and applaud the widow of a fallen navy seal ” asserted that : <PARA> a daily wire item headlined “ awful : top democrats refuse to stand , clap for navy seal widow honored by trump ” proclaimed that : <PARA> a 100percentfedup piece headlined “ horrible ! top democrats refuse to stand for gold star widow ” maintained that : <PARA> but examination of multiple video and photographic sources ( including the full video of president trump ’ s speech , embedded below ) documents that the claim “ democrats refuse to stand for gold star widow ” was undeniably false . <PARA> the sequence of events began when president trump introduced mrs . owens by saying “ we are blessed to be joined tonight by carryn owens , the widow of u . s . navy special operator , senior chief william ‘ ryan ’ owens . ryan died as he lived : a warrior , and a hero — battling against terrorism and securing our nation .” at that point , members from both sides of the aisle stood and applauded in acknowledgment of a teary - eyed carryn owens , who remained seated ( and did not herself clap ) in acknowledgment that the ovation was directed at her : <PARA> as we documented in a video we compiled ( still frames from which are reproduced below ), the visual evidence proves that , in fact , all four of the democrats named did indeed stand and honor mrs . owens when she was introduced . <PARA> rep . nancy pelosi was standing and applauding the introduction of mrs . owens : <PARA> senator bernie sanders was likewise standing and clapping : <PARA> and reps . wasserman schultz and ellison could also be seen clearly standing at that point ( but camera angle didn ’ t capture their hands to document whether they were applauding ): <PARA> sites such as the daily wire misleadingly tried to make the false case that democrats had remained seated and refused to stand or applaud mrs . owens ’ introduction by presenting images that were deceptively taken out of context from other portions of the speech . for example , the daily wire article ’ s header image seemingly shows reps . wasserman schultz and ellison stubbornly remaining seated and unmoved during the introduction of the gold star widow — but that image actually depicted a portion of the speech that had taken place more than half an hour before the tribute to mrs . owens , while president trump was speaking about inner cities : <PARA> a still image capturing a wider view of the chamber was touted as supposedly showing democrats ( including rep . nancy pelosi ) remaining seated while only republicans cheered mrs . owens , but it was taken from much later in the sequence and depicted members of the audience who had begun sitting down again ( not members who had never stood in the first place ): <PARA> as usual , once the debunkings began , those who promulgated the original false claim began shifting the goalposts , moving off the demonstrably untrue assertion about four democrats who supposedly “ refused to stand for a gold star widow ” and instead focusing on a different portion of the president ’ s speech that was distinctly separate from the introduction of mrs . owens . <PARA> as documented above , after president trump said “ we are blessed to be joined tonight by carryn owens ...”, everyone present ( including debbie wasserman schultz , keith ellison , bernie sanders , and nancy pelosi ) all rose to give her a standing ovation . afterwards , the entire audience sat down again as president trump continued his speech . after trump resumed talking about what he termed the “ highly successful raid [ in yemen ] that generated large amounts of vital intelligence ” in which ryan owens was killed , the audience rose again and delivered a second round of applause . but that subsequent ovation was not for mrs . owens herself , who had already previously been introduced , who had not been mentioned again , and who this time also stood and joined in the applause ( acknowledging that it was not directed at her ): <PARA> promulgators of the “ top democrats refuse to stand , clap for navy seal widow ” headlines seized on this second , separate round of applause to support their inaccurate assertions , but those assertions were false on two counts : this second ovation was not directed at mrs . owens , and the visual evidence again shows that some of those accused of not standing ( e . g . bernie sanders ) were clearly on their feet and applauding even during this subsequent event : <PARA> the visual evidence shows reps . wasserman schultz and ellison seated during portions of that second round of applause , but because cameras were largely focused on mrs . owens and other audience members at that time it ’ s difficult to definitively determine whether those two stood up and then sat down earlier than others did , or did not rise at all a second time . but even if the latter were the case , the claim that “ debbie wasserman schultz , keith ellison , bernie sanders , and nancy pelosi refused to stand for navy seal widow ” is still false ; the most that could be accurately asserted is that two of those four may not have stood during a second , subsequent round of applause that was not directed at mrs . owens . a more accurate description of events than the ones spread via outrage - provoking blog posts would have stated that “ democrats stood for gold star widow , but maybe some of them didn ’ t stand and applaud as long or as much as some republicans did afterwards ,” but of course such honesty wouldn ’ t generate nearly as many click - throughs as false headlines such as “ horrible ! top democrats refuse to stand for gold star widow .”

true	during a debate between presidential candidates on 16 october 2012 , president barack obama mentioned planned parenthood several times , on one occasion stating women “ rely on planned parenthood for ... mammograms , for cervical cancer screenings .” that statement drew criticism asserting that president obama had falsely implied that planned parenthood health centers themselves conduct mammogram procedures : <PARA> it is true in a literal sense that planned parenthood health centers do not themselves conduct mammograms ( a procedure which requires specialized equipment and the expertise to use it ). planned parenthood offers comprehensive breast health care management , which includes manual breast exams as well as patient education on breast health , but not mammograms . <PARA> that care management program includes providing women with information about mammograms , referring them to health centers where they can obtain mammograms , and assisting them in covering the costs of the procedure by referring them to government programs that provide free mammograms or by using grant funds to reimburse the medical providers who perform the mammograms .

false	examples : <PARA> there was an old rumour that stated that a particular diet soda company ( coke i believe ) paid a fine to print their cans as stating that the soda had ‘ just one calorie ’. according to the rumour , companies who knowingly printed misinformation on the nutritional facts of their product would have to pay a fine . the company in question figured it could make more money by convincing people the product only had 1 calorie than it would cost to pay the fine , meaning a higher profit margin for them . <PARA> [ collected on the internet , 2002 ] <PARA> i heard a rumor today that diet coke actually contains 40 calories , and the coca - cola company pays a huge fine to the fda every year to keep “ 0 calories ” on the can . have you heard anything of this ? <PARA> [ collected on the internet , 2004 ] <PARA> comment : is it true that pepsi one is really not one calorie and that pepsi co . pays a fine every year for false advertising ( because the calorie count is a lot higher than that )? <PARA> origins : how long this particular belief about low - calorie sodas has been around is anyone ’ s guess , but we have recorded sightings of it dating back to 1990 . we ’ ve encountered claims of diet coke , diet pepsi , or pepsi one ( which are listed as containing zero , zero , and one calories per 12 - oz . can , respectively ) actually containing 25 , 50 , 70 , or 90 calories , in each case with the parent <PARA> company ’ s paying an annual fine to continue falsely listing the beverage ’ s caloric content . ( a can of non - diet cola typically contains about 120 calories .) the rumor associates most strongly with diet coke ( which is known as coca - cola light outside the u . s ., canada , australia , and great britain ). <PARA> in the u . s ., laws governing the disclosure of nutritional and caloric content of ingestibles prevent the rumor from being true . the federal trade commission serves as the watchdog in this area : under the federal trade commission act , it is empowered to “ prevent persons , partnerships , or corporations ” from using “ unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce , and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce .” at various times in its history it has fined corporations for their having made false or misleading nutritional claims about their products . such fines are a reaction to what has already taken place ; they are not grants of immunity against continued breaking of the rules . consumers have legal remedy available to them against corporations that have deceived them through certain provisions of the lanham act . many other countries have similar safeguards in place . <PARA> common sense should also serve to rule out what the whispers say about an annual payoff . for health reasons , many potential consumers of diet drinks have to carefully monitor what they ingest . were the rumor true , diabetics with a love of diet coke , for instance , would experience glucose levels spiraling out of control . imagine the lawsuits resulting from <PARA> that ! <PARA> this false belief enjoys a measure of popularity because of what it says about common perception of large companies and of the government agencies tasked with shielding consumers from harm : that one will bamboozle its customers for the sake of financial profit , the other will sell out those it is mandated to protect , and neither is to be trusted . such misgivings also find voice in other rumors , such as the one about bananas imported from costa rica being infected with a flesh - eating bacteria . <PARA> if there is the tiniest bit of truth to this rumor , it ’ s that even though sodas such as diet coke and diet pepsi are advertised as having zero calories , they do have some caloric content from ingredients such as artificial sweeteners , citric acid , and caramel coloring . however , the number of calories per can is still less than one , and fda regulations allow any food product that contains fewer than five calories per serving to be advertised as calorie - free . <PARA> barbara “ calorie countered ” mikkelson

unproven	origins : what could be a more painfully embarrassing and shocking violation of your privacy than discovering someone had been watching you ( without your consent or knowledge ) while you were <PARA> engaged in the deeply personal and intimate act of making love with your partner ? how about finding out that someone had secretly made a video tape of the event — one that had been distributed to countless others for their viewing pleasure ? such is the premise of this legend . <PARA> tales of peepholes set up to allow the furtive observance of people ’ s private activities in bathrooms and hotel rooms — and lawsuits resulting from them — have been circulating for years , many of them based on real incidents . in one of the most prominent examples , an iowa couple who celebrated their engagement night with a private evening in a penthouse suite at the canterbury inn in coralville , iowa , in 1988 sued the hotel after discovering a peephole behind a two - way mirror — a peephole that <PARA> gave someone a view into their suite that night . they won their invasion of privacy lawsuit to the tune of $ 4 . 3 million in punitive and compensatory damages ( although they eventually settled for $ 1 million , the limit of the hotel ’ s insurance coverage ). <PARA> the canterbury inn case involved no cameras , but with the advent of home video equipment has grown progressively cheaper , smaller , and better in quality , the creation of a legend ( real or not ) like the example quoted above was inevitable . that version ’ s setting of the poconos (“ the honeymoon capital of the world ”) is an obvious one , for the <PARA> pennsylvania poconos feature no less than eight resorts that cater to couples by offering a variety of romantic facilities . moreover , it was at a cove haven , a small hotel on a lake in the poconos , where morris wilkins invented and installed the world ’ s first heart - shaped bathtub in 1963 . <PARA> what makes this legend particularly interesting from a folkloric standpoint is its age — tales of secretly - filmed sexual encounters antedate the development of the home video market by several decades . in these older versions , however , the victims are not sweethearts or married couples innocently engaged in private lovemaking ( as in the example above ), but characters such as adulterers or bawdy house patrons who are being punished for having transgressed the sexual mores of their times . the following version , for example , comes from a 1927 humor collection : <PARA> a gentleman from idaho was in paris and didn ’ t want to make himself too conspicuous . so he asked a cabby to give him the address of a good whorehouse . he <PARA> went there by himself , quietly , asked for a private room , and , after selecting his partner , ordered dinner with lots of wine . after the meal the man entertained himself in various ways with his playmate , who taught him positions of which even elephantis , aretino and luisa sigea were ignorant . thoroughly drained , the gentleman from idaho went downstairs , where he asked the madam what his bill was . <PARA> “ there is no charge ,” said the lady of the house . <PARA> astonished , but not disposed to argue the matter , her guest left . all next day he hugged his secret to himself . he could barely wait till dinner time before he again presented himself before the bawds . again he went through his performance , but this time , when he made a bluff at paying the piper he was informed the charges were seven hundred francs . <PARA> “ what ! ” he shrieked . “ wasn ’ t i here last evening , and didn ’ t i go through every kind of screw , and you didn ’ t charge me a sou ?” <PARA> “ ah ,” said the madam , “ but last night was for the movies .” <PARA> went there by himself , quietly , asked for a private room , and , after selecting his partner , ordered dinner with lots of wine . after the meal the man entertained himself in various ways with his playmate , who taught him positions of which even elephantis , aretino and luisa sigea were ignorant . thoroughly drained , the gentleman from idaho went downstairs , where he asked the madam what his bill was . <PARA> “ there is no charge ,” said the lady of the house . <PARA> astonished , but not disposed to argue the matter , her guest left . all next day he hugged his secret to himself . he could barely wait till dinner time before he again presented himself before the bawds . again he went through his performance , but this time , when he made a bluff at paying the piper he was informed the charges were seven hundred francs . <PARA> “ what ! ” he shrieked . “ wasn ’ t i here last evening , and didn ’ t i go through every kind of screw , and you didn ’ t charge me a sou ?” <PARA> “ ah ,” said the madam , “ but last night was for the movies .” <PARA> what ’ s even more remarkable is that a tale with all the same elements of this legend ( lovers clandestinely filmed by an outsider , the results displayed to others , the principals ’ finding out through an inadvertent viewing of the film ) date to the very earliest days of motion pictures . consider this description of the 1903 film , the story the biograph told : <PARA> the film opens in a business office , where a man is explaining the operation of a movie camera to an office boy . the boss and an attractive female secretary then enter his office and begin embracing , while , unbeknownst to them , the boy cranks the camera . the scene shifts to a theater , where the boss and his wife are watching a movie , when inexplicably the intimate office encounter is thrown on the screen . the next day , the incensed wife marches into the office , discharges the secretary , and replaces her with a man . <PARA> a variation on the same theme — the movies ’ ability to place people in compromising situations for the amusement of an audience — is echoed in a related legend about a couple ’ s accidentally returning a sexy tape of themselves to a video store . as the proliferation in recent years of amateur sexual videos and live performances via webcams has demonstrated , though , more than a few of us are quite willing to amuse audiences by sharing our intimacies with them . <PARA> sightings : the plot of the infamous ( and originally unaired ) episode of the fox tv series married with children (“ i ’ ll see you in court ”) involves al and peg making a trip to the seedy hop - on inn for a romantic interlude and discovering the porn video in their room is actually a tape the motel secretly made of their neighbors , steve and marcy .

false	on 22 july 2017 , the facebook page “ prepare to take america back ” shared a meme that informed its fans that cnn and other major news media outlets “ buried ” the story of justine ruszczyk ( who went by her fiance ’ s surname damond ), a white australian woman who was shot and killed on 15 july 2017 by a somali - american minneapolis police officer : <PARA> damond , 40 , died after calling 911 at about 11 : 30 p . m . to report what she believed to be a sexual assault happening in an alley near her home . minneapolis police officers matthew harrity and mohamed noor responded to the call . according to a preliminary investigation by the minnesota bureau of criminal apprehension , harrity reported being startled by a loud noise as damond approached the squad car . noor opened fire through harrity ’ s open window , striking her in the abdomen and killing her . a search warrant obtained by minnesota public radio revealed that a female had “ slapped ” the back of the squad car before damond was killed , but it is unclear if she was the one who touched the vehicle . <PARA> cnn and other american news outlets have been under fire from president donald trump and his supporters , many of whom have appropriated the term “ fake news ” to essentially mean organizations and stories that report narratives that they dislike . <PARA> however it is easy to disprove the claim that the news media has buried the damond story in an effort to suppress the fact that the police officer who shot her was an immigrant from somalia . for example , a very simple internet search reveals that cnn has in fact been following the story very closely . they have also pointed out that noor is the minneapolis police department ’ s first officer of somali descent , reporting on 18 july 2017 : <PARA> the case has received widespread attention from media all over the world , not just cnn . it has been covered meticulously by local media , but has also been followed closely by national and international media , including the star tribune , the washington post , cbs , nbc , fox news , the daily beast , usa today , australian media , and more . <PARA> minnesota is notable for its sizable somali minority community — a community that was singled out by donald trump on the campaign trail in november 2016 , saying members of the community were “ joining isis .”

unproven	on 31 october 2016 slate published an article with the headline “ was a trump server communicating with russia ?.” the inquisitive title introduced a lengthy article and a mish - mash of circumstantial details positing that donald trump maintained “ secretive ” financial ties to russia which came to light in the course of an unofficial investigation : <PARA> the article held that a “ bank in moscow kept irregularly pinging a server registered to the trump organization on fifth avenue ,” adding that through further research the investigating parties determined “[ the activity ] wasn ’ t an attack , but a sustained relationship between a server registered to the trump organization and two servers registered to an entity called alfa bank ” and contained several asides about the unquestionable credibility of the unnamed individuals party to the project for example : <PARA> the independent research done by the unnamed “ community of malware hunters ” purportedly commenced in mid - 2016 , shortly after rumors about russian interference in that year ’ s election began circulating . by september 2016 , slate reported that the self - appointed investigators had begun attempting to draw interest to their research ( in one instance , by posting the information to a reddit thread ). after a new york times reporter met with a u . s .- based representative from alfa bank for an unspecified related story , the slate article asserted , a trump domain purportedly under observation “ seemed to suddenly stop working .” the researchers came to a subsequent conclusion , which the piece built upon in a remarkably far reaching manner : <PARA> the slate article ’ s appearance just one week prior to the november 2016 general election unsurprisingly turned heads , despite its speculative nature . on the same day , the partisan occupy democrats web site published an item claiming that in an “ october surprise ” development , abc news had uncovered “ hundreds of millions of dollars ” in payments from russians to trump : <PARA> many social media users exposed only to the dueling headlines were left with the impression the two reports were linked and mutually substantiating . but occupy democrats ’ “ october surprise ” piece was originally reported by another news outlet more than one month earlier and pertained to purported business ( not campaign ) dealings trump had with russian business interests ( some of whom were u . s .- based ). moreover , its editorial focus was whether trump ’ s potential business links to russia would influence his foreign policy decisions ; it did not suggest trump ’ s campaign was being bought by “ russian payments .” <PARA> the trump campaign addressed and denied the allegations , while hillary clinton immediately tweeted twice about them : <PARA> much of the content of the slate piece came from persons unable or unwilling to disclose their identities and credentials ( and were therefore unavailable for questions ), but it wasn ’ t long before cybersecurity expert robert graham of errata security tackled the claims . in a more concise and far less speculative blog post , graham cast reams of doubt on the entire claim set and noted that a hotel marketing management company ( cendyn ), not trump , controlled the domains in question : <PARA> graham concluded by noting that experts consulted by slate offered piecemeal confirmations , none adding up to a whole : <PARA> graham ( who concurrently affirmed on twitter that he was supporting clinton ) supplemented his piece with several tweets providing ancillary information , as well as comment from peers in the field of cybersecurity : <PARA> on the same day slate ‘ s piece appeared , the new york times reporter it referenced published his own article about trump ’ s purported ties to alfa bank . the conclusion of that piece was more in line with graham ’ s take : <PARA> alfa bank also sent us a statement of their own , holding that no connection existed between that financial institution and donald trump : <PARA> rumors about donald trump ’ s purported ties to russia have circulated roughly since the july 2016 dnc leaks and subsequent allegations that information dumped via wikileaks was an attempt to attack hillary clinton for the mutual benefit of those entities . but the slate article ( presented as a question in its title ) simply strung together circumstantial details to suggest trump had a server connection to russia . a concurrent and a subsequent look at its conclusions ( the latter by a cybersecurity expert who was not anonymous ) asserted that the claims were unsubstantiated and likely amounted to nothing . <PARA> in march 2017 , cnn reported that the issue was still under investigation by the fbi , but nothing substantive had yet been turned up :
false	what an honor that must have been for john and his family , but that ’ s not the real story nor is it the historic significance of the 2013 <PARA> commencement celebration . you see 2013 is the first air force graduation on record that has occurred under a sequester created by a nonfunctioning congress and an unyielding obama administration . due to operating under this sequester the ceremonies proceeded as follows : <PARA> president obama regretfully declined the kind invitation of the commandant of the air force academy to be speak to the graduates and their families on the occasion of their graduation saying he was committed to addressing the graduates at west point . instead it was established that vice president biden was free and he would come to colorado springs . <PARA> and , as to the request for fly - over by the us air force thunderbirds that was declined again due to the sequester . <PARA> after consultation with his chain of command the commandant of the air force academy notified the white house that due to the sequester cancelling the traditional fly - over of the thunderbirds that he was confident that the nation didn ’ t need the added $ 1 million + expense to fly air force 2 , of any configuration or model , and the added expense of the secret service and their entourage required when the vice president traveled . <PARA> so just cancel the initial request for a speaker from the white house for the commencement . <PARA> so the commencement went off as planned sans representation from the obama administration . <PARA> it looked like this : <PARA> the featured speaker was an under secretary of the air force , who is a decorated viet nam veteran . the secretary flew back and forth from andrews afb to peterson afb in colorado springs on routine training flight conducted by the air force thus costing the american tax payers nothing . <PARA> john tells me that there were nearly as many air force general officers in attendance as there were family members . he thinks a dozen or more 4 star general , three or four times as many 3 and 2 stars an untold number of 1 star generals . and , of course countless colonels and below . most of these officers were themselves alumni of the air force academy and wanted nothing less than to present a perfect program for the graduating class . since the congress and the obama administration could not see fit to allow for a fly - over by the thunderbirds , a number of the senior generals took matters into their own hands . <PARA> and so , when the speeches , the hats were all thrown into the air , and all the family hugs were all made and it became time for the fly - over a roar of engines was detected from the west of the air strip and parade grounds there at the facility and everyone was treated to a fly - over by the confederate air force . <PARA> looking up we saw vintage aircraft from b - 17s b - 24s , b - 25s , p - 38s , p - 51s and others all flown by our hero ’ s from prior conflicts that still see fit to stay active for services such as this . it was a wonderful experience for all who were there . <PARA> i am sure you will join me in offering a salute to these serving officers who saw fit not to rob the 2013 graduating class of their day of <PARA> celebration , and to our heroes who flew the planes for this worthy occasion , and oh yes , to the many private donors who pitched in <PARA> and covered the expenses involved in bringing these aircraft in to colorado springs from various locations across the country . <PARA> ladies and gentlemen , we salute you !!! <PARA> origins : the u . s . air force academy ’ s ( usafa ) graduation ceremony is typically marked by a flyover performed by the air force thunderbirds aerial demonstration team , but in 2013 sequestration cuts ruled that out , resulting in the class of 2013 ’ s being the first group of graduates in modern memory to go without the traditional flyover . aside from that fact , however , virtually everything else in the account of those ceremonies reproduced above is inaccurate : <PARA> president obama had spoken at the usafa graduation ceremonies in 2012 , he was neither invited nor expected to do so again in 2013 ; instead , according to schedule , in 2013 he was invited to deliver the commencement address at the u . s . naval academy in annapolis .

mixture	to tip or not to tip can be a source of contentious debate , but at some point nearly every diner has been presented with an unexpected ( and perhaps unwarranted ) “ mandatory gratuity ” or service charge . <PARA> in the united states , people in service industries ( such as waitstaff ) often rely heavily on tips . although “ mandatory gratuity ” or “ service charge ” fields once were rare and reserved only for very large parties , the party size required to incur them has apparently grown smaller . <PARA> the public still widely perceives tipping as a reward for good service rather than an obligation ; claims exist that the word “ tips ” is an acronym for “ to insure prompt service ,” which is a backronym , unsubstantiated by the word ’ s etymology : <PARA> whether a gratuity is legally enforceable is not part of any law we could find , but disputes over tipping can and do make their way to courtrooms , such as one instance in 2004 where a new york judge deemed such a charge unenforceable : <PARA> in 2009 , diners were arrested on a similar charge after refusing to pay a $ 16 service charge in pennsylvania . an aggrieved diner said that after she was subjected to excessive waits and had to fetch her own silverware and drink refills , she was not inclined to tip her server : <PARA> several days later , a judge sided with the diners and dropped the charges : <PARA> in some cases , judges have not sided with diners seeking an end to a mandatory gratuity , which became an issue when diner ted diamond sued darden restaurant group in 2013 : <PARA> a 2014 ruling favored darden restaurants in the suit : <PARA> further muddying the waters is that as of 1 january 2014 , the internal revenue service decided that any form of “ mandatory gratuity ” is paid not to the server but to the restaurant ( as a measure to ensure taxes are paid on tips ): <PARA> that creates a legal gray area , in which an objecting diner could potentially be arrested for theft of services for declining to pay the fee ( although the 2004 and 2009 cases came before the irs rule change ), and it is common for the issue to be parsed as one of taxation rather than obligation . ( although the irs classifies a “ service charge ” as taxable income , it did not extend its reach into the enforcement of such charges .) <PARA> the legality of enforcing mandatory surcharges , service fees , and tips appears to fluctuate from state to state , or even situation to situation . in many cases , the practice was upheld by the lack of laws forbidding it : <PARA> over the years , the subject of mandatory tips or service fees has been debated , legislated , argued in court , written about extensively , and addressed by the irs . most information on the topic was semantic , as nearly all case law we could find rested on whether a gratuity is a tip ( voluntary ) or a service fee ( potentially enforceable by law ). in many cases , restaurants impose such fees in the absence of laws prohibiting them . the firmest legal information on mandatory service fees comes from the irs , but that entity provides no guidance on whether the fee is legally enforceable .
true	examples : [ collected via e - mail , april 2013 ] <PARA> origins : dr . kermit gosnell is a philadelphia - area doctor who is currently on trial in pennsylvania , charged with a variety of crimes related to his performance of hundreds of illegal and gruesome late - term abortions . although dr . gosnell ’ s case has not yet been fully adjudicated , the grand jury report for his case prepared by district attorney r . seth williams is truly a horrifying read , stating ( in part ) that : <PARA> the clinic reeked of animal urine , courtesy of the cats that were allowed to roam ( and defecate ) freely . furniture and blankets <PARA> were stained with blood . instruments were not properly sterilized . disposable medical supplies were not disposed of ; they were <PARA> reused , over and over again . medical equipment — such as the defibrillator , the ekg , the pulse oximeter , the blood pressure cuff — was generally broken ; even when it worked , it wasn ’ t used . the emergency exit was padlocked shut . and scattered throughout , in cabinets , in the basement , in a freezer , in jars and bags and plastic jugs , were fetal remains . it was a baby charnel house . the people who ran this sham medical practice included no doctors other than gosnell himself , and not even a single nurse . two of his employees had been to <PARA> medical school , but neither of them were licensed physicians . they just pretended to be . everyone called them “ doctor ,” even though they , and gosnell , knew they weren ’ t . among the rest of the staff , there was no one with any medical licensing or relevant certification at all . but that didn ’ t stop them from making diagnoses , performing procedures , administering drugs . <PARA> gosnell ’ s approach , whenever possible , was to force full labor and delivery of premature infants on ill - informed women . the women would check in during the day , make payment , and take labor - inducing drugs . the doctor wouldn ’ t appear until evening , often 8 : 00 , 9 : 00 , or 10 : 00 p . m ., and only then deal with any of the women who were ready to deliver . many of them gave birth before he even got there . <PARA> by maximizing the pain and danger for his patients , he minimized the work , and cost , for himself and his staff . the policy , <PARA> in effect , was labor without labor . there remained , however , a final difficulty . when you perform late - term “ abortions ” by inducing labor , you get babies . live , breathing , squirming babies . by 24 weeks , most babies born prematurely will survive if they receive appropriate medical care . but that was not what the [ clinic ] was about . gosnell had a simple solution for the unwanted babies he delivered : he killed them . he didn ’ t call it that . he called it “ ensuring fetal demise .” the way he ensured fetal demise was by sticking scissors into the back of the baby ’ s neck and cutting the spinal cord . he called that “ snipping .” <PARA> over the years , there were hundreds of “ snippings .” sometimes , if gosnell was unavailable , the “ snipping ” was done by one of his fake doctors , or even by one of the administrative staff . <PARA> but all the employees of the women ’ s medical society knew . everyone there acted as if it wasn ’ t murder at all . most of these acts cannot be prosecuted , because gosnell destroyed the files . among the relatively few cases that could be specifically documented , one was baby boy a . his 17 - year - old mother was almost 30 weeks pregnant — seven and a half months — when labor was induced . an employee estimated his birth weight as approaching six pounds . he was breathing and moving when dr . gosnell severed his spine and put the body in a plastic shoebox for disposal . the doctor joked that this baby was so big he could “ walk me to the bus stop .” another , baby boy b , whose body was found at the clinic frozen in a one - gallon spring - water bottle , was at least 28 weeks of gestational age when he was killed . baby c was moving and breathing for 20 minutes before an assistant came in and cut the spinal cord , just the way she had seen gosnell do it so many times . and these were not even the worst cases . <PARA> after reviewing extensive and compelling evidence of criminal wrongdoing at the clinic , the grand jury has issued a presentment recommending the prosecution of gosnell and members of his staff for criminal offenses including : murder of karnamaya mongar , murders of babies born alive , infanticide , violations of the controlled substances act , hindering , obstruction , and tampering , perjury , illegal late - term abortions , violations of the abortion control act , violations of the controlled substances act , abuse of corpse , theft by deception , conspiracy , corrupt organization , corruption of minors . <PARA> some critics have maintained that dr . gosnell ’ s case has not received nearly as much attention in the u . s . news media as it merits . in a piece published on 11 april 2013 in usa today , for example , kirsten powers wrote : <PARA> it ’ s not your fault . since the murder trial of pennsylvania abortion doctor kermit gosnell began march 18 , there has been precious little coverage of the case that should be on every news show and front page . the revolting revelations of gosnell ’ s former staff , who have been testifying to what they witnessed and did during late - term abortions , should shock anyone with a heart . <PARA> a lexis - nexis search shows none of the news shows on the three major national television networks has mentioned the gosnell trial in the last three months . <PARA> the washington post has not published original reporting on this during the trial and the new york times saw fit to run one original story on a - 17 on the trial ’ s first day . they ’ ve been silent ever since , despite headline - worthy testimony . <PARA> let me state the obvious . this should be front page news . when rush limbaugh attacked sandra fluke , there was non - stop media hysteria . the venerable nbc nightly news ‘ brian williams intoned , “ a firestorm of outrage from women after a crude tirade from rush limbaugh ,” as he teased a segment on the brouhaha . yet , accusations of babies having their heads severed — a major human rights story if there ever was one — doesn ’ t make the cut . <PARA> you don ’ t have to oppose abortion rights to find late - term abortion abhorrent or to find the gosnell trial eminently newsworthy . this is not about being “ pro - choice ” or “ pro - life .” it ’ s about basic human rights . <PARA> the deafening silence of too much of the media , once a force for justice in america , is a disgrace . <PARA> the following day , conor friedersdorf responded in the atlantic to say that : <PARA> inducing live births and subsequently severing the heads of the babies is indeed a horrific story that merits significant attention . strange as it seems to say it , however , that understates the case . <PARA> for this isn ’ t solely a story about babies having their heads severed , though it is that . it is also a story about a place where , according to the grand jury , women were sent to give birth into toilets ; where a doctor casually spread gonorrhea and chlamydiae to unsuspecting women through the reuse of cheap , disposable instruments ; an office where a 15 - year - old administered anesthesia ; an office where former workers admit to playing games when giving patients powerful narcotics ; an office where white women were attended to by a doctor and black women were pawned off on clueless untrained staffers . any single one of those things would itself make for a blockbuster news story . is it even conceivable that an optometrist who attended to his white patients in a clean office while an intern took care of the black patients in a filthy room wouldn ’ t make national headlines ? <PARA> but it isn ’ t even solely a story of a rogue clinic that ’ s awful in all sorts of sensational ways either . multiple local and state agencies are implicated in an oversight failure that is epic in proportions ! if i were a city editor for any philadelphia newspaper the grand jury report would suggest a dozen major investigative projects i could undertake if i had the staff to support them . and i probably wouldn ’ t have the staff . but there is so much fodder for additional reporting . <PARA> there is , finally , the fact that abortion , one of the most hotly contested , polarizing debates in the country , is at the center of this case . it arguably informs the abortion debate in any number of ways , and has numerous plausible implications for abortion policy , including the oversight and regulation of clinics , the appropriateness of late - term abortions , the penalties for failing to report abuses , the statute of limitations for killings like those with which gosnell is charged , whether staff should be legally culpable for the bad behavior of doctors under whom they work ... <PARA> there ’ s just no end to it . <PARA> to sum up , this story has numerous elements any one of which would normally make it a major story . and setting aside conventions , which are flawed , this ought to be a big story on the merits . <PARA> the news value is undeniable . <PARA> david weigel weighed in on the controversy in slate , reporting that : <PARA> let ’ s just state the obvious : national political reporters are , by and large , socially liberal . we are more likely to know a gay couple than to know someone who owns an “ assault weapon .” we are , generally , pro - choice . there is a bubble . horror stories of abortionists are less likely to permeate that bubble than , say , a story about a right - wing pundit attacking an abortionist who then claims to have gotten death threats . <PARA> so the question , raised by pro - lifers , is this : explain to us why gosnell isn ’ t a national story . somebody else can try . i can ’ t explain it . it ’ s never made sense to me , how a local crime story becomes a national story . two words : “ poop cruise .” cnn ran hours of coverage and grainy video of a stranded carnival cruise ship , a situation that inconvenienced many and killed none . how does a missing college student or an angry man in a tsa line become part of our national conversation ? i don ’ t know . <PARA> if you ’ re pro - choice , say , and you worry that the gosnell story is being promoted only to weaken your cause , you really should read the grand jury report . “ doh could and should have closed down gosnell ’ s clinic years before ,” write the investigators . why wasn ’ t it ? were state regulators nervous about igniting a political fight about abortion ? is the regulatory system incompetent or under - funded ? and are there other states where the same could be said ? social conservatives are largely right about the gosnell story . maybe it ’ s not a raw political story . it ’ s just the story of a potential mass murderer who operated for decades as government regulators did nothing . <PARA> irin carmon countered claims of media non - coverage in salon , asserting that : <PARA> paul farhi also observed in the washington post that : <PARA> the weekly standard and the national review , two leading conservative magazines , for example , hadn ’ t published anything on the trial , according to a search of the nexis database . the new york post ’ s conservative editorial board has written one commentary — an editorial lamenting the lack of coverage , which , although it doesn ’ t mention it , includes its own paper . the washington times has published five staff - written articles and guest commentaries on the matter , all focusing on the absence of press coverage . <PARA> fox news has been the only consistent national tv source on the story , having run 11 news reports or commentaries on it over the past month . among national print outlets , the associated press has covered the trial extensively . the story has been prominently featured in the huffington post and discussed on its huffington post live webcast . the huffington post is generally considered a liberal news organization .
