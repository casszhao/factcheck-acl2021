1	appearance : cloudy and blonde . nice head with fine bubbles .	000000000000
0	a : pours a cloudy bronze with a bubbly tan head	00000000000
1	appearance : this may be the prettiest beer i have ever seen . at first glance i think it might be a rootbeer ( pouring dark brown , almost black ) , but the beautiful dark tan head gives it away as a radiant porter .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : beautiful looking pour with fluffy white head and nice lacing . hazy orange to lighter orange on the edges . pretty .	000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours into a sam adams glass the deepest of dark browns . a beige , one-finger-high head forms and takes its good old time to drop down . it eventually settles out to a full covering on the surface .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : it pours a deep and dark red with nice amber hues . with about one inch of head that is foamy and a little lacey . bubbles rise up from the depths to keep the head from thinning out to quickly . aromas : nice hop notes hints of allspice and nutmeg . mild hints of roasted malts .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dark brown almost amberish in color . white head , little head retention .	0000000000000000
1	a : enormous head from a fairly gentle pour . head fills the glass to the top , sticks around forever and leaves tons of lace . wow ! beer is black and stout like .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : this poured a nearly opaque pinkish red , with a bit of white head . not the prettiest beer , but whatever .	0000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : gushed upon opening , but poured out and settled just fine . a dark brown pour yields a medium , foamy looking tan head with decent retention . head fades down to a ring with touches of wisp on top . black body , opaque , with medium carbonation evident . only a ring remains but leaves no real lacing down the glass . nothing special about the 10 . however , the 09 was much more impressive , with a darker , thicker pour and a more persistent mocha colored head that left some nice lacing down the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : half finger head of no cream at all , bad thickness ( i.e . it 's thin ) , and terrible retention . clear yellow colour . sm : stale lemon esters and bad barley . a light scent ( thankfully ) .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a light amber , with no read head . does n't look like much .	00000000000000000
1	appearance : deep brown , nearly black at times , with dull ruby highlights . on top , a decent off-white head that leaves little lacing .	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : glorious deep red color with no head . looks like cranberry juice . that sounds bad but this beer looked great .	000000000000000000000000

1	a : 1 1/2 '' light brown head that left a very nice lacing over black liquid . very tempting looking stout .	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : ludicrously bubbling ; ember rattlesnake shine ; its head ripples convergingly to the surface where it never does once , lose its cool .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : half finger head of slight cream , crap thickness , and poor retention . dark murky yellow colour . sm : lemon esters and caramelized malt . a light scent .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours an opaque black with a rich almond brown head . a very well retained head with good lacing sticking to the edge of the glass . flavor : burnt coffee and dark chocolate flavors hit your tongue immediately with a creamy sweet backdrop . this follows with a peppery presence as well through the middle that is almost burning . this spice backs up the coffee and chocolate sweetness well . finish is of bitter dark chocolate and is probably the only area where an earthy hop bitterness is present .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : the slightest bit cloudy amber with a small , fast-fading head which was completely gone after a few sips ; then it looked like i was drinking an iced tea .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : super pitch black with no light shining through . a thick 1 and 1/2 inch dark mocha colored head that fades at a decent pace . perfect !	000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : poured extremely dark brown ( almost black ) with a thick tan head .	0000000000000000
0	a : it pours almost cola brown with dark amber fringes . appears heavily carbonated . there is a generous tan head that looks very creamy . it gradually dissipated to about 1/8 '' . there was minimal to no lacing present .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : standard pour yields no head except for a slight ring of off-white , light brown foam atop a cloudy , dark , purplish-brown beer . no lacing . rather shabby looking in all three aspects but not quite off-putting .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this is one of the prettiest beers i 've seen , a dark red amber with a good amount of little bubbles feeding a big head .	00000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : a hazy , apricot-colored body capped by a finger of bubbly off-white head that burns off quickly and leaves only bare patches of lacing .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a one finger head of no cream , quite thin , and of bad retention . colour is a clear yellow . sm : caramelized malt is all me broken nose picks up ; all apologies , lads .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a clear golden color with a big , rocky head that is most impressive and leaves plenty of lace	0000000000000000000000
1	a : it looks good , looks like a stout . black , pours a nice tan-ish/light-brown head , with a bit of thickness to it .	000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a two finger extra creamy head into my guinness tulip . extra dark and black as the night , with a slight ruby hue if you force light through this one . the head slowly dissipates to a one finger head after a minute or two , clinging to the glass . massive lacing . the head sticks around , looks like a stout should .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy with a perfectly white head and small bubbles . there was nice retention , however , no lacing .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this beer was a light , golden yellow . much lighter than i was anticipating . even with a careful pour , there was a decent amount of sediment that made it into the glass . the head rose up perfectly to two fingers and settled down very , very slowly . this was mainly due to the absolutely huge amount of bubbles ( caused by the sediment ) that was rising up from below and feeding it . the head was sticky , and became dense and fluffy as is dissipated . there was a ton of lace left behind , creating solid sheets of foam on the side of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : this beer poured a hazy , golden yellow . the pure white head rose up easily and was very dense and lightly fluffy . a very heavy bead fed it from below and caused it to linger for a long , long time . a think cap of foam still remained as i drained the glass it was sticky and clung to the side of the glass as it dissipated , pretty much coating it solidly . as i drank , the lacing was very heavy and left lovely rings down the length of the glass . i love it when that happens .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : looks quite nice- crystal-clear golden color with a large , foamy white head that dissipates slowly and leaves behind spotty lace .	000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours with a half finger of air filed head that does not sustain at all and barely laces . the beer itself is a cloudy orange tinted yellow . the carbonation on this beer also seems a bit excessive , which leaves me wondering how the heck did the head disappear so fast .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : poured from a wonderfully nostalgic can into a standard pint glass . although i ca n't do a side-by-side comparison , this beer looks slightly more amber than keystone but not as dark as bud . boo for that . on the plus side , the head has some lacing . what the fuck is that ? ! ? ! ? !	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a cloudy , spiced apple cider color with highlites of salmon and orange . fantastic pillowy white head is holding its own ... clinging to the side like its life was depending on it . the head has remained a solid presence through the beer all the way to the last sip .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : head retention poor , lagery yellow colour , sticky chemicalish lacing . does n't look much chop next to the cooper 's pale ale beside it .	00000000000000000000000000000

0	a : deep amber hue , very little lacing .	0000000000
0	appearance : umm ... i think my beer is broken . it did n't produce any head . i 'm dead serious , not even a single layer of bubbles , so pretty much lacing and retention are non-factors . the body is a nice blonde colour , but there is quite a lot of thin sediment hanging around the body . i 'm not impressed at all .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a maroon body that leans more toward the brown side . a light haziness to it . it 's capped by a small off-white head . not much in the way of lace . the bottle had solid chunks in it ( cherry skins ? ) that can only be called `` disgusting .

0	appearance : a very hazy , copper colored beer . i spaced off for a second while pouring and unleashed a ton of sediment into my glass , so that did n't help the clarity . the head was a cream color and disappeared quickly . the lace was minimal .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours black with a creamy full yellow-tan head , thick lace .	00000000000000

0	appearance : pours clear light copper with literally no head .	00000000000
0	appearance : served in a small ( 8oz ) glass . a light wisp of cappuccino-colored head quickly dissipated into the watery black body of this beer . all in all , like a waifish japanese supermodel , this beer looks a little more light-bodied than it should be .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : slightly hazy golden straw with a super fizzy and tightly packed bleached white head . there is no head retention and no lacing to speak of after a few minutes though .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : copper brown , fluffy cream head with great lacing .	000000000000

1	a : dark amber color , too hazy to see through . darker where the foam is . finger-width head dissipates to leave behind some lacing .	000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : hazy yellowish copper with tight , rocky , eggshell-colored head . so far ( 2-3 minutes after pour ) , head has dropped from two fingers to about one and left thick cobweb-like lacing in its wake . a good smattering of bubbles can be seen rising through the haze . midway through , the lacing is tremendous ; a cloudy time-line of session thus far .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : hazy copper/red body with absolutely no head whatsoever . no lacing , no retention - horrible looking beer . and there 's really not much else to say about it than that . this is going to be flat .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a red copper color - not much head - what little is there is small taupey bubbles . there is a lot of sediment floating around in the glass which made me give it a lower rating .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : creamy frothy white head with excellent retention . almost missed my plane waiting for the head to subside . the color is a beautiful golden yellow to orange gradient , lighter at the slimmer parts of the glass and darker towards the top . rich , radiant and glowing . s &	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : this is a really good looking beer , if for no other reason than it 's ruby red color , it 's nice head retention , and its uniqueness -- not many other beers have color like this .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : deep hazy red pour with a small tan head that did n't last .	0000000000000000

0	a : pours a slightly hazy gold , thin film of white head , zero retention , some lacing	0000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a luscious red hued amber beer with a massive clumpy , lumpy frothy , patchy off-white head that sticks to the glass and wo n't go away .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark amber body with a decent size head that 's bubbly and long lasting .	0000000000000000000
1	a : pitch black . i guess the head 's lighter than some beers of this style , but its off-white qualities just remind the drinker of its unique astringency . the beer itself would struggle to reveal itself in even the most gothic of settings . completely . black .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pale yellow and clear with a very frothy off-white head that hung around quite a while . noted numerous cloudy flakes floating around in every bottle , not appealing .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark golden red with a thick , creamy , foamy white head . visible carbonation in the glass and good lacing . this is a really nice looking beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : fizzy yellow beer color ( less yellow and fizzy than michelob ultra ) thin highly carbonated white head specks of lacing form after dwindling in seconds after the pour .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : deep cherrywood , with minimal carbonation and very nice clarity . soapy tan head does n't stick very long and only leaves bits and pieces of lace . this is definitely the beer 's weak spot .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a deep , dark , coffee brown/black . residing on top is the most amazing three fingers of dark khaki brown head that i think i 've ever seen . retention was incredible in that it never completely recedes . multiple gobs , splatters , and tendrils of lace were left to coat the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : black in colour with ruby hues , lace is tan and sticks a bit .	00000000000000000
1	appearance : good lord , this does not look like a porter ! black-hole like blackness , no highlights , no edges , no nothing ! i would have said this is a 10-15 % imperial stout . how on earth do they get a 6 % beer this black ? a rough pour yields a large mocha coloured head that lasts really well and leaves great lace . if the appearance is anything to go by this is going to be a stunning beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : slightly hazy golden amber . decent 1 finger , light , off-white colored head . minimal lacing .	00000000000000000000
0	a : pours murky brown in color with a noticeable dirt-like sediment falling out of the bottom of the bottle . a super fizzy surface coating quickly recedes to the sides of the glass . there is no lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : cracked open and thrown into a most appropriate dfh snifter.crystal clear ruby/garnet colour with a moderate head that dissapates quickly . little islands of bubbles struggle to stay afloat . looks very nice the way the light strikes it .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy golden color with little head retention , appears to be somewhat fluffy . surprised to see the color is so light and golden , almost appears to be a common german weizen in appearance .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : this is most likely the worst looking beer , stylistically , i 've ever seen from bell 's . the head is pretty much non-existent and there is no lacing . on a wheat type of beer this is something that really bothers me . color is cloudy amber with lemon yellow highlights .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : loud pop upon uncapping . a light brown head rises to 4 fingers with a texture transforming from compact foam to bubble bath . the head fills with pockets of air as the larger bubbles pop and temporarily increases the rate of deflation . the length of retention overall is above average however . the body is really dark brown , almost completely opaque and reveals some deep amber tints only when held to light . small light colored flecks of sediment can be seen at the bottom of the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : this beer is really carbonated . the first thing you notice are the bubbles which continue to rise for minutes after pouring . colour is a strange , almost sickly , yellow . not entirely pleasant .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours black as midnight on a moonless night . i can see my reflection in the glass . tan head is luxuriously thick and foamy , shrinking from two fingers to half a finger over the course of a couple minutes .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : looked exactly like pineapple juice with a particular and intriguing yellow color . small head that managed to stay on for a while . little to no lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a nice , natural hazy orange . little lacing is a creamy white .	0000000000000000
1	appearance : pretty much flawless . i love that pinkish orangey color .	0000000000000
1	a : pours a decent 1 finger airy head that diminishes semi quickly , but somewhat holds up well due to the bubbles rising from the bottom thanks to the etch in the glass . its a crystal clear pale amber orange color , almost a perfect color for an apa . n : some light hops tickle nose . a slight noble hop aroma , with some grassy effects , and very light hints of citrus . a slight malty aroma also comes through . very light on the nose , and almost impossible to detect .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : cloudy dark mahogony and slight head	00000000
1	a : vibrant cherry red . two finger tan head recedes quickly but lacing starts right away and does n't go away . somehow these colors look amazing . lots of sediment , tiny little floaties .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : as usual , one of the only fun beers to watch in the glass as golden and brown cascading bubbles hypnotically draw you in . dense and smooth mocha colored head well into the two-finger rule . good head retention and laced followed only from where i drank at first and then dispersed to coat the walls of the glass	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a murky , medium brown body with a small , unassuming , white head .	000000000000000000
1	a : 3/4 finger pure white head . cloudy bright yellow with gold core ! this is definitely a belgian white from the master !	0000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : the beer really looked good in the glass . the beer has a clear golden/ amber coloration . the tight carbonation practically boils . the head was a creamy biege color two fingers high . the head never went down on the beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : murky light amber color with lots of yeast floating about . thin , off-white head that dissipates quickly . nothing special about the appearance .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured from a twist-off 12 oz bottle into a pint glass . no head retention at all , golden color , more of the 'honey ' color than the 'brown ' which i at least thought would show up .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : hazed orange amber with small flakes of sediment floating around , head retention is quite eye appealing with a dense rocky start after the pouring then subsiding to a sticky lace .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a cloudy light yellow , with a pretty thick head at first , not long lasting , no lacing .	00000000000000000000000

0	appearance : pours a one finger , medium-thinner looking , off-white head with decent retention . head is kind of bubbly and chunky , slowly fading to a bubbly wisp and leaving some immediate chunky lacing on the glass . a cloudy burnt orange with no carbonation evident . a splotchy wisp and ring remain leaving dots of lacing down the glass . starts out lousy , but finishes up strong .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy light orange body with a finger of frothy white head . ok retention and lacing for the serving method , but no better than average overall .	000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours a pretty cloudy orange-juice color with a big fluffy white creamy looking head on top that is a solid inch and looks like it has no intention of going anywhere . there are tons of bubbles rising , so the head could n't leave if it wanted to . after the head finally starts to fall and you drink some of the beer , the liquid starts to clear up some and there is some solid lacing left on the glass . this has turned out to be a pretty nice looking beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : after requiring a crab claw to grip this bitch of a cork and pull out , i finally pop this one only to find the beer does not even toot out the tip of this cork . so i pour it , then it lands in the glass , rolls around and simply sits . no bubbles . no head . i can get a nice reddish brown color when light comes through .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : it looks cool , and the appearance is still the worst part of this beer . cloudy like a homebrew gone wrong , but an interesting peach color nonetheless . this is n't what beer usually looks like . huge , sexy , frothy head that gets cloudy and chunky as it settles .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : i loved the appearance . it was poured from the bottle into a schneider weisse 0,5 l hefeweizen glass . very cloudy and a nice golden orange glow with a white frothy head that quickly dissipated . this is organic and unfiltered and it showed . it gave the look of a thick , refreshing hefeweizen . unfortunately , for me this category gets the highest rating .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : poured from the 1pt. , 9oz bottle into an imperial pint . the beer is a clear dark brown with a one finger , white head that dissipated fairly quickly .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : it was a bit hard to tell since the place was very dark but this beer has some dark brown tones decorated by glowing red areas on the sides and the bottom . beatiful three finger tanned head that refused to disappear . some lacing present .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : after pouring this beer , i noticed that it had a blondish straw colour with a healthy amount of carbonation ( at first ) and a very tall ( yet short lived ) head . later on there was a bit of noticable lacing on the glass . not terribly appealing visualy and not worthy of a lager title !	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : somewhat hazy reddish purple , no head to speak of . looks like a glass of cherry juice .	000000000000000000000
0	appearance : reddish amber mug shows great clarity , but the head collapses pretty quickly to a very thin cover . flavor : balance is toward the malt but only with a light sweetness . nutty character in the aftertaste with just a little yeast bite .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : purple colored brew with a fizzy , beet colored head . a bit strange to look at .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : a nice solid dark tan head but the retention is not the greatest . the body of the beer is opaque . the clarity of the beer is nonexistent . there are garnet highlights .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : bright copper color , a few bubbles , the foamy head lives for 15 seconds , after white burrs reamin on the surface , without lacing obviously , i like the logo with a bighorn sheep ;	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours with a two finger thick , off-white and chunky head . the beer is clear , bright , deep amber with small bubble streams raising to the top - an attractive beer to look at . suds rings form through the duration of the drink , leaving a hard crusty film on my imperial pint glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : jet black , with a nice creamy head .	00000000000
0	a : poured thick and slow . i drank this back to back with a rogue shakespeare stout and it was basically like comparing water to whole milk . the head rose quickly and bubbles away to a thin mocha film in about 30 seconds .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : rocky head that settles to a thin head with nice lacing .	00000000000000

1	a : 1 '' tan head with decent retention and lacing . near black body .	0000000000000000
1	appearance : very dark and menacing , yet i got a nice little fluffy amount of tan head on this guy on an aggressive pour . pretty slick looking as i 'm not getting much lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a cloudy orange/amber color . a surprisingly small white head forms and recedes in a second . no lace is left either .	00000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a full three inch head that persisted with some lacing . evenly clouded yellow-white . fairly carbonated .	00000000000000000000
0	a : bright copper body topped with a small loose had that quickly dissipates leaving no lacing and only a ring of cover around the edge . nothing special .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a nice tangerine-orange body with a slight haziness to it . head is bubbly , white , long lasting , and leaves a heavy amount of lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : florescent golden yellow with white head that quickly fades to a thin sheet . very bubbly . not impressive .	0000000000000000000000

0	appearance : pours a very hazy and golden body . color resembles a pear . fairly average head that recedes quite quickly and no much lacing to speak of . not too nice , i was expecting more .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : light , even for the style .	000000000

0	a : no head , no lacing , no sediment , but the absolutely beautiful dark ruby red coloring brought it up from a lower score .	000000000000000000000000000

1	a : poured impressively opaque black into a standard pint glass . thick , marshmallow head that looks like it could be placed on top of any dessert . this is what i 'm talking about .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : no faults in appearance .	0000000
1	a : 12oz bottle that says i should have used it by october 2006 . oops ? looks like beery root beer . deep red-brown with a yellowed head and lots of particulate matter . i 'm anticipating a good beer , but it looks a bit sickly .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : the beer poured with a solid thumb of head , but it does not lace , nor does it retain very well . the beer itself shows quite a bit of carbonation although it is hard to tell , given the murky yellow color of the beer that shows hints of green when put up to the light .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : opaque black pour with a beautiful one and a half finger chocolate milk colored head . the retention and lacing is wonderful , this is how a beer should look ! 5	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark copper with one finger light tan head that dwindles to a spotted surface of foam before collapsing into nothing .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : nothing surprising about the pour on this one -- pale , pale yellow in color , almost clear with no head retention whatsoever .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : watery straw yellow	00000
0	a : a weak classic yellow with course , quick head that smartly reduces down to a large island with a ring . unimpressive .	0000000000000000000000000

1	a : a pale straw , very clear beer with high carbonation , but with some sediment appearing after the slow pour . i say slow pour because that is the only way to pour this beer , which forms an absolutely enormous , white head even with a very gentle pour and even when chilled down . the head actually continues to expand for a few moments after pouring is complete , and then slowly collapses into a large-bubbled foam similar to the cap on an over-frothed latte . eventually , the head dissipates to a loose bead on the top of the beer . surprisingly , lacing is only moderate . a beautiful beer to look at .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a thick , opaque chocolate brown , like liquid `` chocolate chunk . '' wispy tan head with thick lacing . a good-looking stout !	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : deep brown , nearly black in color . rough pour yielded a thin light brown head that dissipated quickly with very little lacing .	00000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : lovely golden-amber body with a touch of haze and a parchment-colored , medium-sized head with average retention .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : a thin white ring around the glass . the ring around the glass is foamy . the color of the beer is an amber color with some copper hues . the clarity of the beer is clear to brilliant . there is a good amount of effervescence in the beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : hazy copper without much lacing and only a half finger head smell/taste : very bready , with a hint of poms and apricots mouthfeel/drinkability : medium bodied , and could drink this all day .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a clear yellow gold color with a 1/2 '' of creamy white foam on top after a pretty quick pour . there are numerous bubbles rising to maintain the head , so it does n't look that much different after a minute . there is some solid chunks of lace left on the glass after drinking .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this was either amazing , or my eyes were playing tricks on me . poured black with a tan head that diminishes quickly . also had a a nice red tint to it , depending on the angle i used to look . what i found most amazing , is that it seemed to give off a purplish/blueish hue . if the head stayed around longer , this would easily have been the perfect appearance .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : not much to see here . golden brew with little to no head to speak of . looks very plain , but makes up for it elsewhere .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : golden yellow , very clear , white head with little lacing	0000000000000
1	appearance : surprisingly nice head , a creamy meringue-white , light and soft with fairly good retention . body is a pale , clear , brassy dandelion color .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours black with a thick , syrup consistency . the head is a beautiful tan color and is prominent . very prominent . in fact , its been sitting for about 10 minutes now and theres still about a half inch on there . i could lay on it like a pillow . mmm , maybe next time .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : extremely golden color . have n't seen any beers as bright as this one . murky and cloudy with little to no head .	00000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : when poured into a standard american pint glass , this maibock is a clear honey amber color . at first glance , it looked like it was going to have a 1 1/2 inch head of white fizzy bubbles . that changed after it quickly fizzled away into an island of white fizzy bubbles , 4 white fizzy rings around the glass , and no lace . it would have been better if the head of foam bothered to stick around , but i ca n't have everything .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : clear brown , looks like tea .	000000000
1	appearance : immense carbonation forms a massive white head , humungous in size ; it meant that the first pour was short lived as the head filled most of my glass . incredible staying power ensures that head is long lived . it slowly collapses to reveal a rocky white pot-holed surface with some sticky lacing . a golden blonde body is festooned with fast rising streamers . looks superb !	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : as poured the beer is a nice clear russet color with a 1 and `` foamy cream colored head that recedes fairly soon to leave a 1/8 '' cap on the liquid with lots of lacing speckles and patches on the glass . eventually the cap becomes an island of foam and a prominent ring around the glass . sipping leaves a nice pattern of leggy and speckled lacing . even to the end of the beer there is a ring of foam and lacing sticking to the sides of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : well after about ten minutes i wrestled the cork out of this small green bottle and i was surprised to not hear much of a pop noise or any kind of hissing . tonight i pulled out another one of my favorite snifter 's , my troegs mad elf christmas glass and i poured ever so carefully because i noticed there was a hefty amount of yeast on the bottom of the bottle and i did n't want to get any in my glass . i guess i spoke too soon on the pour , no matter how gentle i titled the bottle and the glass there was just massive amounts of yeast chunks coming out ( see photo ) . now , this is n't a terrible thing and wo n't impart any taste it just knocks the appearance down a few points . this beer poured a murky reddish brown with a nice thick bone white head about two fingers thick , and aside the chunks in the bottom of my glass this looks real nice .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours a beautiful chocolate brown with a large thick light brown head in my sa bl glass . the retention on that thick foam a-top my beer is nothing less than impressive . i had to impatiently stick my nose through the heavy foam . eventually it recedes and leaves the walls of the glass plastered with sheets of lace .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a dark ruby that fades to a medium orange-brown around the edges of the bottom . three fingers of caramel cappuccino foam sit on top fading ever so slowly . lacing abounds around the sides of the glass . this is my first trippelbock , so i do n't really have a basis for comparison , but it looks pretty freaking amazing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : really cool . neon yellow and very brilliant . lacing and foam are just ok .	000000000000000000
0	appearance : well , this beer has head that both laces and retains like crazy . this of course must lead to why i 'm giving it such a low score . the amount of sediment and particles in this beer is outright revolting . the are dark brown particles in the head , and there are pieces ; yes pieces of what looks to be dissolved bread in the beer itself . it 's so bad , it 's hard to even notice the out of control carbonation . seriously , this would be a 1 , if the head was n't so impressive and even then , i 'm half tempted to anyways . if the bottle itself was n't wrapped in foil , i 'd suspect some form of product tampering .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : crystal clear , straw colored , streams of champagne bubbles and a thick creamy head , great retention , rings of foamy lace	0000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a gusher . pours a very large 3+ finger medium-thin fluffy tan head . head slowly snap , crackles and pops its way down to decent film head . black with almost no carbonation evident . a wisp remains until the end but leaves no lacing down the glass . the beginning of the experience , what with the gushing and the thin crackly head , left a little to be desired . i do n't like hearing my beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : served up an obscured , strawberry sherbet-hued body with a slim , fine , but persistent white head .	000000000000000000000
0	appearance : i 've tired this beer in a few bottles , but it fairs best in a tall , narrow , fluted pilsner glass . that way you can generate a nice head and lacing . in a fluted pilsner you can get a nice 2 finger head that leaves a little residue once the head dissipates into the lacing . the lacing is thin and soapy at best . the color is a clear golden yellow . a small column of bubbles float to the top , however not in rapid succession or in great quantity as they do in some pilsners .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a very pitch black color with a brown head that is only a quarter inch high . it shows no sign of head retention . in fact , the head quickly disappears and does n't leave anything on the glass or on the miniscus .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : looked downright sinister following the pour ; pitch black ( opaque ) body with a brown , bubbly crown that retained well and drug tons of web-like lace . looked pretty hearty too ! right on the money style-wise .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a deep wooden amber with a couple fingers of greasy dark tan head that took its time fading into a thick film that left a sheet of fuzzy lacing down the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a very dark brown with a tan had that recedes into a slight halo .	000000000000000000
0	appearance : medium head that faded to a surface coating with lacing that hangs on . color is lighter than a copper color very much like a traditional pilsner with lots of bubbles .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a beautiful beer . pours a deep , slightly cloudy amber with a one finger white head . although the head is n't huge , the retention is off the charts . lacing is also very impressive-almost like soap . i sipped this beer over the course of an hour or so and the top of the glass was still thick with foam .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : poured very similar to a flat bottle of bourbon angel share ... sorry lost abbey . lol . no head , no lacing ... no real excitement going on with the look . when i held it up to the light , i was able to find this solid black mass surrounded by this lighter brown liquid ... similar to miso soup .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : perfectly clear , big rocky head , light copper color .	0000000000000

1	a : deep crimson with a quickly fading off but persistent white head . gorgeous !	0000000000000000
0	a : this one pours black from the bottle into my pint glass with not much light breaking through . tan head is quick to settle and never developed much .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : bit of macro head on the get go but then the head disappears altogether , maybe the pepper in the bottle causes this ? no lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : deep brownish red colour w/ no head .	0000000000

1	appearance : pours with 2 fingers of off white head with an almost yellow tint , possibly from the beer below it . this settles slowly into a thin coating of foam , but leaving behind probably 80 % coverage of white , sticky lacing . the beer itself is medium yellow and cloudy . because of the suspended yeast , it reflects light and almost has a glow of its own . pretty cool . no sediment in the bottle , but i did swirl the last bit .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : actually poured a nice dark brown almost black as the name suggests . when held to the light it allows a nice amber hued light to come through . has a nice off white head that diminishes to a top cap that produces some nice lacing . good looking beer , kinda suprising .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : poured into a duvel sniffter and a la fin du monde when the head went wild ; this head just went crazy from the start , gurgling out the bottle while lightly pouring ... what settled down was a clear orange gold with incredible meringue like head and excellent lacing and rentention ... i 'm lucky i had and extra glass hanging around .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : frothy 1 finger head that keeps its worth with all the bubbles rising from the bottom of my etched sa pint glass . brilliantly crystal clear toasty amber brown color with a golden hue . it even leaves a slight lacing on the glass . n : lots of bready malts really dominate . some light lager aromas with yeasty smells . a slight toasty malt , and some syrupy sweet malts and hints of lighter fruits .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : hazy orange amber tone with an off white cream head leaves minimal lacing .	0000000000000000
0	appearance : the color is great - a beautiful deep coppery brown , kind of like coke . light carbonation can be seen rising to the top . light brown , fluffy 2-finger head fades incredibly fast to a skim on the top . not much lacing throughout , sadly .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : 3 fingers of off-white head . reddish-amber color ... clear ... beautiful-looking beer . really well-put-together -- just wish the taste matched the looks .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : slightly cloudy , zero head . with the added protein from the wheat , there should really be some head here ?	000000000000000000000000

0	a : black with red hues , it seems undercarbonated with a thin collar and a quick head .	0000000000000000000
0	a : this is , without a doubt , the worst looking beer i have ever seen . it pours a murky puce color with a ring of off-white head around the edge of the glass . i 'm not judging a book by it 's cover though .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : even if this beer were n't infected -- and i knew it was , because short 's was on the label -- the appearance would be awful . floating chunks of ... what the hell is this ? ! ? ! flakes of marshmallow ? it 's completely unappealing to the eye .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : cloudy , sediment filled belgian looking yellow with an ample head and slight lacing . not the prettiest start . n : this is where things look up . citrus and a boatload of creamy ripe bananas . a bit of coriander with some hop aromas . the yeast and the wheat smells really are resounding for such a pale looking 'belgian ' .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : incredibly dark with a super jet black appearance that was quiet beguiling and attracted much attention , for it had the darkest of head that i had ever seen . when immediately poured the cascading head that was slowly forming and settling down was the self same color as the rest of the body , namely pure black . solid levels of carbonation and a very impressive imposing presentation at first that portrayed a dangerous sinister aspect to this imperial stout - building up its reputation long before i even got to drink it . the head eventually settled to a very dark cocoa brown rim that had a decent consistency and staying power .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : this brew pours a murky medium honey color . head is slight with minimal lacings . spiderwebbing was plentiful on the surface . interesting but not excellent .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this poured beautifully with a heavy full head colored orange/tan . the head stays forever and compliments the reddish tint found at the bottem and ages of the glass from the main brew .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a one finger head of slight cream , fair thickness , and bad retention . colour is a dark auburn . sm : amber hops is all me broken nose picks up . a moderate strength aroma .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : good and golden , although hazy . not much head .	0000000000000
1	a : pours a clearish deep amber , with a finger or so of light tan head . pretty good retention and not bad lacing , as it keeps a layer on the surface for a while . it looks very nice .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured a hazy reddish brown with a 3/4 in light tan head that stayed awhile . heavy lacing all over the glass .	0000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a nice fluffy medium-thick looking 2+ finger white head with great retention . quite a bit of carbonation evident and quite a few floaties as well . colour is a nice tangerine or orange peel orange and is pretty opaque . head eventually levels out to a thick cap and leaves immediate lacing . a decent cap remains the whole way down and leaves lots of nice lacing the whole way . ca n't imagine it getting any better than this .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : very pale yellow , more so than molson in my opinion . also lots of carbonation at first , then it goes away .	00000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : light brown with excellent and translucent clarity . pours a rich and fluffy off-white head , like the color of latte foam . the head holds very well throughout the glass and forms a nice lacing along the sides . the color is only slightly darker than the brown bottle it resides in . flavor : the aroma of coffee follows into the flavor as expected , but also at the forefront on the tongue is a light but easily detectable roasted quality that is drying and slightly bitter . hop bitterness follows this up with an earthy bite through the middle before the beer fades quickly to a clean finish .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : it has a very beautiful amber brown color , and it is crystal clear . the head pours on about 1 1/2 fingers and stays up pretty well . lots of visible carbonation . not much lacing on the glass . i give it a 5 because it has perfect color and clarity for a brown ale .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : not quiet black , but some brown around the edges . that distinct cascading effect is present . a good 2 finger white head forms that coats the glass with lace .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : looks the way beer should look..well at least a blond ale should look , blonde with 1 '' white head . is pretty thick at first but settles steadily .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a beautiful hazelnut ale with exceptional clarity . 2 fingers of peanut skin skin foam falls soo slow and even then leaves a wonderful stack of quilted equivalence of the same . near sheet lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dark espresso brown . a very hard pour , however , results in very minimal bubbles . looks like there 's a significant carbonation issue with this one . flavor : nice , sweet milk chocolate , some tootsie roll , and a vinous note . bitterness is enough to provide a little bit of balance , but does not hang on through the finish .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : served from a cask ( room-temperature ) in the porterhouse pub in dublin , ireland . pours a terrible head that is thin and lacks any cream at all . served at room temperature . colour is cloudy , dark gould . i 'm already questioning the brewer , though i 'm not used to cask beers ( this is my first ) , so i 'll withhold judgement . sm : a scent of moderate strength that suggests heavy pine and a little orange . maybe a little honey in there too . appealing and bold - i like it .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a nice amber color with very thin head . no lacing . carbonation seems high .	0000000000000000000
1	a : pours with an ivory white head , 2 fingers high . the head starts out fizzy and foamy and looks like it will disappear quickly , but multiple streamers keep it around for quite some time , eventually transforming the head into a dense , compact foamy cap . the body is hazy , but clear enough too see an endless amount of bubbles rushing by in a somewhat roundabout way . the color is between gold and goldenrod and has medium saturation . the entire glass is left coated with one continuous sheet of lace .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : clear medium to dark reddish brown color , the scant head disappeared immediately , the belgian cap and lace are minimal .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : two fingers of foamy off-white head is produced on the pour and then falls quickly . the body is a medium light brown-orange mix , very clear and similar in appearance to whiskey . except of course for the abundance of fast rushing bubbles . lacing from the head is minimal , and without a long lasting head or any type of surface film , the beer comes clean off of the glass as i continue to sip . not impressive .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : the beer poured a black with a ruby opaqueness to light . the beer has a very pleasing reverse cascading of the head during the pour . the head was nearly an inch and a half creamed coffee coloration . the lacing on the glass was practically like pancake batter .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a very light golden color with a few wisps of yeast sediment . the head amounts to 1/2 '' , is white in color , and shows a tad bit of retention .	000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : the best part of this beer . deep black with a tan , one finger creamy tan head .	000000000000000000000
1	a : simply perfect . slightly hazy , radiant orange body has a steady stream of bubbles rising form the tulip 's nucleation site to reinforce the tan , fine , 1.5 '' head . the head recedes slowly and from the sides , leaving a chunky mound of foam in the middle and multiple rings of lace on the sides . this just might be the best-looking ipa i 've ever seen . amazing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : did i buy a red wine by accident ? nope . i checked the label again , and it said `` blueberry lager . '' huh . the color is a deep , clear , purple-tinted amber . the head is straight-up purple , with soda fizziness . it disappears quickly .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : slightly hazy straw yellow to light gold color . 1/4 '' white head upon pouring quickly died back and left the barest of ring on the top and this was pretty much gone by the time i hit the last 1/3 of the glass . no lacing at all . plenty of bubbles coming up through the beer which was nice to look at , but the lack of lacing was a bummer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : the beer pours a orange hued golden color , maybe more amber , but the head is very small , thin white ring , and about no lacing ...	0000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : nice clarity , this one is a perfectly transparent ruby/amber that glows with a bright cherry redness in the waning sunlight . decent carbonation rising to about 1.5-fingers of frothy , crackling head . this sandy tan crowns drops over a couple minutes to a creamy , rather dense film , leaves excellent wide bands of lace .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pale gold with abundant carbonation and very slight haze . massive foamy white head - far more than could be intentional or appropriate . even after letting it settle down my glass is 2/3 clumpy white lace .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pale yellow , a little cloudy - could be mistaken for an over-carbonated american wheat . tiny creamy eggshell white head . spotty , uneven lacing . looks entirely unremarkable .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : great deep orange color but a lousy head that was gone by the end of the first sip	00000000000000000000
1	a : as this is poured , a wonderful cascading effect appears and leaves a two finger head on top of the dark brown/black body . hardly any lace though .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours black with nearly 3 fingers of tight mocha brown head that just does n't want to go anywhere . leaves great thick rings of lacing . picture prefect .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : hazy straw with a huge head at first . it eventually settles leaving no lacing behind .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a thick , muddy brown , sort of like , well , engine oil , unsurprisingly enough , with a slowly evolving and quickly fading chocolately cocoa head . the beer looks pretty intense , thick , syrupy almost , which made me pour more vigorously than i otherwise would ... but to no avail . there 's only a hint of surface lacing in the middle of the cervoise , light and dusty , and the head retention ( or lack thereof ) suggests what i later confirm regarding the legs , which are very erratic , blotchy , speckly almost , with no consistent patterns or stick-age occurring . not terrible , but not great .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : solid black , thin head , decent carbonation ; no lacing	0000000000000
0	appearance : pours about a finger and a half of a straw color . not hazy at all for a supposed `` wheat '' beer , and a bit below average for a sam adams appearance .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark brown , nice tan head , dissapates quicker than it should have .	0000000000000000
0	a : clear straw body with a thin white head . ok retention and lacing . pretty darn average .	00000000000000000000
1	appearance : i must say this beer was gorgeous sitting in a tulip glass . the beers body had a firey red coloration . the head was thin and very creamy . thick streams of lacing remained on the side of my glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : golden hue . the first half of this beer poured very clear with almost perfect transperancy , while the second half poured with lots of clouding . this beer was shipped in very cold weather and i hope it did n't ruin the beer . the head is nearly non-existent on an aggressive pour and this is very disappointing to me . i can agitate a very small amount of inconsistent sized bubbles which quickly disappear . i 'm getting carbonation bubbles throughout the session so the beer is not flat . the head just leaves something to be desired .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a rough pour yielded a huge dense coco colored head that slowly reduced into a firm mound of thick film over the nearly black liquid . the lace left was plentiful and creamy .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : great brownish black opaque body with a slight head that doesnt really stick .	0000000000000000
0	a : overly pale , almost colourless . very clear and the colour of white whine . no head , but there are some small white bubbles on the surface and some trickling up from the bottom .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the pour produces 3 fingers of light khaki brown head , frothy , bubbly and very long lasting . the body is a dark chestnut brown and completely opaque . extremely solid appearance .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a very dark brown with absolutely no head	00000000000
1	a : pours a slightly hazy orange color with a 1.5 finger white foamy head . by the time i got from the kitchen to my desk the head had reduced to a decent layer of foam on top . left some impressive lacing actually .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours yellow with a mild white head , good retention , no real lace .	00000000000000000
0	a : bright golden color , foamy head is small and white , nothing to highlight ;	00000000000000000
0	appearance : dark mahogany , thin fleeting tan head , not much lacing .	00000000000000
0	a : gentle pour yields a 1 finger coarse white head with poor retention . beer is a clear orange-amber . lacing is spotty and with little cling .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear yellow with , a medium fizzy white head , with poor retention . does n't really look like a wheat beer . i certainly expected something a little darker in colour due to the acai berries .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured a hazy yellow/orange with a lush , magnificent head . retention was excellent . this was a feast for the eyes	000000000000000000000000
1	a : amazing cascading pour . amber/copper-gold ; creamy white head . plenty of retention & lace . exceptional .	00000000000000000000
0	a : clear amber , golden hue . short , foamy off-white head . moderate retention , nice lacing .	00000000000000000000
1	a : really a lovely pint : crystal-clear complexion , few sleepy bubbles wriggling upward . plentiful head , a shade under a finger 's worth of ivory cream . beautiful lace in wide stripes , as if daubed on with a sponge .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a cloudy goldish orange hue with a rather wimpy head . no retention or lace noted .	00000000000000000000
1	a : pours a semi-vigorous 2.5 finger creamy , fluffy , fine white head with great retention . brew itself is a crystal clear golden bronze , showcasing ample carbonation . lacing is unbelievable , like a ruler on the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured a clear golden color with a sudsy head that quickly frittered away . little lacing .	0000000000000000000
1	a : clear reddish-amber color with active carbonation with minimal white head and lacing .	000000000000000
1	a : the looks of this beer are just awesome . this really deserves a 6 out of 5 , if only it were possible . pours an opaque black color with hints of ruby that sneak through the glass when held to the light . khaki colored , thick ceamy head sticks around for awhile .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : light yellow , to basically clear , even more clear than others	00000000000000
0	appearance : pours a very light , straw color . has a big white initially that slowly disappears into nothingness .	000000000000000000000
0	a : this stuff pours straw yellow and has a uniform haze about it . almost no head forms and what little bit of a ghostly white foam which did form dissipates rather quickly .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : i love the way this stuff looks . dense ultra creamy head that just leaves chunks of foam all over the glass . appears black , but under light you can see that it is actually much lighter , a shade of dark ruby .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : very dark brown , almost pitch black . espresso tan head that hangs to the edges .	0000000000000000000

0	a : pours a cloudy amber with bits of stuff in it . spotty lacing	000000000000000
0	a : this was the appropriate cloudy golden wheat color . it was served to me with a few big bubbles for a head .	0000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : extremely pale , yet very cloudy so that you ca n't see through it . i love that .	000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dark cola color with a small tan head that fades to a small ring and leaves little to no lacing . this is the only bad thing about this beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very clear with a golden color . the head is white , low and it seldom persists .	00000000000000000000
0	a : 1.5 finger head of lovely cream , tan colour , nice thickness , and good retention , especially in a snifter . ruby-black colour . appealing . sm : exceptionally strong scent of strawberry . feck 's sake that 's so powerful i could smell it before i poured it . ester ester ester . it 's overpowering .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : disappointed with the lack of head at all . this could have certainly been fault of the establishment . the color was a deep amber/red color that was very pleasant .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a thick , dense , creamy beige head . there 's a nice cascade effect as the beer settles to the bottom . the beer itself is opaque black .	000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : `` it smells . the aroma says stay away . '' j : `` hmmm ... smells like fish sauce . ''	000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a ... what the hell ? ! ? ! this is some kind of black magic ... this literally poured an entire glass of head without any beer . i have never seen such a thing before . bizarro . takes about 10 minutes to settle ... ridiculous overcarbonation . once the beer does appear it is a dark amber .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pink ? my suggestion , buy a can on march 31st and serve it to somebody in a clear glass who like grapefruit juice the next day ...	000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : holy head . lemon meringue beer right here . not sure what was going on , but i poured two of these and they both just exploded with a massive head , i 'm talking 5 inches of head for 2 inches of beer . annoying .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : black -- quite black -- with a great medium tan head that has amazing , steady retention	0000000000000000000
1	a : dark as used motor oil . held to the light , just the thinnest edge shows dark red . there were loads of carbonation when i poured it from the growler . it filled about half the glass . the head lasted for a very long time- thin but full across the top .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : golden straw color with a finger white head . not all that good of head retention , and not that good of lacing	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : first off i noticed the giant yeast cake on the bottom of the bottle . i poured carefully , hoping it would n't come loose and get into the glass , but it came loose immediately and voil : i had a glass of expensive beer with yeast globs swirling around in it . i waited for it to settle , as much as possible that is , and reviewed the appearance before i tasted it . it 's a thick , dark-red-brown to tar colored liquid with a slightly beige head . the head is quite thick and creamy and makes it look pretty good . nice head retention and nice co2 level .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : nice dark roast with a creamy beige head coming to the typical milk stout ring	00000000000000000
0	a : the appearance looks like a very pale honey with thin light straw clarity .	0000000000000000
1	a : when poured right , a pint of guinness is a thing of beauty . just under an inch of a tight light tan creamy head . sheets of lacing coat the glass as a nice skim settles in .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : an golden amber body with a dense and creamy white head ; loads of lacing and good head retention .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a light gold , color of light honey . very small head that drops away almost instantaneously . definitely not what i would expect from a belgian , and especially when sugar is added by the grapes . lace retention is pretty promising .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : deep amber with a bright white head that wo n't quit -- it starts off at about a half an inch and slowly settles down to an eighth leaving beautiful lacing down the glass before a sip 's even been taken . nice bubbles rising evenly to the top . a rare treat , here 's a golden ale you should let settle for a couple of minutes . a golden beer cappuccino .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a hazy light amber color with a terrific head that lasts forever and leaves copious lacing ; unfortunately , this blonde bombshell disappoints once you get to know her	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a hazy orange/red body with a light rust colored head . the head had little lasting time . the abv could be the cluprite but i have seen other strong ales with better head retention . other than that the appearance was appealing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a hazy burnt sienna with a rocky head that creates a craggy pattern of foam that leaves glacial deposits of foam around the sides of the glass	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : orange-gold , and only a small white head that faded very fast . a little cloudy , but good active carbonation from the looks of it .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : utterly devoid of any head , it seemed like the bartender had filled this one to the brim . only a lone collection of three or four bubbles remained and they soon went south . amber body with a dark orange hue , it was hard to tell exactly due to the subdued lighting in the irvine establishment . zero conditioning , you could be forgiven , like me , for thinking that this looks just like a 2 year old lambic jugged straight from the cellar !	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a reddish copper beer with a very small off white head that burns out quickly . very still . s/t : i found it to be a bit like a spicy alt beer . moderately malty nose with a roasted hazelnut scent and a hint of mineral hops . the beer is over all slightly sweet , nutty , slightly roasted . the finish is dry not fruity . there is a palpable spiciness on the throat at completion .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : very hazy dark orange body with a good sized head and some very thick lacing . just from the appearance you can tell it will be full of flavor .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : not much , short lasting head , pretty much looks like light apple juice	0000000000000000

0	appearance : medium to dark brown , clear with an almost non-existent fizzy head	00000000000000

1	a : super thick black with absolutely no light shining through . a humongous 2 inch mocha head that fades slowly . this is an old ale ? looks like a stout . very good .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : dense head , hazy light orange .	000000000
0	appearance : clear and golden with thin , fizzy white head . `` not impressed '' is what the rating is telling me ; i agree . could easily mistake this for a german pilsner .	000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : poured with very thing white head which quickly fizzled away . medium amber and crystal clear . more carbonation would have improved my opinion of this beer .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this beer pours a crystal clear amber color with a one finger of khaki colored head . head recedes somewhat quickly leaving minimal spotty lacing on the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a crystal clear golden body . an initial two-finger foamy white head of average retention leaves some nice holy sheets of spotty lacing , thick .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : 1 '' offwhite head that left a nice lacing over copper coloured liquid .	0000000000000000
1	appearance : pours smooth , decent amount of head but more thin and airy than most dark beers . the beer itself was deep brown-black like a porter . impressive . the sort of beer that makes bud light defenders wince just looking at it .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours an apricot color with about a finger of bright white bubbly head that quickly fizzed away into a thin collar . as the beer sat even the collar disappeared until the liquid simply looked like flat juice in my glass . no lace .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a light golden color with a fluffy off white head that looks like a glazed donut . not as cloudy as i would have imagined or the style calls for , but still good looking .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : thick , creamy head with a body the color of dark raspberries . the body is slightly clear and the color is reflected in the head . very nice looking .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a dark amber with hints of red . a slightly hazy , but overall clear beer . the head is creamy and offwhite . it does n't get very big , but it is that sort of short seductive creamy head i enjoy . perfect never ending retention .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : an aggressive pour yields a decent tan head that bubbles away quickly leaving only a minimal ring around the exterior , reminds me of the head on a glass of pop . color is black as night and unyielding to any light that might enter .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : light amber to gold , cloudy unfiltered look . pours a 1 finger head of foam and quickly dissipates with no lacing what-so-ever .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : served in a tulip snifter with a about a 1/4 '' of very thin , very big bubbled , but also very resilient light tan head ( it was as if some one had put a straw into the glass and blew the bubbles that became the head on this beer ) . opaque black in color . visibly thin .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : the ale is a very pale yellow color . it poured with a decent head and is clear , no visible particles or sediment . appearance definitely strikes me as too light .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours hazy golden orange with a 2 inch white head . excellent retention and nice arrangement of small and large bubbles with many craters lining the surface . plenty of lace lines the sides of the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : served in pint glass with clear and substantial carbonation . head was small for a pilsner but the lacing was tight .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : bright gold with a pretty substantial white head . retention is reasonable as is the lacing . loads of visible carbonation through a very clear body . certainly not bad to look at !	000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : poured into the duvel glass that i got in a four pack of duvel . came for the glass , stayed for the beer . pours a hazy straw colored gold , with an absolutely huge , booming head of billowy white dreams . one of the best beers i 've seen , leaving behind good lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark brown with ruby highlights around the edges . a perfect two finger tan head forms that sticks throughout . sticky , spiderweb lace is left in sheets . i do n't think a beer could look any better .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : this is possibly the most gorgeous beer i have ever seen . poured into a water goblet and held up into the light of the early morning sun , this maredsous 10 is a radiant orange . the soft , cloud like white head is supported by a lively stream of carbonation . lacing coats the glass on all sides , top to bottom .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : pours out a clear , humble-looking , brown body with a woefully thin , short-lived head . a rather dull look , i must say .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a reddish amber color . hazy with a thin soapy head .	00000000000000

0	appearance : pours a hazy golden yellow with minimal white head .	000000000000
0	appearance : southern tier recommends that i pour `` pumking '' into a goblet . so i poured this pumpkin ale into a chimay chalise/goblet . it was close enough . this pumpkin ale poured a clear orange color that was just a shade under being a true pumpkin orange . on top of this clear orange beer was a thin less than 1/4 of an inch head of white foam . it was a sad looking head of foam by any standard . this small head of foam quickly fizzled away into about 5 small white rings . it did n't even bother to leave behind any kind of lace behind . how could it ? it was too damn small . it had nice color to it , but the head of foam was lacking big time !	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : looks very cloudy and with absolutely no head . well , almost no head , i managed some white bubbles by pouring very vigorously . it 's a rich , cloudy golden color with no real active carbonation to speak of , maybe a little but those probably resulted from the pouring .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : as far as ipas go this one is a little darker than most ; however , this is one gorgeous looking beer . deep copper/ amber color with a tan head that slowly fades and leaves patches on the top of the beer and clings to the side of the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : bright red color . very odd , but it is to be expected from a beer whose main ingredients are beets . not really a fan of beers that more so resemble juice then beer , but i enjoy trying things .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear golden hue with thin patches of bubbles here and there . the head dies down after initial pour .	0000000000000000000000

1	appearance : gold in color , very clear , and has very good head retention .	0000000000000000

0	a : pours a jet black color with just the faintest amount of brown around the edges . a small beige cap forms , but recedes to nothing in a second . no lace to speack of .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark brown - just shy of a stout .	00000000000
1	appearance : a burnt orange body which said color is lightly reflected in the head . very good lacing with a strong 4 finger head that settles to 2 . body is rather clear . nice looking .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a slightly hazy light golden color with a massive foamy head that takes up half the pint glass . columns of active carbonation stream from the bottom of the glass . yep , it 's a belgian . great sustain with thick lacing all over the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours rather light and almost clear , even after agitating the yeast at the bottom of the bottle and pouring it into the glass . a fairly vigourous pour yeilds only a half inch cap , i was expecting more from this to say the least .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : black , creamy tan head .	00000000

0	appearance : well , it 's deep brown/black like a porter should be , but it does n't quite pull off many other traits i 'd expect from a porter . the head is lager like , not creamy and it makes pop like fizzle as you set it down . i managed to get a finger 's worth but it was gone in a nearly a minute .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : very light pilsner look . no head and barely any carbonation rising to the top .	000000000000000000
1	a : nice and elegant looking dark brown/almost black color . three finger foamy late colored head ... i think i was a bit aggressive on the pour which is why the head was so big . in the end , it ended up giving the beer an awesome appearance ; the good retention also helped in the cause . excellent lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : no head whatsoever . pale , but slightly golden	00000000000
0	appearance : light , hazy lemon color seems to describe it best . no matter how aggressively i pour this , or no matter what glass , i ca n't get any kind of head whatsoever . just a few bubbles that disappear instantly . similarly , just a bit of very thin lacing . good carbonation . odd based on my expectations .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : this beer poured a slightly hazy , amber color with an off-white head . the fizzy bubbles rose up easily to two fingers and then faded away quickly . a thin , wavery patch of foam was all that remained after just a minute or two . there was no lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : it has a nice dark brown color to it with some ruby/amber hues coming through . it has a nice tan head that dies down moderately and leaves very little lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : gorgeous . like amber . literally , like the fossilized tree resin . dark but super clear . i did manage a thin foamy head on the pour , but by the time i got my laptop out , it was only a memory . it looks like someone took a great scotch whiskey and a nice bordeaux red wine and ( gasp ) mixed them together . as the wine snobs say , this has legs . thick , clear liquid clings to the glass after giving it a swirl . and it stays . and stays . i could stare at this drink for an hour .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : hazy light copper with a fine , foamy head .	000000000000
1	appearance : this beer pours a black color . it looks like a less viscous version of motor oil . no carbonation , no lacing , no nothing . this , of course , is to be expected .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : clear glass bottle with silver label , line drawing of the eponymous birdon it . silver foil around neck . when poured properly , minimal head and lacing appear , and remain . not so bad .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : sediment laden ruby to brown pour with very little carbonation . extremely thin head , probably even more because it was in a duvel glass and did n't measure to what i was used to seeing in there . barely any lacing to describe .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : bright gold with a very large bubbly white head . very clear with large carbonation bubbles easily seen .	000000000000000000000

0	a : yellow and fizzy . thin white head appears rather fizzy and fleeting . it looks like standard malt liquor - i hope i have n't been swindled ...	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a weakish mahogany brown with a sudsy thin layer of head ( where 's the beef ? ) , pretty clear for an unfiltered weizen , some lace	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours almost oily black , with a slight bit of carbonation . the head comes out to b 2-3 cm in height and with a brown tint .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark , amber/crimson hue with a huge marshmallow-like head . head quickly dissipates leaving ample lacing . sort of reminds me of unibroue 's maudite . nice .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear bright yellow with a very thin head . looks overcarbonated . three finger head is pathetic and retains poorly . this may be the worst head i 've ever seen . sm : a bland stale note of barley .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : brilliant , clear copper body with over 2 '' of creamy , rocky off-white head . great retention and tons of lace . stellar .	000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : incredible . pours a deep reddish-brown with a huge tan fluffy head . the micro-bubbles dissipate very slowly and form a sticky lacing in large patches all the way down the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a medium amber color with lots of carbonation . strangely , the cabonation seems settled at the bottom of the glass and is not rising as much as is typical . the head poured quite large , almost two fingers , and is a silky ivory with lots of bubbles .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : hazy . sort of a macro look to it as it has the same kind of piss yellow color to it . head builds up but disappears in a flash . not much retention to speak of . hey , as long as it tastes good .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : very pale but descent head that disappears fast	0000000000

1	appearance : pours a vibrant golden orange with some chill haze . head is very small and fades very quickly .	000000000000000000000
0	a : fuzzy orangey , yellow beer . a faint ring of white-ish colored head that left no lacing .	00000000000000000000
1	a : this was a very hazy dark brown tinted with orange and dark ruby . not at all what i expected . it pours with a large white froth that quickly fades to a thin covering . as i swirled for the aromatics though , the head reformed every time .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : gorgeous brew . cloudy yellow with a 2 finger head that looks like mousse . intense lacing leaving it 's mark with each sip . absolutely beautiful .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured thick and black with light lacing . the dark brown head was very thin and quickly dissipated ; very similar to bourbon county stout .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours with a finger of head that did not retain at all , or lace . the body does n't show much in the way of carbonation , but it is unsurprisingly dark with a very deep red when put to the light .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a beautiful hazy golden color with a thick white foamy head of at least an inch . retention is superb with great lacing down the glass . i ca n't imagine a better look for a hefe !	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : giant fluffy white head on a clear pale yellow body showing strong carbonation . clumpy lace on the glass as the head started a slow retreat . flavor : grain flavors predominate , slightly sweet but well balanced with a slightly peppery hop .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a one finger ivory white head that had no retention . the color of the beer is a medium amber color with reddish hues . the the clarity of the beer is clear . there is some effervescence in the beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the head retention and lacing were better than i have seen on most anything nice copper blond color .	000000000000000000000
1	a : i give this a perfect score just for the hilarious art work and funny name . the beer was golden in color and highly carbed which lead to a big bubbly head .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours dark yellow to copper color with paper thin head that diminishes within seconds . it looks like another generic , macro-skewed beer for those who wish to drink something different from the bar other than bud light , budweiser , and coors .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a dark brown color with some lighter brown highlights . the light tan head is short-lived and only grew to 1/4 '' . no lacing remains .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dark mahogany color , little in the way of a head and what forms does n't keep .	00000000000000000000
0	a : this beer had too much carbonation out of the get go . i got a huge glass of foam and the carbonation continued to push foam out of the bottle . it was relentless . the body is a totally opaque , pitch black brew . the head is beyond frothy , a healthy sandy caramel color . not bad looking beer once you get past the carbonation problems	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : clear , dirty light amber color that poured with a nice head that quickly dissipated	00000000000000000
1	appearance : 5 |	0000
1	appearance : great looking beer , a hazy golden orange . two finger head settled down to about a half finger of thick , fluffy , creamy white head that left tidemarks and impressive lace . flavor : there is enough malt to bring all the hops back to somewhere in the area of balance , but as the beer warmed , the hops really picked up and came close to a hop burn . a touch of sweet malt poked though to give a nice overall taste . the hops seem to be noble , hallertauer perhaps .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : light hay yellow . no head .	000000000
0	a : slightly hazy dark amber color . aggressive pour yielded only a couple milimeters of head that quickly fell and left no lacing . small floaties throughout with some sediment at the bottom . this is one ugly ass brew . 4.0	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pale yellow with no real head . it poured about half a finger and disappeared in under 5 seconds . the beer is very hazy and only renders the appearance of shadows through the glass . there is almost no carbonation visible moving in the glass after a few minutes .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear dark copper with a big bubbly head with lots of sustain and thick lace .	00000000000000000000
1	a : this is a very , very light straw yellow with a pure white head . the head lingered deep into the experience and reminded me of whipped cream .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : wildly impressive . enormous head right out of the gate and still rising . i turned my head for 30 seconds , looked back , and it had overcome the rim of the glass and was n't stopping . i could n't help being reminded of a slowly erupting volcano . the head was nothing short of billowing and lasted very long . ( no concerns there as you definitely want to let the temperature get to 50-55 degrees f. )	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours to a rust-red with a small , fizzy white head that disappears quickly .	00000000000000000
0	appearance : a very weak white two finger head that has very little retention . i poured the beer hard and still resulted in a weak head . the color of the beer is a medium amber color . the clarity of the beer is hazy and dense .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : the appearance of this beer was not very impressive . there was no head whatsoever . i think this mostly has to do with an improper pour . the color was a brownish/red and was very clear .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : copper body under a good sized white head . good lace and excellent retention . great looking beer .	000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a golden/amber with a 2 finger head that dissapates very quickly .	000000000000000
1	a : pours clear golden with a large white thick head that quickly sinks into spiderweb-like lacings .	000000000000000000
1	a : pours a magnificent deep dark brown liquid with one of the most beautiful tan heads i 've seen ! looks delicious .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : light & golden with minimal ( fizzy ) head . lots of carbonation flows upward to the surface . zero lacing .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a thick , murky black out of the cask , with a thick off-white/tan head , i can see what the nitro-can guys are going for now .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a slightly hazy golden color with some orange highlights . quite active visible carbonation . the head has an off-white cream color and is tall , frothy , and reasonably dense . retention is nice . some creamy lace is left along the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : copper , very little tanned foam , lots of i do n't know what floating inside , making it murky	0000000000000000000000
0	a : highly unimpressed . clear , but dull gold . very few bubbles . no head what-so-ever . obviously , no lace .	000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a hazy orange color with a fluffy 3 '' + head that lasts a long time . nice lace paints the glass .	00000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : drop dead gorgeous clear orange copper color with a quarter finger off-white/tan head dropping to a thin cover that left trace lacing . flavor : the metallic smell is amplified in the taste . it really has that copper penny sensation . im working hard to get past that taste , and i am getting underlying goodness : lightly roasted malt , bready yeast , mild apple and grape tastes , but it is really work to get there . the metallic flavor faded a bit as it warmed , but faded to the aftertaste .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark auburn color , the pour produces one finger of tannish color head that leaves nice rings of lace .	0000000000000000000000
0	appearance : hazed dusty golden colour with a fluffy white head that slowly subsides to a thin bubbly lace . haze goes away a little after the beer warms up a bit .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : opaque black , with a thick head .	0000000000
1	a : pours a hazy orange / apricot color with yellow tint when held to the light . a 1 '' thick head recedes into a light film and collar around the drink , proceeding to deposit thick gushes of lace down the glass as i drink .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : black body with bright orange-brown highlights . no head to speak of . not that great , really , but i wo n't say it 's below average for a 5 year old ba stout .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : jet-black , with the slightest bit of light peeking through at the edge . nice tan head . flavor : the taste lacks that rancid note i caught in the nose , so i & # 8217 ; m thinking i didn & # 8217 ; t get a contaminated bottle , that & # 8217 ; s just the way it smells . a bit sweet for a porter , the deep roasted malt taste comes through , but i & # 8217 ; m also getting an adjunct like taste , corn , or some other sugar ? i don & # 8217 ; t know .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured into a pint fairly vigorously . decent head of a couple fingers that 's still at half a finger a few minutes later . gorgeous copper amber color . digging the look on this beer . strange for a regular bitter , but pretty nonetheless .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear bronze-orange body with a thin white head that rapidly vanishes ( eggenberg beers do n't seem to have much head retention ) .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark mahogany with amber edges , half finder caramel head dissipates instantly .	000000000000000

1	a : super thick head with a light tan color , that fades a bit but stays with the beer the whole way down . doesnt leave much lacing . small but vigorous bubbles rising from the bottom . the beer is a sweet/black ice tea color .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poor head , no lacing , little carbonation , and clear yellow color . in all , this beer looks like watery apple juice .	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : i rarely give a 5 for appearance , but this deserves it . its dark like it should be , and its got a huge mocha colored head , and the lacing is just awesome ...	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : 1/2-3/4 '' ivory-to-tan head has some staying power . beer is a beautiful dark copper / light brown and crystal clear . perfect for a brown ale .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pretty casual brown with a below average head . frustratingly the head dissappeared shortly after the beer was served .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : pours pitch black with a lot of dark tan , almost chocolate colored head . head reduced to a thick film on top .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : not terribly pretty to look at ... cloudy golden with almost no head . a very faint lingering film witha few stray carbonation bubbles . sort of resembles dirty dishwater .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a half finger head of slight cream , fair thickness , and abysmal retention . colour is a semitransparent copper . sm : vinegar , nuts , and light hops . the darker hops are amber-esque , strange for an alleged biere de garde . light yeast is present as well . a mild strength aroma .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours black with a huge , dense , dark ruddy-brown head that slowly faded into a thick film that left some soapy streaks of lacing down the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a cloudy golden-amber-copper color ; as a result of one of the most aggressive pours of my life , results in a two finger frothy white head with good lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : brownish-amber , off-white head , no retention or lace .	000000000000
0	appearance : thin sheet of tan lace , very dark brown colour & # 8230 ; almost black .	0000000000000000000
1	a : looks quite like hopdevil : a translucent amber with soft white head that forms pillowy clumps as it recedes . leaves quite beautiful lacing down the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark black with a thick beige head , the head recedes slowly and leaves lots of lacing	0000000000000000000

1	appearance : guinness draught is truly a beautiful thing . perhaps the prettiest glass of beer i have ever seen , a tulip-shaped pint glass filled with a properly pulled guinness draught is as iconic as it gets . it 's dark reddish-brown ( not quite black ) , pierced by laser beams of red light , and capped by a creamy tan head . and my god , the bubbles-i could get lost watching the head settle on a pint , it 's simply hypnotic .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dirty/murky chestnut/auburn pour with a weird head that mimics a fizzy soda topping : a single layer of fat , ivory-colored bubbles clumped at the rim in a skewed ring . no visible carbonation , no lace .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured from a 22 oz bomber into two pint glasses , it was all foam . it took awhile for it to settle into a bronzed off-white fluffy , pillowy head over a cloudy coppery-amber body . lots of sediment in suspension . that foam leaves sticky clumps in spider web patterns on the side of the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : gentle pour yields a frothy , full , slightly off-white 2 finger head with oustanding retention . beer is a clear amber/orange . lacing is unbelievable . ringed with great stick .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours completely black with a small , frothy off white head that lingers a bit .	000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured from a 500ml bottle . not much of a head . had a nice light brown , caramel color . crystal clear	0000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured pitch black into a pint glass . thick head retention that lasted a good while . smell - full of hops . like grabbing a handful of hop pellets and putting them to your nose .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : slightly hazy , medium golden color with a white foam head of big , rocky bubbles that vanish in seconds , revealing the still liquid surface of the beer . no lacing remains on the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear amber with short-lived off-white head . like the other kuhnhenn bottles we opened that day , this is nearly still .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a slightly hazy orange with two fingers of white head that recedes into a thin cap with good lacing . definitely one of the better looking pumpkin ales i 've had .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : slightly hazy straw yellow color with puny white foam head that quickly reduced to a thin rim and no lace	0000000000000000000000

0	a : auburn and clear with a moderate head and lacing that just holds on enough throughout the beer .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : the beer pours like water ; a cupple bubbles for a couple seconds , and then there 's nothing left . this beer left no trace of a head .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear lemon-golden color with a finger width of dense white head that floated on top of the beer like a dollop of whipped cream , motionless until i took the first sip . actually , the etching on the bottom of the glass created enough carbonation , that in the time it took me to write this section and the smell section of my review , the head grew to almost double its size and became the consistency of thick whipping cream . you could eat it with a spoon . a thick layer stayed the whole beer through and left sticky patches of lacing on the way down .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : seriously , the greatest bulbous head i 've ever seen on a porter to date ; caramel-coloured froth , thin-nitting of blackened desire , spectacular embolization . it was a clinquant moment for all , as i gleefully sipped at for a while 's time ; it might 've been just for how good it looked/looks ... .but one can never really tell . but bigness is n't everything .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : a dark brown pour comes out flat and leaves a bit of a bubbly head . black body and no carbonation ; looks quite still . a few bubbles stick around for a while , but ends up looking flat and is generally unappealing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : beautiful dark red , that leaves a lace	0000000000
0	a : pours a murky dull orange color with pretty much no head ... there are carbonation bubbles visible on the side of the glass . whatever the case , the few big bubbles of off-white head do leave some patches of spotty lacing on my glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : golden orange colored , hazy with some floaties . two fingers of off-white head..tons of texture . loads of caked on lacing around the entire glass . thick , foamy film with a good bit of larger bubbles .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : opaque orange-yellow with honey highlights and a tall creamy white head . hills and valleys of lacing cling to the sides of the glass .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pretty nice golden color that is spot on for the style . almost no sound when i popped the cap , and it shows on the pour - almost no head , leaving just a ring in a matter of minutes .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : deep ruby pour with brown edges . a thick sudsy tan cap forms on top . minimal effervescence noted . flavor : more raisins , oatmeal , bready notes that have a wonderful balance . fruity esters and bready malt notes are so well knit together . low spice notes remind me of cinnamon and nutmeg . finish is clean and dry .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a nice , clear golden-amber , a little on the light side - it 's much darker in the growler . two fingers of white head that just sits there - dissipates very slowly , and left massive amounts of lacing . beautiful looking beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : well , the friggin beer was so overcarbonated it shot out of the bottle and got every where . i salvaged about half of it . dammit . ok . pours a *very* carbonated beer with a monsterous snowy white head . body is sort of a cloudy , apricot juice colored beer with a little bit of activity going on inside .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : black with almost no head formation at all even with an aggressive pour . no lacing .	0000000000000000000
1	appearance : the body is an opaque dark brown color . the head is four or five fingers tall , light tan in color , huge sized bubbles , wonderful retention and thick sticky lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : nice golden color , rather small head that dissipated quickly .	0000000000000
0	appearance : clear ruby colored . thought it might be darker . big head that i expect from a belgian dark , but it doesnt stick around . really not much lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a thin white head dissipates into nothingness , light carbonation present . body is a light yellow that is ultra clear .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark copper color with reddish tones , the foamy head has a finger in thickness without consistency ;	00000000000000000000
1	a : nice ruby red/brown color with a 3 finger billowy off-white head that sticks around extremely well .	0000000000000000000
0	a : pours with very little head , but a whole ton of floating yeast or protein globs , for lack of a better term . a golden straw-like color , the beer is about as murky and cloudy as i 've ever seen . virtually no lacing . not very appealing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very pale and yellow like straw , with a thin white lace that barley holds on .	0000000000000000000
1	appearance : the glassware really makes kwak impressive to behold . my friend was skeptical that bxl east would serve it in the proper glassware . it 's a good thing they did because it 's shimmering amber body and creamy crown have never looked better . in this case , presentation makes a huge difference .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark brown with a finger of beige head . the head leaves a pretty nice layer , though no lacing to speak of .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark brown with a fairly large , tan head	00000000000
0	a : pours a one finger head with nice cream lacing . decent thickness . hazy orange colour . poor retention is understandable considering the 8 % abv . sm : fruit esters : orange and citrus mainly . hoppy but light strength .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : jet black , nearly opaque brew with dense head of foam . about as stout as stout gets , i should think	000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : the body was black as night with an abundance of small dark tan bubbles that fills the top half of the glass before slowly settling at the top of the glass . the head that forms is thick and creamy with a light tan color .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a medium amber color with copper hues . there was a quarter inch ivory head that is foamy . there is some effervescence in the beer . the clarity of the beer is clear and slightly hazy .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : golden-bronze with plenty of particulate floating about ; pours with an off-white head ; absolutely no retention or lace .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : i poured this belgian `` bock '' beer into my tall urthel tulip glass . it should be the correct glassware because it was pictured on the back label . this belgian beer poured a dark and murky reddish orange color . i guess i could also say that it was a dark beer , but the cranberry red was on the pale side and was mixed in with a small tint of orange . it was a very interesting color ! on top of this beer was a tall pillowy and creamy 2 inch off white colored head of foam . it was so creamy that it looked like there was a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top of my beer . this head had terrific slow retention that left behind a 3/4 of an inch off white colored film and a wealth of sticky streaks of lace around the glass . a top notch appearance indeed ! the color of the beer was just as nice as the wonderful head of foam .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this immediately reminded me of a belgium tripel . hazy golden color , lots of streamers fill the goblet and rise to the underside of a frothy , pillow like bleach white head . immense carbonation lends excellent conditioning to the beer & a swirl soon induces a chaotic mass of small bubbles , that soon settle down into an ordered whish that continue to support the velvety smooth head . very good appearance !	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very orangey amber with a slight haze . pretty nice head at first , but not great retention , and the lacing is spotty . sort of in between an ipa and a wheat beer in appearance , but not a great looking one of either .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : the beer is a very pale yellow color with a thin white head that fades almost instantly and leaves very little lace on the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a very dark brown with a light brown/tan head . beautiful as it settles , the movement underneath the half-finger head is trippy as hell , like brown cascading clouds , of course due to the nitro-can . decent lacing left as i drink .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : bright , crystal clear , fizzy , with white head . for style , it had a solid appearance . limited lacing and head retention . for anyone who loves good beer , and especially sitting in belgium , it 's appalling . nevertheless , i rated it for style .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a brilliant , hazy gold . cloudy , but full of life . one of the creamiest 2-finger eggshell heads i 've ever seen , with excellent retention . perfect 5 on this one .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the beer pours a rich dark color with a huge foamy caramel/parchment colored head .	00000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a super clear very active with bunches of bubbles rising to keep the head frothy for quite some time . even after a couple minutes it still has oodles of bubbles rising , and the head does n't look like it will be letting up any time soon .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pale washed-out light ( whitish ) yellow color . poured a 1 finger white head that dissipated to a skim around the edges . light lacing broke and washed down the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : watery yellow appearance with a big-bubble head , not an attractive beer .	000000000000000
1	a : pours a very deep brownish-crimson color with a sizeable off-white head that retains well and lays down a bit of lacing on my snifter . very impressive appearance .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : light yellow brew with a nice 1 '' of rocky white foam . good retention and huge lacing .	000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a beautiful , translucent , dark magenta . large foamy pink head exhibits excellent retention and leaves layers of lacing . i 'm hesitant to give this a 5 because i 'm not 100 % sure that this is really normal for the style .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : minimal 3cm head off the pour with moderate legs and lasting lacing . the color is an intense , candied ruby , similar to a darker rose & # 8242 ; , but in a good way . the orange peels seem to make an impact on the color as well , as it has a pumpkin tint .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a lifeless murky brown with zero head . there appears to be floaties ... pretty much looks like muddy water	00000000000000000000000
1	a : great looking beer with a one finger head and no lacing on the glass . orange with some floating yeast and hop residue . resembles a bavarian hefeweizen .	0000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : clear orange/gold color . poured a 1 finger fizzy white head that immediately dissipated to a ring of bubbles around the inside edge of the glass . decanted lightly . no lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : gentle pour yields a coarse , 1 finger powdery white head that dissipates quickly . beer is a semi-clear yellow with floaties in it . i 've heard of unfiltered but this makes me scared to dirnk it ... very stringy , almost non-existant lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : it has a clear and golden body with no head at all . very carbonated .	000000000000000000
0	a : a subtle film forms above this deep brown bodied brew and fades rather quickly . some lacing was detected .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : looks solid . caramel colored with some transluscence . nice lacing on the glass after the somewhat prodigioud head ( for a barleywine ) drops to a fine rim .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a huge fizzy 2.5 finger head that is full of large bubbles and pasty white colored , supplemented by many bubbles floating to the top . it 's a brilliantly clear golden yellow color . the head leaves a very slight lacing on the sides . n : a nice toasty slightly malty sweet lager aroma . very much so lager , and nice smelling too . some light wheat and even a touch of banana .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a half finger head of fair cream , decent thickness , and bad retention . colour is a semitransparent orange-gold . sm : hoppy and floral . a moderate strength aroma .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : amber-bronze , zero head .	0000000
1	appearance : a truly beautiful pour ... whether this is an authentic octoberfest beer or considered an amber / red ... deep , tawny , copper hue with a gigantic foamy and frothy head that exhibited enormous staying power before slowly receding ...	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : light yellow with a very thin white bubly head .	000000000000
1	appearance : orange-copper in pour , with a good size head . good amount of carbonation in the glass .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : heady , pale orange in color . sediment floats around after poured and finally settles to the bottom .	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : i sampled this in a chalice ( not a chimay chalice however ) , which effects the color a bit ... the beer was slightly cloudy and blood red , bordering on brown . head was about an inch thick on top , white and megenguey ( alright , do n't know how else to describe it , but it stayed above the top of the glass without spilling over like a merengue pie ) . lacing was ample	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a nearly opaque black color with a little bit of ruby/brown around the edges . a tightly packed tan head rises to over two fingers with good retention . light lace is left behind .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a slightly hazy golden with a big frothy head . good sustain and lacing .	000000000000000000
1	a : pours near black with a huge dark mocha head that slowly faded into a thick , dense , melted chocolate ice-cream layer of a film that left broken sheets of fine lacing down the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark brown/black like motor oil that has been partially used . ca n't see through it at all . thick , frothy , creamy head that retains well . 4.0	0000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : black as oil , of course , with the thinnest brown head left over after a minute . seemed like it was tinted with a touch of red ?	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the beer pours a lightly cloudy golden orange color with a dense white head .	00000000000000000
0	a : opaque dark amber , tan head .	000000000
1	appearance : the widget drove the beer crazy at first , and it started blowing out of the can . i caught up to it with my glass , so only a few drops were abused . the beer was initially all head that was cascading about the glass . a very nice looking beer . eventually the head started moving up the glass , and let the beer settle into three layers ( creamy head on top , and a foamy layer between the head and beer , and a clear reddish amber liquid underneath ) . eventually the middle transitional layer disappears and leaves just cream on top of beer . it looks like you could stand a penny on the head . i am almost afraid to drink it , as i do n't want to disturb it 's perfection . after i finally drank it , the beer left a seriously thick sheet of lace on the glass . nice !	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : crystal-clear copper body . pours a good two-finger , frothy head that leaves decent lacing . this presents rather well .	00000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very clear , with a light golden color . the head is white , large and frothy although not very persistent .	000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours a cloudy golden with a thick , white head that leaves sheets of lace .	000000000000000000
0	a : clear amber color , decent frothy head that holds alright . looks dull and uninteresting though , but maybe the label just has me too excited to be satisfied . : (	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a crystal clear dark urine yellow with hints of apple juice gold , and with a worse head than most sodas , which fizzles out too quick for me to get a good look at it ( before i had time to put down the can ) and settles into a single whitish splotch on top . a single stream of carbonation quickly and continually rises to the top . some lacing can be momentarily coaxed out when the glass is swirled , but once again reduces to near nothingness , save a microscopically thin ring around the edge .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours dark w/light head , looks thin , nothing great .	0000000000000
0	appearance : pours a light orange gold , fairly transparent and very little head that dissipates very rapidly . it also has a lot of carbonation ? looks like the beer in commercials where bubbles are constantly fizzing up .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : brown in color with a few bubbles floating on the beer surface .	000000000000000
1	appearance : .the beer looks nice , vivid , rich golden amber color , thick creamy white head , the head retains for a bit then dissipates after several minutes . nice lacing , hangs on the sides of the glass through out .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : yellow ; transparent ; thin white head that went away pretty quick	00000000000000

0	a : pours a cloudy bright orange with no head . small smattering of bubbles .	0000000000000000

0	a : pours jet-black with no head whatsoever , even with a vigorous pour . filmy mocha lacing sits atop this brew . as i said , this may be an off bottle , but i 'm not impressed with how this looks at all .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : brown opaque beer with a very very thin cream colored head with very low retention and low lacing .	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : black in color with a one inch creamy head , opaque -- even when poured from a nitro can , beers do not look much better than guinness	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : golden light orange with mild haze from bottle conditioning . massive bubbly white head pours then settles to a meringue firm foam atop the beer . the carbonation is fine bubbles but big and constant . flawless presentation . ( 5.0 )	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : moderate pour yields one finger of just off-white head with good retention . cloudy red-gold is gorgeous when held up to the sunset ! this beer is translucent , kind of has the light transmission of a wit .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : this beer has a blackish-brown body with red highlights . the head is a creamy texture , ivory in color , and about 1/2 finger . very little to no lacing , but it 's definitely mostly lasting . visible carbonation .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a very dark , but clear amber . sorry , not brown . a creamy , dense yet huge head erupts during pour and leaves very nice brussels lacing . does not appear to be very bubbly .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear golden , very thin head that fades fast . no lacing . tiny carbonation bubbles rise rapidly .	00000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours pale yellow with a slight fast dissipating head	00000000000
1	a : hazy golden blonde with a fantastic head ... retention is amazing and it leaves a lacing that has me trying to pick out shapes like in the clouds . i can swear i see continents in there .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours with very little head . clear light golden color	000000000000
0	appearance : severely lacking . pours brown . i expect jet black from a imperial stout . no head .	00000000000000000000
1	appearance : a clear , golden orange beer is quite active from the carbonation that streams to the surface of the brew . a 1/2 '' yellowish white head shows great retention and enough sticky lace to write home about .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours black , opaque . huge dark khaki head forms damn tight and stays up for a very long time . good lacing in the snifter .	00000000000000000000000000000

0	a : average redish to golden color . no head	0000000000
0	a : ok , first -- on opening the cap , i got a strong `` pfffft '' and looked quickly to see if it was overflowing . no , but then i poured it into a pint glass and it was all foam . strangest thing i 'd ever seen -- i do n't think i poured more than a half-inch worth of beer out of the bottle and literally 3/4 of the pint glass was foam . as i get to this point of typing the review , i 've now got 1-finger of beer and 2 fingers of foam -- light , airy foam that 's light-tan in color . ok , so i tried to pour some more in the glass and now i 've got 2-fingers of liquid and 4 fingers of foam . at this rate it should take me a half hour to pour the beer , though that foam does settle down somewhat quickly [ just noticed the bottle now has about 2-fingers ' worth of foam at the neck too ] . . . . alright , a half hour was an exaggeration , but it 's been 10 minutes and i still have about 1/3 of the bottle to go . with every small pour , i immediately get a geyser of foam that rises back to the top of the glass . my patience is wearing thin .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this beer looks undeniably beautiful when poured . orange-copper in the glass , with a copper-tinged off-white head ( started out darker and then seemed to lighten , do n't know if it was my eyes playing tricks on me or if the lightening of the head was actually taking place ) . two perfect fingers of head , great lacing , the whole deal . no one can deny that this beer looks lovely .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dark for an ipa . small head with minimal lacing . weakest part of this beer	000000000000000000
1	appearance : it seemed a little out of place , but i poured this weyerbacher into a chimay chalise . this farmhouse ale poured a orange copper with a creamy 1 1/2 inch head of white foam . this head of foam had excellent retention be leaving behind a creamy white film and a large amount of white streaks of lace around the glass . a great farmhouse ale appearance !	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : wow ... best head ever . so tall , so firm , so dense you could eat it with a fork . really quite a thing to behold . body is root beer brown , dark but not opaque , with bright , visible bubbles .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear light pale yellowish color . a minimal head and no lace .	00000000000000000
1	a : light copper . white tea that laces .	0000000000
1	a : the appearance is a nice straw color . the head is very thick , and sticks around a while .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : dark brown with a very rocky , long lasting head . the lacing is incredible .	000000000000000000
0	a : dark brown with a slight amber hue . floaties in the bottom . one finger of head disappeared too quickly , leaving no lacing at all . super sediment .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured a strange yellow color into my pint glass . no real head or lacing on this one .	000000000000000000000
1	a : orange cloudy , similiar to a hef but darker , lots of rising bubbles forming a huge white cloudy head . left a wall of lacing . impressive .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : lightest of amber with a popping foamy head . the lacing was nonexistent , but i blame the glass . other than that , this is a looker .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : this poured a cloudy light straw color with quickly dissipating white head .	000000000000000
0	a : pours a surprisingly cloudy pale chalky yellow color with a huge eggshell white head that slowly faded into a thick film that left tons of spotty lacing down the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : totally uncarbonated black liquid with a brown tinge at the edges . no head whatsoever .	000000000000000000
1	a : a rich and dark chocolatey-brown color , quite dense . pours with a thick bubbly cloud of light-brownish head that settles down fairly quickly and leaves a thin ring atop the beer the whole way down . thin and spotty lacing , but still this beer is just asking to be drank .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : golden color with a very good foam neck .	00000000000
0	a : clear amber . not much head - could be due to pour .	000000000000000
1	appearance : it pours a crystal clear deep garnet topped with an inch of tight white head that tends to linger nicely , followed by lacing that sticks to the glass all the way down to the finish .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : clear straw yellow with a snow white head which does not last long .	0000000000000000
1	a : insane carbonation , very difficult to pour . bottle cap flew off with the loudest pop i 've ever heard from a beer bottle . light amber with tons of rising carbonation . sea foam head .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : the head retention is horrible , as soon as the head forms it makes a soda like crackle and then disappears . light weathered golden hue and great clarity which is not a surprise to me .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : the pour gives a 0.3 '' off white head that gradually falls back , though never quite all the way ... leaving a nice layer behind for awhile . the beer is a bright medium amber in color .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a deep ruby red with a thick off-white head that slowly fades .	000000000000000
1	a : coppery orange . a translucent haze makes it glow in the light . frothy head has good retention , and leaves decent lacing behind . s/t/m : smell basically reflects a more alcoholic form of the taste . bitterness right away , smoothed out quickly by a large dose of fresh sticky honey . a little alcohol on that initial bitter kick . citric , floral , bitter hops slide in on the finish along with a big alcohol presence . not for the faint of heart .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a deep dark maroon with flash of head that disappeared before i set the bottle down . no lace .	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this beer came out of the tap jet black , with a head that almost made me weep right there on my barstool . it rose up huge , being rocky and fluffy both at the same time . it took its sweet time settling down , leaving some serious lace coating the glass . in a nutshell , this beer was beautiful .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : dark gold , slighty hazy beer with a beautiful thick , sticky ivory cap with good retention and fantastic lacing .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a smooth black with a good 2-3 fingers of khaki brown colored head .	00000000000000000
1	appearance : nice dark -- pretty much black -- small surprisingly light colored head . minimal lacing . has a thin appearance .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : i ca n't say this is much of a looker . opaque unripened plum color . the head disappeared as fast as it was produced and thus no lacing . 4.5	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : golden copper hue . clear . lots of carbonation . slightly off white head , which is full and robust . the meringue-y head stays well , only diminishing to a collar near the end of the glass . excellent lacing . it 's a shame the beer is all downhill from here .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : piss colored ( duh ) and poor head retention with not much lacing .	0000000000000000
1	appearance : black and thick . there 's a surprisingly `` large '' head that is very dense with small bubbles , and it sticks around for a while . finally after about a half an hour , it 's totally gone .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark and roasted coffee lacing with a pitch dark chocolate brown color to match the head . lacing is like cake .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours black with ruby around the edges of the glass . a thin tan head caps the beer , but dissipates very quickly . almost no lacing is left behind . appearance leaves more to be desired .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : so much has been written about lost abbey 's penchant for undercarbonating some of its beer ... well , this is undercarbonated ! not quite 'flat ' , as there 's a brief skim of fizzy khaki , but the scattered glints of twinkling bubbliness breaking an otherwise still surface ca n't be the intent here . plenty dark , really close to black and impenetrable keeps the score from dipping lower . no lace whatsoever .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : definitely black , no question about it . decent head , but not quite as other imperial stouts . lacing shows good initial retention but appears a tad watery and dies soon .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : darker than straw , poured a one-finger-thick head that , well , quickly is overused ... speedily ? hurridly ? dissipated , leaving no lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : deep black in color with a thick 2 '' + head that looked like a dollop of chocolate mousse , very frothy and creamy looking .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a murky , hazy , fully opaque yellowish orange color with a good inch of stiff , fluffy , off-white head . excellent retention and copious amounts of lacing . if this beer tastes as good as it looks , its going to be one hell of a beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : corked 750 , no cage , cork rotting on top after removing foil cover , carefully removing the cork a portion of it stayed in the bottle & effected the pour . a few very small fragments of cork ended up in the glass . crystal clear with the appropriate pour but slightly darker than a typical gueuze , think esb color .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : very rapidly dissipating head . red with a tinge of orange , a little cloudy , although i tried to leave most of the yeast behind in the bottle .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a ruby/brown color with a very short-lived white head . no lacing and plenty of carbonation .	00000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured into a tulip glass , this was a beautiful opaque mahogany brew with a frothy light-tan head . the color combination between the beer and the head is terrific ... looks sexy as hell . great solid lacing , too .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours deep dark brownish black hue . there was no head , no carbonation , and no lace .	000000000000000000000
