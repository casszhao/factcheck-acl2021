1	a : deep , deep copper color almost like a medium colored iced tea . small off white head that quickly fades to a tiny lace . good .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : dark amber in color , nice white fluffy head , ok retention , very nice lacing .	0000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear golden straw . it is an extremely pale yellow , with only about 1/2 finger of pure white head . the foam settles quickly on this brew .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : this poured a muddy dark mahogany with no head . not the most attractive sight .	000000000000000000

1	a : cloudy lemon / straw color with active carbonation up the middle . huge fluffy white head that lingers and lingers , leaving thick lacing down the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : nice golden orange hue . copper highlights . appears the color of southern sweet tea when the light hits it right . fluffy head dwindles to a thin layer rather quickly . a halo of foam hangs on for the life of the beer . head retention could be better .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : cola colored . clean with burgundy highlights . poor carbonation , very fizzy ( like cola ) with a rapidly depleting head .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : pitch-black beer . light brown head that pours about a half finger , but stays about a half a finger nail the whole way down . with a good amount of lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : surprisingly attractive , light golden , with a billowy long lasting head	00000000000000
1	a : pours a very pale yellow with a large cap of foam after gushing out of the big mouth bottle into a pint glass . surprisingly good head retention , light spotty lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : cant really see into the can but from what i do remember pouring into a glass , its very , very , and i mean very light , pale yellow .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pretty bad , even for a happoshu . head is akin to that on a diet sprite : white and so fizzy you hardly have time to notice it before it disappears . body is a weirdly glowing orangey yellow .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours hazy light bronze colour , somehow the barman failed to pour this beer properly and the beerhead was overly limited , unlike what one would expect of a good belgian ale ... besides , the serving temp . was a bit too low .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a half finger head of nice white colour , milky lactic cream , and restrained thickness . colour is a transparent gold . sm : cream , full expressive barley , slight bittering hops , and pleasant golden grain . a very nice aroma . moderate in strength .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : upon untwisting the cage , i fell into a delirious spell as the cork wooshed by my nose at breakneck yet slow-motion speeds a la the matrix . i 'm lucky to still have my sight . after the gushing subsides , this pours a mostly opaque , muddy copper . 4-finger ( yup ) head dies down to 1 , leaving lacing on the glass . as this almost killed me , i must dock it 1 whole extra point .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pale , yellow , fizzy , highly carbonated . virtually no head and even csi would not be able to find any trace of lacing . so far , so bad .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : nice looking beer . it is dark , but not jet , black topped with a beautiful tan head . very picturesque .	0000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : white head that dissipates almost immediately . a lot of tiny bubbles rushing to the top of the pint glass . the color of the beer is a very light gold color that is transparent . i got some decent lacing on the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear golden pour . initially a fluffy white head that dissipates quickly and leaves no lacing .	0000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured into one of the glasses from the gift pack a wonderful reddish amber . a foamy half inch head forms and eventually fades to a tight ring around the glass . lacing is patchy and sparse .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : when poured , this beer produces a gorgeous ruby red body and a fluffy pink head . beautiful .	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours out thick black and produces a three finger , thick mocha colored head with great retention . head cascades up from the netherworld . jet black body with no carbonation evident . head slowly fades to a good film and clings to the sides of the glass . a swirling wisp and a ring remain until the end leaving lots some dots of lacing down the glass . a beauty of a stout and much like the base beer , though the lacing is not quite as perfect .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : big tan head on this beer , 3-fingers worth . its frothily and fluffy like a cloud . it sits on top of a somewhat cloudy beautiful orange beer , visible carbonation though the haze .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : dark brown	0000
1	appearance : this was a hazey , amber-orange beer with lots of chunks of yeast floating throughout . the cream colored head rose up big ( up and out that is ; i should pay better attention ) . it was fluffy and dense , settling down very slowly and leaving a lot of lace . the beer looked good , but it was all downhill from there .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : the beer looked really good . amber color , on the darker side . head was a little off white and carbonation was definitely present . head dissipated pretty quickly , but left behind a faint lace .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : dark burnt orange/copper-hued beer ; bright clarity , with a nice dense cream cap with good retention . medium-high carbonation and some decent retention .	000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : golden body , small white head , no real lacing .	0000000000000

0	a : pours a ( not surprisingly ) opaque black color with a nice tan head that quickly fades to a thin ring around the perimeter of the glass . leaving no lacing behind .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark black body with a touch of dark drown along the edges . head is fluffy dark mocha at three fingers . retention is decent and without lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy , pretty orange/copper body with a fairly persistent two finger yellowed white head . unappealing were the 20 or so small , light colored sheet-like flecks that settled to the bottom of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : nearly black-brown body with cherry hues and a brown head .	0000000000000

0	a : pours a dark amber with a hint of orange , fast retreating tan head left so fast , i almost missed it . no lacing either . ar . sweet , spices , fruit , maybe a twinge of vanilla and of course alcohol are present . the sweetness reminds me of honey .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pale brown to amber with about one finger of off white head , head sticks around with lots of great lacing ,	000000000000000000000000

0	a : small white head . traditional golden color . a little bit hazy .	000000000000000

0	appearance : amber in color , hazy . great white head that laces nicely and lasts throughout	00000000000000000

0	a : this beer looks okay but i found a little lacking with head retention . sometimes it is easy to tell a beer that was brewed in large batches .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : slightly hazy , light amber color with over one finger of diminishing white foam head . scant lacing remains on the glass .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : very dark coal color with a very thin creamy tan head . small amount of lace around the edges	000000000000000000000
1	a : poured into a traditional pint glass . appeared a clear , orangy-copper with a heavy amount of white and big bubbled foamy head , which remained well .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a nice orange hue that is gently hazy with two fingers of ample , pure white head that lingers beautifully and leaves a nice amount of lacing on the glass	000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours dark and heavy with a thick head .	00000000000
0	a : extremely pale , golden yellow color with a one and half finger head of frothy white foam that settles to a bubbly coating , leaving minimal soapy lace . bud light with better head retention ?	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very light amber , translucent . two-finger head of foam that lingers .	000000000000000
1	a : dark , black coffee , espresso-crema colored head , good lacing on the sides of the glass .	00000000000000000000
1	a : pours an opaque dark brown body in the glass with two fingers of fluffy , long-lasting , light mocha head . i 'm inclined to think it 's infected , seeing how ... . robustly carbonated it is .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear dark copper body and a cappuccino colored head with good lacing .	000000000000000
0	a : orange copper body , extremely clear with an obvious filtered nature to it . no head , no retention , no lacing . talk about a lackluster looking beer , this is just pretty sad .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : lager appearance , not red	0000000
1	a : pale , filtered beer . carbonation produces a good but short lived head .	0000000000000000
1	a : pours a deep hazy murky shade of brown , with a big luscious light brown head on top , thick and full , two fingers worth . picture-perfect .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear pale golden/orange amber color with lots of visible bubbles quickly rising to the top . head formation is a nice fluffy 1+ finger 's worth , off white in color . good retention and tons of sticky white lacing all around - sierra nevada is good at that .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : cloudy gold body with yeast particles floating around . two fingers of thick froathy white head . head retains for the full drink and leaves lots of lacing . could n't look any better !	0000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : pale moon pours a copper color with about a half-finger of slightly off-white head . retention and lacing are both poor .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : very pale , neither head nor lacing .	0000000000
1	a : wonderful cloudy golden color , with a big pillowy off-whitehead . head stays for awhile , lacing is excellent down the side of the glass . tasty .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : surprisingly light in color , like a lovely amber . have yet to taste raison d'tre , so maybe that 's why i did n't know what to expect . thought it would look more like port .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy red/brown color . poured a 1 finger tan head that dissipated quickly . broken , thin and uneven lacing . almost unappealing flat look .	0000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : thanks to the huge amount of carbonation , this one was a gusher that i was able to salvage ( for the most part ) - however , it did mean i got a huge , frothy head out of the pour . clean ( re not much sediment ) , golden-orange body . ok , it could be better though - i would like to see how this one pours without the quick , over-carbonated pour .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours pale golden color with a fine fluffy head with little bubbles sugesting a lot of carbination in this one	0000000000000000000000
0	a : dark coulored foam , almost like chocolate mousse . the fluid is like dark , almost like coffe . only half a centimeter of head .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : lake erie monster pours a glowing golden straw color with a nice 2 finger creamy tan head . slightly hazy and some decent window drapes of lace .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy , orange color . light , off-white head . the beer actually cleared after it warmed up a bit . surely lagunitas would n't make a beer with chill haze ? ( 2.5 )	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : thick as whole milk , black as night . imaginary carbonation .	00000000000000
1	a : clear deep ruby-orange brew with a fair amount of carbo floating lazily upward . modest 1/2 '' of tan head settles to a thick single layer that hugs the glass a bit . decent lace .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : despite letting the beer sit , undisturbed , for days in the fridge and despite a careful pour , it winds up a very murky , dark raspberry red in my glass . there is n't much carbonation aside from a very thin collar at the edge of the glass . no lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : the head dissolves very quickly , leaving a urine colored body and some lacing . lots of carbonation bubbles rise to the surface .	00000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : it is very consistent to the dry stout style . the color is jet black with a creamy tan head . the head is retained through the duration of the beer with good lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a rather unappealing pale , semi cloudy , yet clear yellow with a white head that quickly dissipates to a ring with one or two streaks of lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : jet black , brown head with good retention , the way a proper porter should look	000000000000000000
0	a : poured a murky reddish-brown hue with a very modest caramel head . the color of the liquid reminded me of a glass of water from the muddy missouri river during spring run-off season . the closer the glass is held to backlighting a ruddy red emerges as the dominate hue . the head receded quickly leaving a thin cover over the liquid and a ring around the collar .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy , dark brown , very dark . the pour only produced about a half finger of kahki head that quickly receeded and left no lace .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark brown with an beige head . not much lacing on the glass , and none on the head which subsides very quickly . very clear .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a slightly cloudy dark amber , with a thick rich head .	00000000000000
1	a : pale golden color , thick head , good cap , good lacing .	000000000000000
0	appearance : beer pours a medium-straw color , very plain , light carbonation . head is virtually non-existent , even with a fairly heavy pour .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a brilliantly clear ruby red with a frothy , slightly pink head that retains well and leaves good lace .	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : perfectly clear golden-amber in color . a slow and gentle pour left me with four fingers of frothy head that 's barely contained by the glass . the body reveals a massive torrent of tiny bubbles feeding the head . as the head recedes ( which takes a long time ) it leaves chunky sheets of lace all over the glass . a beautiful beer for sure .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : apple juice-like with little head .	00000000
1	a : wow , i 've never seen a beer with a head like this one . it was easily 4+ fingers tall . it filled 1/2 of my pint glass with a meringue like bright white head . i did not use an aggressive pour because i was trying not to get any trub in my glass . the label says not to be too delicate with the pour so as to `` create a luxurious head . '' i definitely saw that . the meringue like head stayed around for the whole 750 ml bottle . it was easy to refresh the head with each pour . ( 3 times in total . ) the beer color was a cloudy bright yellow . kind of like if you mixed a bmc & a witbier .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : the beer pours a nice amber color , a little dark amber , no real head to speak of and no lacing ...	0000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours an opaque brown with ruby highlights . the head is about 1/2 '' , off-white and shows very little retention . barely any lace is left on the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours an orange color , very littel head , no lacing . looks a little flat to me .	000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a murky orange hue , with a thing white head , that dissipates very quick into a nonexistent presence . floating pieces of marshmallow show it 's present in the visual . medium levels of carbonation .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a fizzy straw color . a very thin foam that does n't last past the pour . beer is brilliantly clear . with a little lasting foam , this would be a stunner .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : transparent golden to yellow color . one finger head vanished quickly and left very little lacing down the mug .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : one for the ages . gorgeous honeyed deep , deep amber with a dense off-white head . great retention .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a hazy ruddy color ( the liquid looks like white zinfandel ) with a lovely head that retains incredibly well and thoroughly laces the glass	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : it poured a dark black that when back lit had a slight ruby hue around the edges . there was a wonderfully dark caramel head that receded quickly leaving a slight collar around the rim of the brew .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : gorgeous pour and nice creamy head . super-dark all the way through , disguising the sediment that must be swimming around in this . flavor : assault of oak . a lot of zin on the back end , along with all the attendant dark fruit flavors you 'd expect in that profile . sourness and acidity are too timid and get lost in an almost goodyear-strength rubber taste . complexity is apparent , but really difficult to unravel . suggests a need for further aging .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : very clear goldenrod body with a fleeting , off white , sudsy , two finger head . unappealing small 'clumps ' formed in the head , persisting for quite a while , leaving me to believe they were particulate in nature when they were apparently not .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a very deep , golden color . the best way i could describe it is cut , wet hay . plenty of bubbly carbonation working it 's way to the top of the brew . not too much of a head to speak of . i did n't really pour it that aggressively though since i was drinking it from a tulip glass and doubted that a large head would fit without exploding over and flooding my kitchen in sticky suds ... what i did get was about a fingers worth of white , fluffy suds that floated on top like a boat in calm waters . did n't stick around for all that long . gone and lonely in about a minute flat .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a murkey orange/apricot color with a full fluffy white head .	00000000000000
0	appearance : not as cloudy as it should be . medium sized head that dissipates fast .	00000000000000000
1	a : black as night poured out a huge head with tiny bubbles this thing looks great ! the head was even brown ! great look !	000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : golden , always beautiful , f ... ing gold	00000000000
0	appearance : thin straw colored with a fizzy small head , one guy put it well by saying it looked like ginger ale , though i think it 's lighter smell/taste : imagine you drink a budweiser then you fill the glass with water , that 's exactly what bud select is	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a cloudy , deep burgundy . it 's topped by a fluffy , two-finger , pink head that sticks around as a quarter-inch layer .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : mobile 1 with an effervescent head .	000000000
0	a : pale yellow , crystalline , i could see my face reflected in my pils glass , small foamy head and lots of bubbles ;	00000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a clear , reddish ale with just a little tint of purple , the head really stood out , it was bright and white like puffed rice .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pale orange , slight haze ; thick layer of yellowy , spongey foam with good head retention	0000000000000000000
0	a : clear and yellow , like most macros . heavy carbonation , thin/dissolving head . 1/5	00000000000000000
0	a : moderate pour yields a .5 finger fine white head with decent retention . beer is a cloudy , unfiltered orangy-yellow . lacing is spotty at best with little cling .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very cloudy light orange yellow color with a lot of yeast chunks floating around . a very small white head rests on top .	00000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a beautiful red/orange color with a creamy off-white head . in fact the color of this beer is one of its better traits . these are very traditional colors for a west coast imperial ipa , and also very similar in color to the mikkeller ipa ( which is also from denmark ) . it has a solid three fingers of head as well . every time i pour more into the glass i get another two or three fingers of head . there 's also a really impressive amount of lacing . very nice !	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a nice ivory puff of head over a clear golden color . wonderfully frothy retention and good puffs of lace . all fitting for the style .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : this strong lager starts with a big head with sadly little or no head retention . the color is kind of a limpid , not at all interesting , yellow . very little carbonation .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : the beer looked so nice in an avery pint glass on their website , that i too had to put it in a standard american pint glass . i did n't have an avery pint glass , so i had to use a bell 's brewery pint glass . same thing , different label . the beer looks much nicer in real life than on a website page . the beer was a dark mahogany brown with plenty of cranberry red highlights all through out the beer . if that was n't enough , it had a long lasting beige head of foam that left tons of beige colored sticky lace around the glass . the beer looked just as nice as the label on the bottle did .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : there was literally no head whatsoever , and very little carbonation . it looked like a glass of apple juice .	00000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a slight white fizzy head that quickly retreats to not even a slick cap no lacing what so ever , pissy yellow with alot of bubbles breaking the surface .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear amber body with an amazingly long lasting off-white head .	0000000000000
1	appearance : pours a quarter-inch foam head that vanishes very quickly . you can hear and see carbonation , but that too seems to be gone once the pour is done . very amber , murky look .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear light amber with two-finger , white , foamy head that lasted more than a few minutes . phenomenal lacing .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a lightly hazy golden pale color with a huge 3 finger fluffy white pillow of foam . amazing lace , how sweet the sound !	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the brown ale is a full reddish brown color , dark enough to be opaque . on closer inspection , ruby red highlights emerge . a thin band of head hangs around the edges of the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the appearance of this beer is just awesome . it is a deep ruby red color topped with a frothy light tan head . visible carbonation keeps the head bubbling .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured a dark brown color with no head/lacing down the glass	0000000000000
1	a : poured into a tumbler with a 2 finger creamy head . great clear golden color and lots of carbonation activity .	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : dark , leathery brown with a magnificent mocha head . it 's so thick and creamy , and such a pleasant color .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a golden , light amber . did n't get much head , but a bit definitely formed after the pour . probably needed to age my bottle some more . really impressed with the artwork & description on the bottle ( in all honestly : that 's most of the reason why i bought it ; the other is i wanted a new brew to try out ) .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : clear with a light caramel and orange color . nothing too fancy going on here . head is retained for 5-7 minutes .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : well . . . its less than epic . pours an incredibly , crystal clear orange hue . held to the light , you get more of an orange tinged yellow color . a pretty good amount of carbonation activity in that clear body . the pour yielded a finger or so of white head , but it quickly fell to a thin white ring . that ring tries what it can with some lace , but really to no avail . i am a bit worried .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a black with a hint of red , about 2 fingers worth of than tan head that settles to a ring.. very nice lacing from start to finish . i will say it does not pour like guinness.. not as pretty .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pale lemony yellow colour . high carbonation . reasonable head which disappears quickly . no lacing .	0000000000000000000
1	a : slightly cloudy , honey color . very appetizing .	00000000000
1	appearance : pours a clear amber color with a magnificent head that sticks and curtains the pint glass	000000000000000000
1	appearance : the kalamzoo is an exceptionally dark stout . while you can occasionally find a light stout that you can see light through amongst american craft brew stouts , bell 's has made an exceptionally dark stout . the head of the brew , while light in volume due to the pour from the bottle , is even dark for a stout , and of comparable brown color to other american crafts or british porters . lacing is light but visible . red hues can only be seen around the base of the glass when held up to light .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a glowing but dark amber color , browner towards the top . head is bubbly , tannish , fairly thick but quick to recede . plenty of carbonation visible on the sides of the glass , but this disappears quickly .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a light golden color with almost no head . leaves a small amount of lacing . carbonation is medium .	00000000000000000000000
0	appearance : looks like soda , with a huge reddish-brown head that fizzes away completely leaving neither foam nor lace above the espresso brown colored liquid	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : those widgets are so annoying . you hardly get the top popped and it shoots it 's load . typical jet black guinness look with big white fine creamy head . not much in the lacing department but i do like that a small head stays throughout and gives you a creamy milk mustache . i love that classic settling that guinness does . you have to admit that it is a good looking drink .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a dark brown with orange highlights . the beer is transparent , with a huge , 5 '' tall , exploding out of the tulip , tan head . it shows great retention . extremely thick lace coats the sides of the glass . bubbles carve out the holes in the lace .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : short lived white head on a pale , very clear , amber with wide yellow edges . head dies quickly leaving only feeble carbonation streams to show any sign of life . flavor : some sweet malt and firm grape/grape jam flavors . overall very mild and clean , a good crowd pleaser but doesnt do much for me .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured a straw color but was not very hazy at all . very clear for hefe with little to no debris . not what you expect when you pick up a hefe .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours with 4 full fingers of very dark brown head . difficult to tell where the head stops and the beer begins . this settles slowly , eventually falling to a still substantial 1 finger coating of foam . nice lacing . the beer itself is black and thick , not even a hint of light around the edges . fair amount of sediment in the bottle .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a thin , half-finger head . obviously , this is a result of its cask serving , so it 's forgivable . hazy yellow colour . sm : strong scent of lemon . souring hops aplenty .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours an unattractive dijon mustard yellow/brown with 4 fingers of white head that recedes into a thin cap with a little lacing .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : pitch black with a light brown head . lots of yeast in the bottle that forms an oily coating on the sides of the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a bright , see-through golden body wit a thin , off-white head .	0000000000000000
1	a : cloudy apricot . short white head , frothy . not much retention but a bit of lacing .	00000000000000000000
0	a : veyr pale straw color with thin white head that does leave a little lace	0000000000000000
0	appearance : not really an amber color ; more of just orangey-yellow .	0000000000000
0	a : green . mildly impressed that they got it to look so much like ecto cooler . all they need is to have slimer on the bottle .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy honey color with a minimal thin white head .	000000000000
1	appearance : it pours from the can like chocolate milk , in about 30 seconds an inch and a half creamy head forms . the nitro can makes this a damn beautiful beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a murky brown with two fingers of tan head that recedes into a foamy ring with little lacing .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : pours an amber/red with 1 finger of foamy head that leaves some good lacing . n : sweet breadiness and lemon .	000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured from the 12 oz bottle into a pint glass . the beer is a crystal clear brownish orange color with a decent sized foamy head that is off-white . very plain looking beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a slight haze stricken dark amber , near brown , beer . pours a decent white foam head that settles to a mere whisp of what it was .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours dark translucent brown . no head . no lacing . at first could n't spot any bubbles at all but managed to see a few breaking the surface every few seconds .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : this beer poured rather syrupy out of the bottle . there was some yeast/cherry juice or something in the bottom of the bottle . it looked like mud . i made sure to swirl this around and get it into my glass . the beer did not pour with any head or lacing what so ever . it has a nice black color with lots of dark red tones .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : it 's a beautiful orange hue that is crystal clear with loads of carbonation rushing up from the bottom of the glass . the lacing is good and the head has tightly packed bubbles of froth and about a half inch thick .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a clear golden color with a massive head that sticks well and leaves shards of lace	0000000000000000000
1	a : deep amber brown with a foamy coffee head and sticky lacing	0000000000000
1	appearance : pale golden color , with great head retention and good lacing .	00000000000000
1	a : perfect . very dark ruby/mahogany color , relatively clear with persistent carbonation . a very bready , yellowish tan head that is very thick and never really goes anywhere and clumps to glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a surprisingly clear amber body with a couple of inches of head in my jar . retains poorly , but it deposits substantial , sticky head on the sides as it goes . the remainder is a swirl of bubbles on the brew with a moderate collar , which leaves more sticky lace as the brew vanishes .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark brown with an orange/red hue . one finger of head that dissipates in a few minutes . still , after 15 minutes a slight head remains . in fact , this head remains through the very last sip . impressive ! sufficient streaking down the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : opaque black , decent tan head , good lacing .	000000000000
1	appearance : pours pitch black , with one finger of some of the darkest brown head i 've ever seen . the head dissipated surprisingly slowly , and left blankets of lacing . about as good as an imperial stout can look .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : super opaque brown with only scattered head . looks like poop water .	000000000000000
1	a : dark , like a winter sea on a new moon eve . porcelain colored head that is truly whipped cream in consistency .	0000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a pale , dull golden color with a thin quickly disappearing head and very little lace .	0000000000000000000
1	a : cloudy orange/yellow and amber . lots of lacing with hardly any head with the pour . looks great .	000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a slightly hazy orange/amber color with a small fizzy head that rises and falls very quickly to leave behind a fizzy island and a thin ring . no lacing left behind on the edges of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : looks pretty impressive . rich , deep brown color , with mahogany highlights . a quarter of slightly tan , white head appears , recedes to a thick rim and leaves some streaky lace .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : murky light brown with a tangerine tint , some bubbles apparent , but virtually no head .	0000000000000000000
0	a : a dark amber , about the color of grade `` a '' maple syrup . a creamy white quarter inch head forms but quickly degrades into a spattering of larger bubbles that tend to stick to the side of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : deep dark brown/black body , pours very oily thick and sludgy like motor oil . absolutely no had on this , other than some thick spit bubbles around the edges . no retention or lace , naturally . it 's not that high in alcohol to expect no head , so i 'm hoping this is n't under carbonated .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a burnt sienna color with a stark white head , not quite an inch or so that recedes to a thin cap of bubbles and a few chunks of lacing . fairly cloudy . a few spots of lacing as the head recedes . not a bad looking beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : gusher . this thing basically converts to foam the moment it leaves the bottle , creating a billowing , 4 '' foam presence in my glass with just the barest hint of liquid beneath it . ridiculous .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a pallid yellow into a glass , with really no head to speak of , dissipates quickly leaving only a small , thin ring of clear foam around the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark red brown with a full white head , very good head retention and lace .	00000000000000000000
1	appearance : wowzer , very sexy looking blonde head ( err ... dirty blonde ) , very thick and creamy like . nose mild sweet smells , roasted coffee and chocolate ( i like it so far , i sure hope it tastes like it smells ) . palate : ok , this is where i got lost completely , it tastes like water , very thin watered down coffee , it 's like ordering up a `` iced venti single latte with only 1/2 caff and 1/2 decaf with 4oz 's of milk and alot of water '' .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : deep clear brown - almost pecan in color . no head to speak of .	00000000000000000
1	appearance : hazy peach gold glass topped by a fluffy 4 finger head at the pour . head settles down after a bit and leaves clumps of lace . the color has a really nice translucent candle lit glow . pretty . flavor : citric flavors jump right out . where the nose was lime rind , the taste is fresh lime flesh ( i know it is lemon and orange peel , but it tastes lime ) . the other spices blend nicely . the alcohol peeks out and is just a touch hot , but not bad .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a dark amber color with a massive and insanely dense head that leaves a ton of lacing behind . beautiful .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : beautiful , foamy head . lacing that lasts longer than the serving . deep hazy gold to rust spectrum . a marvel .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a very copper/brown color , hazy , with a thick bubbly off-white head on top . it left nice lacing on my glass as i worked through the bottle . well done .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a black color with a 3 '' fluffy head that lasts a while . nice lacing paints the glass .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : a decently colored dark , brownish amber . nothing too special but nothing really boring either .	0000000000000000000
1	a : guinness always looks great ! the head is very thick and creamy and never fades . i have never had a glass so coated with foam when i am done drinking .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours an oily thick black with a nice 1 finger head . very viscous looking stout . brown head leaves lacing all over the glass . the legs on this one are thick !	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : medium copper with a reddish hue under a pathetic off-white head that looked as substantial as the head from pouring pepsi . no lacing .	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : bright copper body topped with a loose tan two finger head of moderate retention that leaves moderate lacing and a thin bubbly cover .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : the head on this beer is extremely dense . two toned with dark and light mocha . this beer has been sitting out for 30min in glass and still has a head . i am impressed . some sticky spotty lacing . dark brown , almost black but not quit there .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : very dark amber but i did n't get much of a head out of this one . lacing is also pretty thin .	0000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a one finger medium looking beige mocha colored head that makes a lot of crackling noises . fades relatively fast to a small ring only . black with little carbonation , though some bubbles decorate the top . a ring remains but leaves no lacing down the sides . somewhat underwhelming .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured a dark transparent amber color . very little head , no lacing observed and a moderate amount of carbonation .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : pours clear golden with a large creamy white head that takes some time to sink . leaves decent lacings .	0000000000000000000000
0	appearance : murky , pale , pale gold . no head and an ever so slight amount of carbonation .	00000000000000000000
0	a : pours with a real nasty head , creats large bubbles that look almost soapy . but quickly dissipate into a nice enough head . nothing special though . decent lacing and the color is pitch balck . gottafix that soapy head look , not very appetizing ...	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : murky , dark amber with shallow , off-white head	00000000000
1	a : reddish amber color . huge 3 finger pillowy tan head . 4.5	00000000000000
1	appearance : a beautiful copper/amber . i love the bleach white lace that surrounds this beer . looks fantastic	0000000000000000000
1	a : black body with a perfect inch of creamy brown foam ; awesome , especially for 10 % .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a slightly hazy bronzed straw color in to a pilsner glass . there is only splotches of foam on the surface of the beer and no lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : great deep amber with active head that dies back down to a luscious and lasting creamy foam with great lacing . very appetizing looking esb .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : because of the widget and the nitro can , there 's obviously a ton of creaminess and thickness to the brew , with a head that stays at about 1 '' and the lacing that 's just as thick that stays down the whole glass the beer 's consumed . the body seems opaque but it 's more of a very very dark amber color when you shine some light on it .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : cloudy brown with a short 1/2 '' head . no lacing develops during the session .	000000000000000000
0	appearance : dark , roasted chestnut brown body with a small , tan beige head with mediocre retention .	0000000000000000000
1	a : huge white frothy head over translucent golden . the head takes its time to mellow out , and retention is frothy .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : a murky brown liquid with serious thickness and reddish highlights . the thin head dissipates quickly leaving a few small trails of tiny bubbles rising through the beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : giddily chromatic , which leaves this soft ringed froth for you to muscle out . not to die for , but looks never were for the ones with integrity ; i like those kinds of people .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured a deep amber color with a decent , but slightly thin head . should have been a little darker .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : love the semitransparent amber color and the lacing ; hard not to score this a 5.0 on appearance	00000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dark amber-orange . small ring of foam remained throughout drinking .	000000000000000
1	appearance : a monster three finger head that has really good retention . the color of the head is a light tan color that is foamy creamy , and bubbly . the color of the beer is a deep reddish cherry hue with garnet highlights . the clarity of the beer is near opaque , except there is some visibility . the head left a lot of lacing on the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : the highlight of the beer is the beautiful way it fills the pint glass . soft , creamy head that leaves a bit of lacing behind	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : deep chestnut brown pour , off white head . beer foam is quite persistent , leaving spotty sticky lacing down the sides of my tulip glass . this ale is clear when held to the light , and exhibit a extremely dark cherry brown color .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : nice hazy red/yellow/rust body with fluffy bubbly white head	00000000000
1	appearance : pours with a thin head that dissipates rather quickly , & a clear , shallow red color .	00000000000000000000
0	a : pours a super dark muddy brown color ; one finger-width head , light lacing . overall an unappealing color	000000000000000000000
0	a : dark brown almost black , small tan head dissipates quickly and settles into the smallest of rings . no real lacing , no retention , and very small legs . not off to a good start .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a slightly hazy gold-orange with two fingers of white head that recedes into a thin ring with a little lacing .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : light amber color unusual for typically straw colored ale . beer appears flat . no head , rare bottom origin bubbles .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : first of all let me remark on the color of this beer . it 's a really red mahogany color . it has gorgeous red accents and excellent clarity . 2+ fingers of tan fluffy white head . excellent lacing already present . i feel like i 've been giving a lot of 4.5/5.0s lately for appearance but if you have a gorgeous color , tan fluffy head that sticks around and great lacing ... what more could you ask for ?	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : black with a really nice off white/tan head , great lacing , ca n't wait to taste .	00000000000000000000
1	a : pours a tangerine copper with some clarity but mostly glowing . nice head on the pour with lots of retention and lacing .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : looks promising -- hazy apricot with ample foam . but no , it 's all downhill from the looking stage ...	00000000000000000000000
1	a : a large , 4 finger head erupts on the pour . pristinely white , fluffy and frothy . the body is a light shade of golden yellow . thousands of bubbles can be seen rushing at a fast and constant pace through the clear body . very good lacing in the form of chunky sea foam . an absolute stunner in the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a clear orange color with a 4 '' tall cream colored head . great retention on these foamy bubbles . tons of sticky lace .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours very dark and still with surprisingly little anything going on , on top of the beer . there are a few bubbles rising , but they do n't stick at all . this beer seriously looks like a day-old coke with no ice . unfortunately there was a decent pop when i popped the cap , so i guess it is supposed to look like this . quite disappointing as i do n't want any style beer to look this still in the glass . i guess i will give it a bit of credit as it does n't look like mud in my glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dark brown with three fingers of tan head that vanishes completely with no lacing .	0000000000000000000
1	appearance : golden with a huge head .	00000000
0	appearance : pours a cloudy golden yellow with a slightly orange haze . the white head rises about 1/4 '' and fades rather quickly . no lace remains on the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours with a bright white bubbly head that struggles to get up to 1 finger . medium retention leaves a thin , sudsy film . the body is pale golden straw , clear and very light in color . super thin sheets of lace with tattered ends . nothing particularly great about the appearance but , given the style , nothing exciting was expected . s &	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : thick black color . did n't get much foam , which was surprising	000000000000000
0	a : light brown with a touch of burnt orange . no carbonation and translucent . i do not like the looks of this .	0000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a deep dark black color . there is a quarter inch finger head that is dark tan . the head has no retention to it . there is no clarity to the beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : clear and golden with big bubbles and an off-white head with poor retention . it almost looks like a pilsener .	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a nicely hazy golden-straw body capped by about three fingers of white head that fade slowly and leave great lacing .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : this one gets a five for presentation as much as anything . poured into the distinctive kwak glass ( google it ) and placed in its wooden holder , it 's an impressive sight . the colour is a translucent reddish brown reminiscent of an amber ale . some lacing on the side .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a relatively thick , inky black . a gentle pour produced a light tan lace ring around the edge , so i can imagine a vigorous pour might actually produce a full-covering head , which would be surprising for a brew of this abv . it sits in the glass looking dark and menacing , with absolutely no light penetration . i usually judge beers this dark by tilting the glass and looking up through the diagonal edge to see how much light can get through : not even the most tilted , shallow depths would allow the hint of any light . impressive .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : as you can see by the photograph , a light yellow . the head is not impressive , and leaves no lacing .	0000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pink brown body , opaque , no head at all . actually pretty ugly .	00000000000000000
0	appearance : southern tier said that the proper glassware for this beer is a fluted glass . so i poured this beer into a unibroue fluted glass . this cherry saison poured an almost clear light tangerine orange color . it was very light in color . the head of foam on this beer was lackluster . at the height , the head of foam was less than 1/2 an inch in height and white in color . i did n't get a real good look at it because it quickly fizzled away into a few white rings and one single spot of white lace . as you can tell , i was n't impressed at all by the appearance .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : served out of one of those aluma-bottles . straw colored , transparent body . white soapy head . pours out pretty nice then recedes to a filmy thin layer . not bad retention either and minimal stickiness of the head -- not enough to leave anything clung to the glass at the end of the drink .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : vigorous pour gave me lots of haze on the yellow-orange body and a marshmallow fluff head . speckles of lacing and never ending carbonation . a thing of beauty- wish i poured into into duvel glass for full enjoyment .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a mahogany color with very little head and no lacing to speak of .	0000000000000000
0	appearance : deep rep-copper color with a slight haze and a wisp of off-white head that disappears quickly , leaving minimal lacing .	00000000000000000000000
0	appearance : 12oz bottle poured into standard pint glass . dark cloudy brown colour , thick fluffy head .	0000000000000000000
1	appearance : nice strong gold/brass coloring with an impressive head that lasts for a while . minimal beligian lacing after the head dissapates .	000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very light , clear . looks like a pinot grigio , but with carbonation and a delicate , white head .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a half finger head of slight cream , bad thickness , and okay retention . colour is a clear yellow-blonde . sm : lemon esters , fresh barley , and excellent orange peel . a moderate strength aroma .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : light copper color and its over carbonated . it almost spewed out of the bottle and upon the pour with an inch of beer in bottom the head was almost flowing out of the pint .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : the ale has the sickly red look of many kriek beers , sitting in my glass like a snifter of snapple strawberry kiwi . the bottle opened without much of a pop and did n't generate much head on pour . no lacing whatsoever .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : the brew poured a clear and transparent - but very dark - amber with hints of brown in there . a vigorous pour produced a rocky ivory-colored head of about 3 fingers . some visible carbonation floats , and as the beer is consumed , strings and rings of lacing drag the glass . very nice looking beer , i 'm really enjoying the color of it .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : very dark , light carbonated with not much of a head but a small foamy creamy tan head .	000000000000000000000
0	appearance : nice amber but the snow-globe of floaties that this brewery is known for . not much of a head and minimal lacing .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : slightly hazy , medium golden color with abundant white foam head that quickly deflates to sparse patches . almost no lacing remains on the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : brilliant gold with a small and fizzy white head that does n't stick around . leaves occasional spots of lace .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a rich honey gold color with a huge head the head is off white	00000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a pitch black color with a weird soapy head with only large bubbles . it is only 1/4 '' high , off-white in color with no retention or lace .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : light golden color with a single finger white foamy head which falls very quickly to a bubbly ring and no lace . looks kind of dead when you get to about a half glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : orangey and cloudy . no head . opaque	0000000000
1	a : wow , this is one of the best looking beers i have seen . color is mahogany . pours an excellent creamy head that lasts the whole beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this beer pours a hazy straw in color with a snow white 1 finger head . minimal lace after the head has faded .	00000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : 11.2 oz . brown bottle pours an alluring peach color . a solid two fingers of head appears that is extremely sticky , though it loses some volume and reduces moderately during consumption . label looks like something i doodled on my notebook in fifth grade , which adds a playful bit of anticipation to the whole endeavor .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark brown with a slight red hue , about 2inches of head that disappears and leaves minute lacing	00000000000000000000
0	a : is this a joke ? no head , slight lace at the top , otherwise , i 'm putting ice cubes in this for the iced tea experience .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : bright , hazy blond with a frothy cap of foam . incredible head retention ; it lasted for the entire hour i was sipping on this beer .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy gold with active initial carbonation and a lot of floating yeast . the small off-white head came and went quickly . left no lace .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a brown color , transparent , with orange edges and 2.5 '' light tan head . it shows good retention , with it 's pancake-like bubbles . very little lace .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the pour is rather thick , almost black with a fantastic head - very big , pale brown color , thick and very creamy ( almost reminiscent of a nitro-induced head ) . very good head retention . the beer looks really great . might be the best looking imperial stout i 've ever had .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours out a very light and transparent brown . yields a one finger , medium-thin looking . light tan head with half decent retention , fading down to a full wisp and ring . black body with little carbonation evident . a splotchy wisp and ring remain leaving some dots of lacing down the glass . too light and thin for the style , and the head was underwhelming as well .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : nice brown color with noticeable carbonation . nice , frothy , lasting head . beautiful looking beer .	00000000000000000000
0	a : i 've had some hotdog gushers before , but this beer was totally flat . a very dark color .	0000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a half finger off-white medium looking head with decent retention . tawny or burnt orange in color , perfectly clear with medium carbonation evident . very slim ring remains to the end and only leaves touches of lacing down glass . becomes slightly flat looking by the end of the pint .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a pale urine color with a half inch white head . foamy surface lingers for a bit and then settles to the miniscus . plenty of carbonation activity surfaces from the bottom of the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : held to light it 's a dark cola-brown , though it looks black enough otherwise . slight reddish tint , a swarm of carbonation ... but a also a fine cloud of suspended yeasty bits ( this is n't more than 4-5 months old ) . fairly strong head , a sandy-tan 1/2 finger at first , falls to a clinging ring and a couple small blots of film . almost no lace .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear straw-gold in the glass , with a light film that is surprisingly thin for a belgian tripel . i 'm attributing this to the barrel-aging , and i 'll give it a pass for now . no lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : crooked tree pours a murky dull colored pale that really darkens towards the center of the glass . cloudy with sediment . chunks alert ! a nice 2+ finger of khaki foam frothed about and seemed to have glimpses of light peach hues to it with some sporatic lace to my glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured a oil black colored with a tan head about 1/4 of an inch thick .	000000000000000000
1	a : the beer pours a nice bright golden color with a large 2 finger white head , and superb lacing ...	0000000000000000000000
0	a : amber classic tea color , not a representative head not retention and fast dissipation .	00000000000000000

1	appearance : 5 |	0000
0	appearance : pours thick black and very opaque . minimal head collects around the edges of the glass and a slight wisp forms on top . no carbonation evident . the wisp remains the whole way down , but essentially no lacing . pretty average for the style .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : light golden straw macro brew staple with tons of carbonation that dies out instantly and almost no lacing .	000000000000000000000
0	a : pours pasty red , syrupy , cloudy , and with chunks . this is not bottle conditioned as far as i know . not a great start .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : hazy amber , with a tan head with bright yellow tones . never seen anything like it .	00000000000000000000
0	a : a nice porter black , however the head was very disappointing , only about 2-3 mm of head , with a decently rough pour . non-existant lacing was surprising .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : hazy copper/amber . lasting off-white head and lacing .	00000000000
1	appearance : has a pretty , slightly hazy , amber-orange color . medium head with good lacing .	000000000000000000
0	appearance : it pours a very clear , light yellow color . head was foamy white and about a finger deep . head disappeared nearly as rapidly as it formed and left virtually no lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : nice gold look , white head , looks really good	000000000000
0	appearance : golden amber , slightly cloudy , very lively . half finger head dissipates quickly and leaves a thin off white film that last till the end ; little lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : straw - yellow , cloudy . no head , pours flat .	00000000000000

1	appearance : this beer was a mix of dark amber and deep crimson . a very intriguing color to say the least . to top it all off , the head was lightly pink and rose up to about a finger before it quickly settled back down into the beer . there were some nice sheets of lace left on the side of the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a pale straw-gold color ; very clear . frothy white head soon becomes a thin film , and leaves minimal lacing . i had to do a double-take at the bottle -- this does n't look like a witbier whatsoever , but more like a generic pilsner .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : this beer poured a nice 1.5 ' thick creamy looking head atop a dark mahogany beer . the head did not last long though and quickly dissipated to a thin bubbly top .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : okay , this does not look like a true beer . the huge foamy head is fun though , and so is the blueberry color ! lambics look similar . the	000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a murky reddish purple with a white head	00000000000
0	a : dark but not black - can see through it up to the light - pour was unimpressive - really no head to speak of from a bottle - no lace - nothing - looks like coke in a glass	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : very interesting . the initial pour yields a creme colored swirl throughout the entire glass . it slowly becomes a clear golden amber , starting at the bottom of the glass and creeping up towards the head . the 3/4 '' head is slightly off-white , and sticks around for a long time . at the end of the glass , there 's still 1/2 '' of it . lots of dotted sticky lacing and a few fat curtains are left behind .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : head was creamy and white , color was clear yellow	000000000000
1	appearance : free pour yields a one and a half inch , frothy , light tan head that dissipates slowly and rockily , leaving small , tight arches of lacing . pours black with brown highlights , and speckles the glass with spots and large islands of lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a dark black body with ruby highlights and a couple of fingers of tan head . retention is poor and it quickly recedes to a quarter-inch film on top . no lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : orange-gold with a mostly clear , with some opaqueness look . good amount of carbonation which helps with the continual lacing that glazes the top of the beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours nearly straight black with some small brown hues that creep through when back lit . 2 1/2 fingers of mocha head that hangs out for quite a bit . nice clumps of lacing on the side at first .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : black colour and great 2 cm head that lasts . 5	0000000000000
1	a : perfect , in every single way . the body is an incredible , shining burnt-orange ; ive seen stained glass less vibrant than this . adorning the top of this body is an off-white head , super-bubbly with silky cream beneath . lacing runs webs of foam over ever part of my glass . just superb .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : almost no carbonation no head and no pop when i opened the bottle black as night	000000000000000000

0	a : pours a nice , cloudy , orange colour , but after the initial head is nice , it quickly dissipates to a no head brew , no lacing at all , a bit disappointing , but not terrible .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : with 2 oz . reserved , pored a clear copper color with light beige head that dissipated rapidly . minimal lacing . light to minimal carbonation . pouring the remaining 2 oz . resulted in the usual yeasty couldyness with yummy chunklets of liquid bread .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : opaque black body with a small brown head that quickly dissipates leaving no lacing , and only a ring of cover . much darker than typical for the style , and the head is sub-par as well .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a nice looking dark brown with amber edges . almost no head and no lacing .	0000000000000000000

1	a : the cap pops with quite the hiss , and a very cautious pour results in two inches of aggressive , super-fine tan froth atop a black body with clear brown highlights . great retention , plenty of lace . seems a bit overcarbonated , but it looks terrific .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a transparent red-orange , with a big head that looks like egg whites that have been beaten until they form stiff peaks - how is it so dense ? nice lacing as you get down the glass . a beautiful beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : this beer poured a pale , golden yellow color . the white head rose up to a good three fingers and , surprisingly , lingered for a long time . probably all-malt , eh ? after it finally setted , a few thick patches of foam remained , which were being fed by some heavy streams of bubbles from the bottom of the glass . the head was sticky and a light web of lace was left behind on the side of the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : amazing . near black with deep mahogoany highlights . the foam builds from the bottom like an upside down snowstorm . there is a thick , soft tan head that just sits on top of this beer the entire time leaving foam in the bottom of the glass at the end . this may be my new benchmark for a `` 5 '' appearance	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours out a crystal clear ( for a hefeweizen ) golden straw . there is initally a gigantic head but it fades into nothing more than a skinny cap , which i am thinking is a result of the abv on this beer . as it stands now this beer does not really look like a hefeweizen .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : jet black . no light getting in at off . cream colored head with a good amount of lacing .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : i poured the duvel into the duvel glass and had a perfect pour , with the division between the foam and beer at around the middle of the duvel symbol and the foam reaching the very top of the glass . this ment about four fingers of super fluffy white head that left the most incredible lacing . the color of the beer was a pale golden straw .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured a honey gold with a finger-thick head , and very nice lacing . ample carbonation , but the head receded rather quickly . fairly clear and clean , but attractive nonetheless .	00000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : black color . half a finger of fizzy tan head that falls quickly and leaves no lacing . i know how coffee can wreak havoc on head retention , so i went easy on them . 3.5	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : just a hair redder than gold ( i.e. , not really amber in any real sense ) . it has a rocky three-finger head that fades to a thin layer leaving impressive lacing . the amber term is i believe a marketing rhyme ( yarpivo yantarnoe ) .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very , very pale straw color with a small , think white head that dissipates quickly and leaves no sign of lace .	0000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a cloudy brown color with a 1.5 '' head that has great retention . craterous head with plenty of lace . it coats the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : as with most sierra bottles , this bomber was gorgeous , with a pretty green wax covering the cap . it was a bit tougher than some waxed caps to open , although i have n't seen sierra do this before , so maybe they 're just learning . once it was open the estate poured an opaque golden orange with a big , thick , two finger head in a large snifter . the lacing was outstanding , covering about 80 % of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : golden , transparent body , white immediately disappearing head , aggressive head .	000000000000000
1	a : pours out a stunning neon-crimson orange/golden amber brown that is just so ever pleasing to look at and take in . a marvelously thick and large frothy head forms and winds its way down slowly into a very pleasant downy sheen across the top of the brew . magnifico ! n : light tones of sweet malty syrup , tiramisu ( i 'm not being cute ) , brandy , very slight alcohol . nice and quite different from what you get from a deutsch version . p/m : good and firm carbonation welcomes you in to an immediate wash of chalky malt that gives this the tone of a cousin to einbecker ur-bock . the rolling carbonation obscures some of the initial other flavors , but rising upards and outwards are sweet malt , whipped cream , grand marnier , and even a bit of molassas ( thatseems to be the theme here tonight , folks ) . the mid-palate does this wild sort of horizontal even-out that sort of gives the brew a centred flat line that slices right through the flavors and textures . visually it 's a straight line cutting through a cloud . finish is bocky malty and clean , but leaves a nice remembrance upon your palate and in your mouth . if it were n't for the aggressive carbonation , this would be absolutely breathtaking and not merely fantastic .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : not the most impressive looking of beers- dark black yes , however little head and rather flat looking . that was the only downside i could find .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : quite the site to behold , with a cloudy peach nectar color and a full head that sticks and sheets	0000000000000000000000
0	appearance : yellow color , transparent , white head : initially the head was almost non-existent ( maybe i didnt pour right ? ) but when i re-filled my glass from higher up there was a half-inch thickness .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : this bottle pours out a deep ruby hue with soapy looking head . retention is poor , granted , but i can tell there is still some carbonation left due to slight lacing . not the best looking beer , but being 7 years old now i guess i 'm not surprised .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : this beer really is n't much to look at , a clear light yellow with a bit of a white head . just looking at it , it could be a bud light for all i know .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : `` fizzy yellow beer '' , that poured with a fairly large fluffy white head initially , but it disappeared without a trace , almost immediately . if i hold my beer up to the tv , i can still watch the game . can almost make out the down-and-distance , too .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : the beer pours rusty in color with a pitiful white film for a head . there 's some steady carbonation but it is n't doing anything for the beer 's looks .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : deep yellow . the head virtually imploded ( i blinked and it was gone ) ; nothing remained after two minutes ( i am using the proper glassware , of course ) and there was no evidence at all of lacing . very unimpressive .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : the beer is nearly black , with very little , if any , light shining through . the head is a nice 2 fingers and tan . the lacing is soo good , and stays all the way down till the end ...	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : beautiful deep amber pour , huge dense creamy pale tan head that settles very slowly with super thick and heavy retention and a strong , foamy lace down the entire glass . a great looking beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured from a bomber into a standard pint glass . this beer is looks like most other big ( d ) ipas . the body is cloudy amber-red and the head has a a brown tinge and excellent lacing . the head is darker than the shiny `` egg white '' foam that forms on more filtered ipas .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a cloudy , dark honey color with a big , two finger head . head is very fluffy , leaving behind thick , unpatterened lacing as it disappears . hazy clouds of yeast linger at the bottom of the glass , as this is an unfiltered beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : when poured from a 22 oz bottle into a perfect pint glass there was a 2 1/2 finger light brown head that was above the very brown/black beer that lives up to its name .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a dark black color with two fingers of creamy mocha-colored head that slowly settles into a half finger . excellent lacing . 5/5	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : rich , dark copper body . cream-white head -- a fingers width -- that slowly ebbs to a shallow , cappucino pillow . lazy spider-web lacing . pretty .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : all of the carbonation must have been used up when i opened the can as , within just a few minutes , the beer was pouring like apple juice	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very light gold in color with mild haziness not the typical extreme cloudiness of the style . head pours a big bubbly white head not the dense , white , moussy head . head retention not as good as it could be , but does form a fair amount of islands . ( 3.0 )	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : red ... looks like a lambic . how did they get the red coloring ? maybe red food dye ? nice head retention .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear dark brown body , completely still . mediocre .	000000000000
0	a : very cloudy dark reddish-brown . not much head , but a ring is consistent . i would like a lighter color , like golden . where 's the head ? !	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : opaque , black beer - not much head except for tan colored ring around glass	00000000000000000
0	a : pale , like a cave fish species that has n't seen the sun in 3 million generations	0000000000000000000
1	a : dark amber , good 2 finger head , plenty of carbo	0000000000000
1	a : enthralling look : a sultry , mildly hazed amber-auburn capped with a lofty crown - almost 3-fingers of spongy ivory . a few fine lines of wriggling carbonation . terrific lace , long drapes of seafoam spackling atop a solid 1/2 finger of perma-foam . it 's a fine looking beer , top to bottom .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a very clear , light golden color with a thin , white head . thin lacing with visible carbonation .	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : damn gorgeous ! just like a nitro-tap , it pours creamy , luscious and smooth . take your time admiring the head form up and become a thick two-finger crown that lasts and lasts . i bet if i left and came back after a few hours , that massive head would still be there ! and the lacing , oh my . it 's like the great wall of china . color is an incredibly deep black , if you can get past the outrageous head .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this beer pours a deep dark brown with a major ruby red edge to it . with the first pour there was a ridiculous four finger of rocky , light brown head to it . amazing head retention , thick , sticky , chunky lacing left on the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : served with a finger and a half of light brown creamy head . retention is excellent . the lacing from the head alone is impeccable . lacing continues to impress showing the utmost stickiness throughout the entire beer . the body of the beer is middle-of-your-eye black and opaque as expected .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours very clear slightly orangish gold with a huge cap of white foam that was 3 '' at first and grew after the pour . it took a couple of minutes before it even started to fade a little .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : amazing bubbly head , orangish hue . major league frothy .	0000000000000
1	a : pours out a brilliantly bright blood red color with a foamy light beige head . moderate lacing on the glass with a very mild head retention and is crystal clear . the bright reddish hue of the beer is really rather stunning .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pale golden color - poured a white head that disappeared quickly . frankly , it did n't look like much .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : a careful pour produced a crystal clear honey colored brew with a bit of an orange hue . fantastic frothy white foam head at least a 1/2 '' thick that reduces to a tight lumpy foam that hangs in there for the whole glass . i ca n't imagine a more picture perfect look for a triple !	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : big huge mammoth foam head , going away at a leisurely pace , even with a `` beer pour '' , i 'd say outstanding in my book . it looks like fresh beer with pillowy churn across the top . hazy and dimly orange , more yellow , and no particulate at the bottom .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : as far as clarity goes it is just fine , slight chill haze that dissipates , with a weathered golden hue . sticky thin lace is all a hard pour yields .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a deep black ale which is nearly opaque , but maduro brown when light penetrates . single finger , peanut head falls to a thick quilt of the same . decent lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : hazy reddish brown . lots of action on the pour , but this one pours like it is very viscous . carbonation activity persists through out the drinking of this one in the form of very small and slow moving bubbles .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : slight hazy orange-ish hue . medium-small sized head that leaves a few traces of lacing on the glass .	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : blackish-brown with a tan head . the head left some lacing up top and then seemed to wholly stick to the side of the glass the rest of the way down .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a nice light orangish/red color with a nice large tan foam head . there is a decent amount of lacing .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours really really black , totally opaque . half a finger worth of a straight brown head . half creamy looking . retention is ok and lacing is bad .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a cloudy copper with a rock-hard head ( due to wheat ) . unfiltered or not , wheat or not , the cloudiness is a bit odd , although well advertised on the bottle .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : darker golden , but clear ( not cloudy ... hmmm ) . no head retention . yeeeah , not off to a good start .	000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : black in color with a fluffy 3 '' + head that lasts forever . nice lace covers the glass .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : into a pint glass , this pours a clear amber color under a thin but nicely sustained head .	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a slightly golden yellow with orange hues . a 2 '' ivory colored head that shows excellent retention . craterous surface and gobs of foamy lace make for a perfect visual .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear grapefruit-colored body with light carbonation , underneath a one-finger head of white foam . the head disappears pretty quickly , and leaves only a light amount of lace . this one definitely suffers by comparison to the beatifully unfiltered alesmith , but it certainly would n't be getting a much higher score on its own . pretty boring .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : well it hits the glass and i am a bit thrown off . this has the thinness and color of a pretty typical macro . really generic golden yellow that is crystal clear . the head was a good finger of bubbly white foam , but it fell to a decent ring with an amoeba-like cap . it does n't throw up any lace due to lack of stick . carbonation is incredibly active , with a fountain like appearance of constant streams of quick moving bubbles . sadly this is the only thing that stands out about the look . this straight up looks like a lager .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : black , nearly 100 % opaque , with a large fluffy brown head and nice lacings . flavor : first hit with a bit of citrus fruit followed by some spices , maybe a hint of nutmeg , and that earthy dark chocolate bitterness . but in the end it is a predominate metallic aftertaste .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured into a glass : dark brown/black color . not totally opaque against the light . the bottle has been chilled continuously since inception , i imagine : i got it out of the cooler at k & l and left it in my fridge . a young beer like this means the bottle conditioning has n't had time to work . there is a slow dissolution of bubbles when the beer is poured , but it never forms a head , collar , or lace . sorry alan : i understand what 's going on but i ca n't just give you a pass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a very hazy amber , exhibiting significant chill haze . a half-inch head forms on the pour , falling to a film over the beer . no lacing at all .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : fluffy white head that does not quickly dissipate . deep copper color .	000000000000000
0	a : a clear pale orange until the yeast residual at the bottom of the bottle is swirled and added . small , off-white head the recedes quickly . very little lacing ( much less head and lacing than expected ) .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy neon yellow hues with a nice white creamy looking head . this is a very strange color . not what i was expecting .	000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : looks nice . bright ruby , perfect clarity . nice head , nice lacing .	00000000000000000
1	appearance : pour a clear pale golden color with a rich marshmallow of a head that leaves plenty of lace , but dissipates rather quickly	0000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : cloudy , dull orange that turns fiery in the light . massive foamy head with loads of lacing .	000000000000000000000
1	a : poured a clear garnet color with pillowy head that reduces to lacing , nice	0000000000000000
0	a : pours a pink orange with a very mild head , almost flat looking .	0000000000000000
0	appearance : light golden color ( looks like a pilsner not like an oktoberfest ) . nice lacing left on the glass .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy orange in color . there 's tons of floaties/sediment in this beer . nice 1.5 finger fluffy white head that has excellent retention and lacy .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours thick and black as midnight on a moonless night . beautiful 2 inch extremely dark tan head forms and slowly recedes . wow !	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : great . bronze with a big , lasting golden top .	0000000000000
0	a : a light amber color that first appeared to have great lacing and head , but unfortunately dissipated within a minute or two .	0000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured to give a beautiful golden ( light amber ) beer with a rich , thick white foam head that had good longevity . the beer was slightly hazy ( chill haze ? ) .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a murky brown/amber color . a tiny white cap of foam forms . some light sticky lace is left behind .	000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : tonight i am going to be using one of my favorite glasses in the cabinet , my dogfish head goblet which is perfect just about every occasion . i pulled the large champagne bottle out of the fridge and proceeded to unwrap the wire cage and wrangle the cork out . thankfully i did n't need to get my pliers to finish the job and the cork slipped out fairly easily and heard a generous pop while the carbonation gasses floated out . i decided to tilt my glass fairly hard to make sure there was n't a overflow of head and it poured beautifully . when i was done i was left with absolutely no head at all , it looks as still as wine with no carbonation bubbles . as i hold my glass up to the light it appears to be deep red almost ruby with some purple tones thrown in . a fair amount of haziness and there is no light passing through the murky ale . as i give a quick swirl the viscosity appears to be pretty light and only leaving slight legs that go away quickly .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : clear , dark maroon , steady flow of carbonation from the depths . big head at first , fades and leaves a little lace , a little off-white head .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours black with a light fizzy off-white head , some lace .	00000000000000
1	a : the pour is a dark amber-red color with an off-white/khaki head .	00000000000000

0	a : pours a very murky maroon body that glows with a faint reddish tint when held to the light . head is beige in color . retention is moderate ; it leaves a collar on the beer and some scattered foam on top . i must say , if it were n't for the head , it would look like pond water .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a deep goldenish orange , leaves a 2 finger eggshell colored head that takes forever to settle into a 1/2 '' cap and leaves lacing everywhere . it refuses to let go of the sides of my glass . one of the absolute best ipa 's i 've seen . flawless .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : opens with a loud pop , clear pale gold in color with huge white head as a billion tiny bubbles rush to get to the surface . the head recedes leaving lace sticking to the sides of the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pale golden body with a light milky haze that seems to shimmer in the light thanks to the myriad of fast rising streamers . monster belgian style achouffe head rises quickly and drops down to a rocky crevice infested mass that leaves massive cloud like chunks hanging off the side of my glass and expanded foam icebergs ready to sink passing ships . awesome looks ! ! i toyed with a 4.5 but i loved this one so much i went for a 5.0 - hands down the best part of this brew .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : golden amber with 1/2 finger of white head . it has nice lacing , but it 's a pretty standard look for an ipa .	000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : oh boy ... is this the belgian version of b to the e but for women ? i am nervous & somehow i have a feeling it is warranted . from the tall slender can , this beer pours a pinkish/purplish color , like the inside of plum that isnt quite ripe . there is an effervescent one finger pinkish colored head atop . it leaves spotty lacing on the inside of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours goldenrod with a light white head , some lacing .	0000000000000
0	a : hazy opaque , and very full orange/yellow honey color . wild head that fizzes like crazy , then immediately dissipates leaving the beer looking flat and lifeless in the glass . ( retains a slight ring around the edge and leaves a limp lace that quickly slides back down into the beer )	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : the beer is a nice amber that pours with a decent amount of head . a disturbing trend i 've noticed with rogue beers is that the head disappears almost immediately and leaves zero lacing . this beer continues that disappointing trend .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark and hazy orange/brown color . a large beige head forms with great sticky lacing .	00000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours jet black , with an incredibly thick and frothy brown head . the head subsides slowly . no light is coming through this one at all . tons of lacing . beautiful looking beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : beer is a very cloudy deep copper/orange color . very little off-white head , maybe a finger at most all froth . carbonation is evident .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a golden-orange color with a light airy head that turns to a film very fast . there 's a ton of floaters in the beer ... presumably yeast debris . excessive .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : golden color , white head . not much deeper than that .	00000000000000

0	a : deep dark red brown . murky , and the small head fizzles away quickly and leaves no lacing . not the prettiest looking beer , i 'll be honest .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : beautiful hazy amber with a one finger creamy head that had excellent retention and lacing .	000000000000000000

1	a : pours a dark red almost black looking , with a full white head , great retention and good lacing . seen this beer out of the olde wooden cask too , looks phenomenal .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : this beer was a royal pain in the ass to pour , even having seen the previous posts about out-of-control head . i poured about an inch in the glass and ended up with foam to the top . ridiculuously over-carbed . there is a lot of sediment in this beer leading to murkiness .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : it is a hazy straw color , with a heavy , white colored five finger head which was poured into a weiss glass that heaps like a mountain on top of the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : looks exactly like a good pee . not too dark or light . just a perfect pee colour . i mean you could feed this through a tube and use it to make special effects pee in a movie . very little carbonation that fades instantly .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : rich amber colour with a nice-sized head .	0000000000
0	a : the pour is a very muddled brown color with plenty of red highlights and a short lived off-white head on top . not particularly attractive in any sense .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : black glass shows some ruby edges , no head retention at all leaves it looking a bit flat .	000000000000000000000
1	a : clear golden yellow with a gorgeous , billowing head good retention . tons of carbonation , with trails of whirling bubbles . very pretty !	000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : fresh off a new keg . no head formation , which is odd for a wheat beer . on top of that , i could seriously pitch this beer into some wort and it would ferment . there was so much yeast in my beer that it looked like someone shook up a yeast vial and dumped it in .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : light rusty brown in colour with minimal head retention .	000000000000
0	a : opaque black with a rich brown , cappuccino hued head . dense , but not bustling . good retention . not exactly an american brown looking ale , more like a rich stout . good looking brew , but not looking like a brown .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a bright golden amber with a fairly dense half inch off-white head . head retention and lacing are extremely good . this is what an ipa should look like - exceptional .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours clear yellow , with a gorgeous 1 1/2 - 2 finger head . copious lacing throughout.this is what i think of when i think of the the perfect looking beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : beautiful bright beer , ultra-dark burnt orange with absolutely no carbonation or head .	0000000000000000

1	a : the beer is a bright ruby red color with a large tan head that fades very slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a fizzy champagne-esque head , pink in colour , real thin , with no cream , and bad retention . must be extremely carbonated because the abv is low . the retention is ( at best ) 5 seconds . colour is a nontransparent watermelon . sm : souring hops , bacteria , some funk , crystal malts , raspberries , and cherries . complex , balanced , and incredibly inviting . a moderate strength aroma .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : sparkling dark golden color . slightly off white , almost cream colored , head that rises large at first as the beer is poured , but it soon settles to a thin collar and does not last long . carbonation is high when initially poured from the bottle , but it soon rescinds and just leaves a few slow streamers .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : a whitish golden yellow body , the carbonation is present but hard to gauge . the body was also pretty opaque . a fluffy white head without much retention , almost akin to dropping an orange slice into the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours pitch black with medium tan head .	0000000000
0	appearance : kind of ugly . just a pale straw yellow with a one-finger head that quickly dissipates . literally no lacing left on the glass as i drank .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : dark orangish yellow , good head that recedes too quickly but has good white lacing .	000000000000000000
0	a : clear and dark tree sap brown with a fizzy head that fades into a thin bubbly ring on the side of the glass . would have like to see a head that could sustain itself but really nothing is going on here .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a nice cloudy golden yellow color with 1 inch frothy white head . decent retention .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : straw color , reasonably cloudy . despite the 60 % wheat malt content it had low head retention ( even with a dirty glass , it should have held up better ) . the bartender served this with a lemon wedge stuck on the glass ... that 's their practice , i guess ... i removed it as soon as he put the beer down in front of me . flavor : bananas and ... mustard ? ! ? that was my initial sense , really ( and i was n't even eating anything , let alone mustardy ) . bananas and mustard slathered on fresh , peasant bread and sprinkled with some lemon juice . has a tart , dry finish .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : cloudy caramel and light brown . the frothy head is 3 fingers tall and beige in color . there 's a hearty finger of retention for most of the session and a ton of lacing . i love it .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : cloudy appearance , golden with a touch of red . almost like an amber unfiltered wheat .	0000000000000000000
0	a : this beer is surprisingly sexy . i was expecting pale straw , but received copper . lacing is lively and active , but the head could use a bit of retention . sexy nonetheless .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : light and transparent , slight gold hue . clear as day .	00000000000000
0	appearance : brown coloured and very cloudy . creamy head , which disappears after five minutes leaving a thin , lumpy layer . not very impressive	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a one finger head of no cream , pretty thin , and of bad retention . colour is a clear cloudy yellow . appealing . sm : clove , light lemon , and very light yeast . very light in strength but appealing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a dark amber , almost copper color with no head and modestly active carbonation .	000000000000000000
1	appearance : this brew pours with a thick foamy butter color . lacings are plentiful . head retention is looong . brew color is a pleasant amber . excellent first impression .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : looks very much like a pint of snpa -- the familiar deep gold color tinged with orange , perfectly clear , and topped with an off-white head that shrinks down to a ring around the glass . the head forms very attractive lacing when you tilt the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured a dark caramel color with almost no head and zero lacing .	000000000000000
0	a : slightly hazy light amber color . disappointing head .	00000000000
0	a : not seeing anything special after the pour ; straw-like color with a quickly dissipating head and lots of bubbles . looks like i poured a high life..	00000000000000000000000000000

1	a : poured rich dark , with a tan head that sat about 2 fingers thick and had a small amount of retention with fantastic lacing ... perfect look for a stout	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : dark red color with 1 finger of tan head that fades to a thin cap with some chunky lacing .	0000000000000000000000

0	appearance : murky medium-brown . thin beige head that dissipated quickly .	000000000000
1	appearance : pours a crystal clear amber with a nice half-finger off-white head . it hangs on for quite a while as a result of the large amount of cascading bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass . lacing is tremendous and comes in sheets .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours with a large but very very thin head , head retention is of course poor and turns into the whispiest of lacing , if a lacing at all . pours the clearest of yellows you can use your glass as a magnifying glass with this one , not as bubbly as one would expect considering how carbonated it is . it looks clean , clear and crisp , almost completely sterile , which for some would be attractive knowing their beer was clean , however in a romantic sense this beer is devoid of all beauty and romance that a proper craft beer has . lets be serious though this is 50 cents a can or so in a 30 rack . still much better looking than some of the more expensive macros .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : not cloudy enough . golden color . white head that dissipates fast . to style except the cloudiness	00000000000000000000
0	a : standard pour yields no head and no resulting lace . beer is a dark , almost opaque black with an attractive reddish tint which barely saves it from being a `` 1 '' .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the look of this beer just screams delicious . the overall cloudy very light gold almost yellow complexion was very indicative of a normal hef also the head was average starting out fairly strong about a finger and a half tall and not real thick .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a golden haze . very little head that disappears quickly . bubbles like champagne .	000000000000000000
1	a : deep , dark amber with no visible carbonation but a solid 1.5 finger , tan head that does n't stick around for very long . lacing appears normal .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured a nice head that dissipated quickly , but the murkiness of this beer had almost a black quality to it , and the color was not appealing . sort of a pink/brown/black that i ca n't describe but not what i expected to see .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours into a sam adams glass a brownish amber with some orange hues to it . the head starts at 1-2 fingers and drops eventually to a massive collar and a hazy and full surface of foam . rings of lacing mark the sizes of my swallows all the way down the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : golden , hazy , with quite a lot of settings since this beer is unfiltered .	000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear straw yellow with a nice white head that fades to a layering and leaves a nice amount of lacing on the glass . looks pretty great .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : color of weak iced tea on the pour . good head with fair retention ( dissipates quickly ) and little to no lacing on my beer stein . a lot flaky/chunky from the final bottle carbonation .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : as served the beer is slightly hazy apricot color with a `` creamy fine bubbled off-white head that leaves foam on the sides as it recedes to about `` and then remains at that thickness for a while , fed by the steady streams of effervescent carbonation . sipping leaves interesting patterns of lacing that are a combination of small patches , speckles and leggy trails . even during the last 1/3 of the beer there is a 1/8 '' head that leaves a sheet of foam and lacing when sipping .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a weak head and a watery copper body .	000000000000
1	a : massive erupting head in my tumbler ; a very nice whipped topping . things began to slowly melt away leaving pockets and patches of lace . the head itself even took on some crater formations . the body is a soft hazy golden tow-color	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a hazy golden-straw color with a ginormous head ! probably a good 4:1 ratio of head to beer ! and man did the head stay around forever ! left lacing everywhere once it decided to go down a bit .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours like overused motor oil . dark as looking at a moonless night with a blindfold on . slim cappuccino colored head , slow building , fast leaving . i was promised a voluminous head , maybe it was just this sample , i 'll be sure to amend in the future if necessary .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : dark brown and relatively transparent pour for the style . produces a one finger , medium looking , off-white or light tan head with poorer retention . lots of noise on this head too . dark brown body and , again , quite transparent , with medium carbonation evident . head quickly fades to a faint wisp and ring . only a ring remains until the end but leaves no lacing down the glass . too light , transparent , and the head is lacking as well .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours into my victory willibecker a crystal clear , bronze golden color . a massive , frothy , 4-finger high , bone white head forms on top and takes its good old time falling . it does n't even get all the way there , settling out at a rocky , 1-finger cap with curtains of lacing showing how high the head had been . picture perfect .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : what a lovely opening - i just had to loosen the cork slightly , and then watch as it ever-so-slowly inched its out , on its way to the ceiling . i had the tulip ready to catch the slight overflow , and proceeded to fill it perfectly to the brim with bright orange beer and fine off-white foam . the voluminous head recedes incrementally , leaving patches of soapy lace all around . beautiful gueuze .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : 2.5 . a light , pilsner like looking golden color . not a strong first impression in it 's debut for me . transparent , no sediment . however , it appears to have strong lacing characteristics , appearing to be pacing it 's way down the glass like patrick ewing pacing down the court in his elder days . extreme copper appearance , not very proper .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : when poured into a bell 's brewery pint glass , this doppelbock is a murky mahagony brown with ruby red highlights all through out the beer 's body . it had a poor head of foam that consisted of only 5 tan colored bubbles . these 5 tan bubbles quickly dissipated into nothing . no rings , no lace , nothing whatsoever . i tried to get the head of foam to come out by swirling it around , but it was a waste of time . it did nothing to aid the appearance .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : i 'm always torn to give a beer a bad rating in appearance . the qualities i usually look for are a nice color ( which i suppose is pretty damn hard to screw up ) , head , and lacing . this beer does n't fit in with the color of a usual ipa/iipa , but i do n't think that 's a reason to mark it down points . they are going for a specific blend of malts and hops here , and i think the experimentation ( i do recognize they are n't the first to do a bipa ) should be encouraged . this beer is black . no doubt about it . a very dark color , with no light making its way through the glass . a nice finger of creamy and bubbly head at the top , with some lacing going from head to toe .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : crystal clear gold color with no carbonation to be seen . no head , no nothing except liquid to look at . at least it does n't have things floating in it .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a brightly coloured yellow w/ no real head to speak of and no lacing . a little disappointing in the lack of head	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : decent lacing a very cloudy amber/copper color with lots of sediment floating around .	0000000000000000
1	appearance : light brown with amber highlights . it 's got a nice amount of head with good retention .	00000000000000000000
1	a : jet black with a good looking two finger tan head . a soft pillow of foam hangs with good retention forming a blanket over the beer . it left behind a bunch of sticky lacing as well for good measure .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : capped opens with a hiss and the beer immediately starts foaming . standard pour yields a giant frothy , coarse , 4.5 finger white head that sticks around . beer is a clear bright orange . lacing is stick and stringy with great retention . outstanding looking beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark smooth appearance with a small amount of head that dissapates quickly in the glass . no lacing to speak of .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours , as you might expect , a pitch black with a small ring of translucence . it 's oily looking , with a small mocha head that vanishes quickly into a bead around the rim .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : clear , light yellow , say 2 srm . has some lite looking carbonation . perhaps its the style but the color is a bit ugly .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : uncapped , causing a foamy eruption . was i too warm or did jp overcarbonate ? bam pours straw gold , birthing a generous four-finger head . the cap eventually collapses to a rocky bubble bath , which sticks around and leaves belgian lace on the glass . there is a slight haze , and the final pours are cloudy from disturbing the yeast cake . even in the first pour , though , tiny flecks of yeast float in suspension .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a one finger head of fair cream and thickness , but bad retention ( especially for the merely average abv ) . colour is a semitransparent gold . sm : cream , bittering hops , and barley . this is no ordinary pilsner . a mild strength aroma , but a subtle one .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : lucid rusty dark brown body with a clear uniform white head cap which lays a smooth coating on the glass walls . 360 & # 730 ; belgian style lacing coats the entire circumference of the head as it sinks into the goblet . longevity of the white crown is very good and decent enough overall looks .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured into a very nice wheat beer glass , it has a pale yellow head that quickly fades away . the body is clear and pure gold . lookswise , it 's not very special .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the beer is hazy pale yellow in color and has a light to moderate amount of visible carbonation . it poured with a finger high bright white head that died down but consistently left a thin layer of bubbles covering the surface .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : reddish looking beer that looks like a fruit cocktail . short 1/4 '' head falls quickly . no lacing develops .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : fuzzy gold color with ample carbonation . nice medium puffy head that held on .	00000000000000000
0	a : decanting this into my 22oz goblet yields a black beer with ruddy brown highlights and a thin , dark brown head that recedes to a ring rather quickly . there is n't much visible carbonation either .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pitch , motor oil black on the pour , sludgy and thick . really no head whatsoever , even with being quite vigorous , a small ring of brown bubbles tried to cling around the glass . i would have appreciated more of a head on this one , but i guess for 11.5 % it is n't too bad . easily improvable but alas ...	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours an oily black with a very substantial 1-2 finger head that is milk-chocolate in color . lacing is pervasive and amazing . head retention is very good and minimal agitation conjures up the substantial froth anew .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured from a 22oz . waxed bottle into a tulip glass . deep , opaque and gorgeous copper color with a fluffy white , quarter inch head .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : this beer was served a clear light caramel color with yellowish edges and absolutely no head . the head issue could be due to the fact that this beer was served ( without asking me when i ordered ) with a quarter of an orange hooked onto the edge of my glass . what kind of craft brewery still serves fruit in their wheat beers ? or at the very least , what kind of brewery doesnt ask first ? maybe it was my fault . im not sure if i should rate this a 1.0 on appearance since i had an orchard dipped in my beer , or just ignore it . after all , the color is nice enough .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : light golden red / honey colored ; cloudy with small yeast chunks . now somethings are good with chunks in them ... chunks in my beverages - now that does n't do it for me .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark black color , good sized tan head . good lacing down the glass	000000000000000000
0	a : pours black with two fingers of tan head that recedes into a thin ring with no lacing .	00000000000000000000
0	a : pours goldenrod with a mild bubbly white head , fair retention , nothing special to look at .	00000000000000000000
0	a : pale yellow , looks almost like a light juice . no head , hmm . might be the most pathetic looking beer i have ever seen .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a pitch brown body , possibly black , with two fingers of light mocha head filling the remainder of the glass . the receding head is composed of dense , creamy-looking bubbles . the head leaves tons of sticky lace down the sides of the tulip , in all 3 pours .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear copper color with a foamy head that disappears quickly to a slim collar around the glass .	00000000000000000000
1	a : black/brownish color , fairly transparent for a stout . did have an awesome 1 finger head and some gorgeous lacing .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : one finger head is devoid of cream , is quite thin , and retains badly . yeast particles sit at the bottom . colour is a hazy orange-copper . unappealing . sm : heavy yeast and dark fermented orange peel . interesting . a moderate strength aroma .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : gorgeous dark ruby color with orange hues and a light tan head .	000000000000000
0	appearance : dark tan head . a little lighter in color than some other porters , but still a nice dark brown .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : wonderful copper color . lighter then a lot of ipas but not much .	0000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a cloudy ( some of the particles seem suspended in time ) copper orange with a finger of sticky cream colored head . the bubbles look almost wispy and the head does n't seem to want to go away . when it finally does start to go away , there is a great ring left around the top of the beer and there is actual lacing and i have n't even had a sip yet . perfect !	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : as the cap is pried loose , there is only a very faint sound of gas escaping . it pours a nicely hazy golden-amber body with only a hint of bubbly , off-white head up top that fades instantly , leaving only a bare ring around the edge and sparse lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pale bright gold with a thin white head that leaves behind a few rings .	00000000000000000

0	a : red , and very hazy . like , much , much too hazy . thinnish head , less than one finger .	000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : it poured a beautiful three finger head that is somewhere between off-white and khaki colored . it is very sudsy with craters forming at the top of the cap . the beer has a burnt sienna body with orange highlights ; can look clear through the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured with two fingers of bubbly beige head , which left only little dots of lacing here and there . beer is a deep reddish orange in color .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a beautiful cloudy ruby pour with a small offwhite head . head fizzes out almost instantly and there appears to be no lacing .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : one finger tan head of poor retention ; little cream . black colour . looks overcarbonated . sm : coffee , alcohol , vanilla , chocolate . citrus notes are missing from the aroma .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : paradigmatic fizzy yellow beer . adequate white head . big bubbles . poor retention .	00000000000000000
1	a : rich , thick , foamy head of large bubbles . cream-coloured head sits above a dark copper beer . plenty of lacing -- very visually appealing !	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a crystal clear darkish straw yellow with a creamy and rocky half inch head held up by some lazy ropes of carbonation . this beer is only slightly lighter than the busch light i just sampled as a point of comparison .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a cloudy brownish gold color with a thick off-white colored head . could see sediment floating in the beer .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : pours with a light brown foamy cap of 1 1/2 fingers , falling at a moderate pace . the body is crimson tinted amber and sports the classic brilliant clarity so common in bbc 's beers . even with only average lacing , this beer is a looker .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : when poured into a pilsner glass , this anchor beer poured a beautiful deep dark mahagony brown with a few dark ruby red highlights . that was only the beginning . sitting on top of this beer was a fluffy 2 inch head of tan colored foam . not only was it big , but it had excellent retention that left behind a small tan film and streak after streak of tan lace . the appearance was eye candy to me .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark as dark could be . there was n't a speck of light coming through this thing . head was very minimal , just a thin dark haze at the top of the glass . left very fine lacing along the way .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a huge , white rocky head dominates the appearance . it does eventually dissipate to a ring over the beer and significant glass lacing , but it takes a while . the carbonation is very active ; watching the bubbles climb to the top of the yellow liquid is quite fun .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear straw yellow with a finger head that instantly dwindles to a half finger . nice lacing throughout .	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured extremely dark , almost black into a tulip glass with minimal to no head .	000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours with a massive 3 1/2 finger dense , white head . this settles very slowly and very little , still maintaining about 2 fingers several minutes after the pour . very nice lacing . the beer itself is a golden honey with a massive amount of activity ; a torrent rises from the nucleation site .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : gorgeous deep red body is pummeled on the pour by a highly excited flamingo pink that runs deep down into the body of the brew and quickly rises to form a thick luscious shrimp pink head . lots of clotted lacing that hangs around for the entire drink . looks inviting , but it is no surprise that this is the bets part of the st. louis framboise for me .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours murky light brown with a great large creamy beautiful tan head . dissipation is slow , oh so slow , and leaves great lacings .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a one finger medium tan head that has some retention . the head is foamy and creamy . the color of the beer is a dark brown color with rusty hues . the clarity of the beer is semi opaque with copper hues . there are some carbonation bubble visible .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours pitch black with a lot of carbonation from the bottom of the glass . the carbonation mysteriously disappears half way up . pours a relatively large , two-finger thick tan head , which is very persistent . eventually levels out into a thick lace and it remains the entire time . lots of thick lacing down the sides as you drink , and the head re-establishes itself after every drink . possibly the best looking thing on the planet .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : black with slight translucency around the edges . an aggressive pour yields a fairly small head , which quickly disappears .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : a medium orange pour with a brilliant clarity yields a quickly diminishing fizzy off white head . an initial strong show of macro-bubbles quickly gives way to a near silent offering . the glass remained clean , free of any lacing as it sat there in my pint glass without much inspiration .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pitch black . thin tan fizzy head , that disappeared almost immediatly .	000000000000000
0	appearance : poured into a pint glass from the bottle . a dark , clear red color with an finger of off white head that dissipated after a minute .	000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : light yellow color , not much head . no lacing or retention once the lime goes in .	00000000000000000000
0	a : a bit of a gusher . body is a murky brownish yellow . dirty white head gets up to one finger but does n't stay around for long .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : opaque black with a strong caramel head and lacing .	000000000000

1	a : poured hard into my portsmouth snifter , a reverse waterfall yields a milk chocolate brown cap on a text-book potting soil black body . although no real head ever formed , the thin surface layer cap and foam ring promise some carbonation . it seems the reports of the marshal 's demise do n't apply to this particular bottle . swirling the beer inside my glass literally stains the glass a walnut brown showing the viscosity of the brew . 5/5	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : deep amber . does not have much of a head - thin lacing .	0000000000000000
1	a : pours like molasses , midnight black in hue with a slow-rising , deep chocolate colored head . the head quickly falls and the liquid sits like oil in the glass . slow falling , vinous legs drip down the sides of the glass upon swirling . very attractive beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark mahogany , hazy and some sediment in the glass on each pour even though there were a few . the head was puffy like a marshmallow . adequate lacing but the one slap on this whole beer are the floaties . bottle graphics : 8/10 .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : beautiful ruby red with a perfect head ( into a trappistes rochefort chalice ) . simply stated - this is one great looking beer .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : decent head , no lacing . body is off in color and haze factor . as far as i 'm concerned , this is too yellow and clear for a wit .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours to a dark , translucent orange with a small off-white head .	000000000000000
0	appearance : looks very standard/unexciting , although darker than most ipa 's , with a deep clover-honey color , red overtones and some shiny yellow strikes . barely any head and what does show up dies right away , which is mighty surprising for an ipa . some negligible lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the beer pours just about black with a tan colored head on top .	0000000000000000

0	appearance : transparent yellow body , very slight orange tinge . very minimal head that dissipates immediately , leaving only slight traces of soapscum . not an auspicious start .	000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : light brown color , great rocky head	000000000
0	appearance : clear brown pour makes a small , medium , tan head that quickly vanishes . head fades to a ring and splotchy wisp almost immediately . black body with zero carbonation evident . a slight ring remains but leaves no lacing down the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : ruddy dark brown and opaque with a big creamy off white head . sort of ruddy and swampish . not a particularly attractive color . good retention and some scattered lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a pitch black color , small tan head with very slight lacing down the glass	000000000000000000
0	a : this beer should just be drank out of the bottle . the body is n't bad looking , clear and straw colored . the head however , looks disgusting . clumpy and overly foamy , but especially ... clumpy . after a pour into the glass , looks like badly made foam for a cappuccino . it starts to dissipate into slimy , spitty looking patches that made me want to stop drinking this beer . a bit like marshmallows melting in a hot cocoa .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : nearly clear golden color . this beer should be cloudy and i looked at other reviews to verify that it is not filtered . ( i had a filtered apwa before and it sucked , so now i 'm always weary when an apwa is clear . ) also , there was no head to speak of since the beer was poured right up to the top of the weizen glass . pretty much an awful , uneducated pour . i wish i did n't have to do this , but i have to review it like i see it . hopefully i 'll be able to try it again before leaving chicago so i can give it respectable marks . sorry goose island . 3.5	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : golden orange in color with 1.5 finger sticky white head . edit : poured this into an over-sized wine glass ( 11/23/08 ) . bright copper with thin white head . very sticky - great lacing ! steady , gentle , carbonation allows head to retain throughout session . looks very good .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : golden body , bordering on a medium copper , fluffy white head that brings a rather impressive amount of sticky lacing around the glass . slow dissipation and excellent retention - a really great looking iipa .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a clear , mildly hazy orange/copper color with reddish tints when held to the light . the head is a generous 2 fingers when poured , but it recedes into a light film on the top . it leaves significant lacing down the glass as i drink . for the abv , it 's exceptional .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : beautiful dark reddish brown brew with huge frothy head that crackles and pops till it settles down staying huge but becoming a soft rocky cap .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : moderate pour yields a 1 finger semi-fine white head with poor retention , evaporating quickly into a thin white film . beer itself is a semi-clear bright orange . lacing is spotty and sticks closely to the brew it came from .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear , and on the neon side of golden body with little to no head . it looks like a typical light beer only somehow more yellow .	000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : looks great at first : a vibrant amber with a skew toward ruby-redness . plenty of carbonation and a tall cap ( almost 2-fingers ) of mocha-beige fizz . good clarity , small streams of mini-carbonation , but the head dies far too quickly . gone in less than a minute , not even a hint of film left . no lace either . color and clarity are very nice but head retention is a big disappointment . too big to score above a '3 ' ...	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : not much head , what 's there disippates immediately . almost no lacing . fluid is a not-quite-opaque oily amber .	00000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a thin , transparent , brown pour yields a three finger , medium looking , fluffy , off-white head with great retention . sienna pr bistre brown in color with higher levels of carbonation . head slowly fades to a good , full cap and leaves sheets of lacing down the sides of the glass . great lacing , but too light and thin a body , and the head needs to be darker for the style .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : gorgeous presentation . pours a milky , ruby red color with a 1/4 inch light red head . mild lacing .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : standard pour yields a clear , pale yellow beer is no head and no lacing . nice legs though . a beer this style with no head and no lacing is below average .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear golden yellow . large white fluffy head . plenty of carbonation . not the best retention but the lacing is very good .	0000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : beautiful pure red body with huge off-white fluffy head . eternal lacing .	000000000000000
1	a : all of the times i 've had this on tap or bottled i never remember it looking this good . translucent golden amber , hazed but you can still see some carbonation . massive , dense stiff white head with amazing retention and thick streaky webs of lacing . ok , this was the best part of the beer this time around .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : mag-freaking-nificent . how do they do this ? the head is slowly forming into one finger 's worth of beige head right in front of me . cascading bubbles are turning the body of the beer brown to black from the bottom up . the body is essentially black with brown edges , and not much else . that 's one of the creamiest looking heads i 've ever seen . there 's a ton of retention , too . and i have to say : there 's not one thing i can say negatively about this beer 's appearance .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : gorgeous out of the nitro-can . apart from the initial explosion upon cracking the beer open , ( which always happens regardless of how long you let it sit still ) the beer pours entirely of head ... a thick , creamy head with the consistency of melted ice cream . starting slowly , the head dissapates in stunning fashion..as the carbonation creates a virtual explosion in the glass itself..and creates quite the visual effect .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear golden amber body . a massive 3 '' head nearly overflowed my tulip , even after a slow steady pour . the head hangs around for a little while , and eventually fades to a big fat blob in the center of the glass . lots of thick lacing coats the glass and stays for a while .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : popping the cap on this beer caused had no discernible effect , so i may have poured a mite overvigorously . i was met with a monumental head rising up the glass ; verily , my cup overfloweth . this white , creamy head sticks around for aeons . five minutes later , only an inch and a half has dissipated . there is also a constant cloud of bubbles rising from the bottom . clear golden colour . scattered lacing conspires to look like a piece of derivative modern art .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : master tmavy is served in a maroon-to-dark brown colour with a latte brown-coloured , rich and thick crown that remains for several minutes and leaves plenty of lacing on the master-goblet .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : bight copper colour , thin head that dissapears very fast , but eaves some lacing .	000000000000000000
1	a : black , light tan head , awesome retention & lacing .	0000000000000
1	a : pouring this beer is an adventure . make sure you are ready to spend some time . i poured into two large goblets to make the process move faster . regardless . watching the large thick beautiful head recede as it leaves lacing on the glass each time is a real treat . color is a bright golden color , as a bottle conditioned beer there is some yeast particles at the end of the pour . depending on your preference , your beer could end up quite hazey .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours into a duvel tulip pitch black with a 2-finger , rocky , mocha colored head on top . it shrinks down to a thick , full cap that is unwavering .	0000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : the bomber pours a light copper color with a nice fluffy eggshell colored two-fingered head . the beer releases massive carb bubbles , bigger than any carb bubbles i 've ever seen . this beer is almost hyperactive . results in inconsistent patchy foam , which happens to be a big turn-on for me ... indicates a very active , unique and lively beer . insane lacing everywhere ... all over the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : perfect . super dark with no highlights . thick 1 inch off-white head that slowly fades . awesome .	000000000000000000000
0	appearance : an aggressive pour got almost a two finger head of off-white foam . it quickly vanishes to nothing : not even a ring around the edges . hazy like a wheat beer should be but , a bit more floaties than i expect or want .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : the beer is a cloudy amber color . the beer pours with a thick white head that settles to a thin white lace as the beer is drank .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : clear yellow color , like urine	00000000

0	appearance : pale yellow , not much head , no lacing on the glass .	000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a very clear amberish red with a finger of loosely packed medium head . lots of bubbles rising quickly to the surface and tons of orangish light pours through this beer . leaves some great bright white lacing down the sides of the glass . awesome initial appearance .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : beautiful beer . big rocky medium cell head , amazing lacing , and great cover over a deep red brown body of crystal clarity .	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark brown , almost black color . a perfect two finger beige head forms and leaves nice sheets of lace . i would n't expect anything less from a beer on nitro .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : the pour is black , flat , and generally about the same as the other versions .	0000000000000000000
0	a : one finger head of decent cream and good thickness . retention is good . colour is a hazy orange . textbook hefeweizen appearance - which is a good thing . sm : orange peel citrus ester hops . light cream . maybe some lemon esters . a moderate strength aroma .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a solid two fingers off head the laces and retains decently but sadly suffers from a fairly clear and yellow body . there is a bit of clouding , but i usually expect a bit more from a wit .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours brown with a two-finger off-white head . head has pretty good retention and becomes rocky after some dissipation . leaves nice lacing .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a transparent dark brown with a thin off white head . not a good sign already . i was hoping for opaque black .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear yellow no head to speak of ( it 's better left in the green 40 oz bottle )	00000000000000000000000
0	a : murky , dark brown with some light penetrating the edges but less toward the center of the glass . minimal beige foam head present . no lacing remains . this beer looks less like a beverage but more like something one would find in an old , unmarked bottle stored in the garage .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : beautiful ! mahogany brown , brilliant clarity , and velvety tan head which lasted beyond expectation . score : 3 of 3 flavor : toasty upfront malt with a nice hop bitterness creeping in midway through the taste and riding out to the finish , nice transition , pleasant hoppiness in the aftertaste , well-balanced . score : 16 of 20	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : dark golden color ( very classic ) with very good head , but no retention .	000000000000000000
1	appearance : brownish red with a large head .	000000000
0	appearance : straw colored yellow with about a 1/4 of an inch of head that dissipates quickly . surprisingly good lacing on this beer .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : looked good . faint head that was white over blonde body .	00000000000000
0	appearance : this beer is seriously the color of my urine . in other words , it is a transparent , pale straw yellow with a few small bubbles .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : thankfully , the aroma gets this beer back on the right track with heavily toasted/lightly roasted malts , chocolate , coffee , caramel , smoke , and booze . what 's there is good , but the lack of foam is surely contributing to the lack of power and strength here .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a hazy grapefruit reddish brown with a finger width of faintly pink head that left good lacing . head is very velvety and creamy .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pretty much black with a nice and thick , foamy brown head .	000000000000000
1	a : poured amber nut brown from a 12oz . can into a guinness-style pint glass . in-between hazy and clear , with a beautiful , thick , two-finger head , and amazing sticky lacing . what an ipa should look like .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a light amber color , with a sub-one-finger head .	000000000000
1	appearance : poured a slightly cloudy golden straw color . four finger plus white foamy/pillowy head . plenty of visible carbonation . lacing/	00000000000000000000000
0	a : red , but filtered looking . i want more murkiness here ( like a rochefort 8 ) .	00000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear , rusty-copper color with 2 fingers of light beige head . foam takes its sweet time dissipating , leaving plenty of sticky lacing all over the glass . looks incredible .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a light tangerine orange . pretty clear with good carbonation heads about half inch and off white . it 's leaving good lacing already . looks very `` west coast ''	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : thin , dark black brew with almost no lacing or head ; average looking .	00000000000000000
1	a : beautiful clear red/dark amber color topped by a thick 2 finger off-white head .	0000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a clear slightly orangish golden color with a very short-lived head that was gone by the time i got done smelling the beer . there are hardly any bubbles rising , so the head does n't stand a chance .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy amber with a small white head around the rim of the glass .	0000000000000000
1	appearance : gorgeous opaque golden orange in color with a foamy eggshell white head .	000000000000000
1	a : perfect stout look : dark brown turning to black as it pours , a foamy finger or so of tan/brown head- thick and foamy enough that it began suspending drops of beer on top of it , a great sight to see . good head retention and lacing that coats the whole glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours light brown into the glass , with a very pretty ruby luminescence when held to light . pale , tight-ish head collapses quickly to a ring . no lacing . moderately aggressive visible carbonation , with fairly large bubbles . the lack of any lasting head is disappointing for the style .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this beer pours a murky , milk chocolate brown . a 1/4 inch of khaki colored head sits on top . head disappears immediately and leaves no lacing to speak of .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : thick , viscous , opaque . this is the thickest beer i have ever poured . big three fingers of brown head appears and leaves nice lace .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : super black , in glass and on the pour . almost no head what so ever . what was there was dark brown and had good retention and left alright lacing . beautiful beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : copper color with off-white head poured from a clear bottle .	0000000000000
0	a : no head and almost clear for its color .	00000000000
0	a : poured into a glass same as i would any other beer , but this beer foamed up a storm . left half of the glass with an annoying head that would not recede .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : there is so much yeast ! the yeast was crusted on the bottom of the bottle so i had to shake it up and let is settle out more evenly before opening the bottle . the body is an opaque , waxy amber and the head leaves a lot of lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : one-and-a-half-finger head right after pouring , but there 's no retention or lacing . color is indeed golden , and it looks rather thin . not too impressed .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours much like soda , lots of fizz sound . pokey looking head fizzles down to nothing after only 30 seconds or so . clear amber color . light carbonation .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : wow , if there is a picture perfect beer to look at for an iipa , kryptonite epitomizes it . a bit of haze probably from the cold but generally clear . a blending of golden/copper/bronze tones in the body all finished with a ridiculously creamy white head . the retention is spot on , as is the sticky lacing all over the glass . absolutely killer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pure white head with no lacing with little foam retention . the foam that is present is thin and slides right down the sides of the glass . as for color , its a pale yellow identical to that of cheap generic apple juice . eventually , the head actually dissipates and you can see the yellow brew if you look straight down at the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : nice light , pours lively , bubbly at first with a good head that stays for a few minutes , surprisingly long for a lager . it 's very pale and strawlike in color ; and common on the bottle is sweet ! ! ! stubby !	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : deep brown , clear , without suspended yeast , with short cap of off-white head and little to now lacing .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a typical pale yellow , with a thin fizzy white head .	000000000000000
0	a : an attractive clear , burnished wood glow that fades golden near the edges . minimal lacing .	0000000000000000000
1	appearance : large foamy head with a tan top and enequal bubbles . with the first sip , the foam laces the glass nicely and then continues throughout . the color almost reminds me of a dark apple cider .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : wow , awesome looking brew . huge pillowy fluffy head with extremely heavy lacing . rich golden coloring . got ta rate it a 5 .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dull , pale yellow . no haziness . weak head .	0000000000000
1	a : pours a four finger tan head of brilliant cream and thickness . i want this beer to have my babies . sm : whiskey ( shocker ! ) , alcohol , maybe some roast . the alcohol/whiskey scent masks the underlying notes . let 's hope the taste unveils them .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark ruby brown , with a full of-white head with great retention , some lacing .	00000000000000000000
0	a : really rustic cider orange that immediately makes me think this bottle might be a bit older than i 'd like , there 's a lot of barley wine character in the visual that furthers my suspicions . a modest off-white yellowish orange sticky bubble formation forms some weak but present lacing along the sides of the glass . a thin half-transparent film hugs the circular ring of the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured into a small goblet , brigand poured a hazy , golden hue . head and lacing were minimal to almost non-existant .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark mahogany in color , very clear when held up to the light . nice frothy lasting tan head . some sticky lacing too .	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : wow , flawless . light straw colored cloudy brew topped with a white soapy almost meringue like head . some good carbonation . my first 5 rating ever .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : bright straw body topped with a huge rocky white head to moderate retention leaving behind a heavy lace and creamy cover .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : there was so much carbonation or alcohol bubbles visible that it was very hard to tell the color . from what i gathered it was a yellow-orange color that poured a very bubbly head . the head had good retention , but left lacing on the glass . there was also very little film left on the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : nice , clean light brown color	00000000
1	a : simply put , one of the prettiest dubbels i 've seen : deep ruby/garnet , excellent clarity at first ( when held to light , otherwise a browner drabness ) showcasing a cascade of small carbonation . later , when nearing the bottom of the can , an unfiltered haze takes over . not a tall head , but certainly a long-lived one : this 1/2 '' lid of ivory cream sat unmoving for the better part of ten minutes .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured from a bottle to a tulip glass . had a golden yellow color and a mostly clear consistency . there was a thin amount of foamy head that quickly dissipated . no real lacing to speak of .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : light yellow , with a little small head , however it was highly carbonated so it almost reminded me of the appearance of semi-flat soda .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : copper with a finger of very dense ecru head that dissipate quickly . it looks very nice with the head . there is ragged lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours an opaque inky black body . a 1/8 '' light brown head fades quickly to a thin ring around the edge of the glass and a blob of bubbles in the middle . thin sticky strings of lacing are left behind . it looks a lot like a decent ris .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : beer colored water . no head at all .	00000000000
0	appearance : golden/orange/copper color . atop sits a white head that decides this is n't the place for him and splits . however , he leaves a little of himself behind with a decent lace that lets you know ... yes , this is a beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : perfect ! pitch black with no light shining through . very thick mocha colored head that never completely disappears .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : tan yellow colored beer , white head	000000000
0	appearance : appallingly weak head with soda-like carbonation ; large , plentiful , fast-moving bubbles in a clear , attractively rust-orange body .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : poured a good deep black with a 1 finger dense head that was slow to dissappate .	0000000000000000000
0	a : appearance is really not impressive to me . pours a light golden color , slight whitish head .	00000000000000000000
0	a : medium yellow/gold color . minimal head formation ( this beer was served really cold ) and retention . decent lacing persists .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear dark red color under a billowing light tan head that took its time fading into a rocky film that left great lacing down the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this was easily the best part of this beer . it was a dark brown in color with a 1.5 finger light tan head .	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dirty brown color with a large , tight , off-white head . the head quickly dissipates to a thin layer and leaves good lacing behind .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : colour is the gold of a macro ( carlton draught ) . the head is decent and the lacing is good . 4	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : if i could score a beer on look alone , magnat would be a winner . the brilliant gold color has nice clarity , and very active carbonation from tiny bubbles . those bubbles hold up a firm pillow-like white cap that stays with the beer all the way down the glass . a very heavy lace is deposited in the beer 's wake .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : black , slight ruby tinge , no head !	00000000000
0	a : deep copper ( much lighter than the uff da ) , very light-tan head , very little retention , initial leg/lace . ( does n't look like a doppelbock . )	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : opaque cherry plum color . first pour gave me a lot of head . second pour gave me a full glass with two and a half fingers of fizzy pink head that falls quickly and leaves no lacing . some small floaties pushed around from the constant and intense stream of bubbles from the bottom of the glass . 3.5	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : about a finger of white frothy head bubbles up and dissipates quickly . the lager is a golden straw hue . there 's a small island of foam floating at the top as well as a ring clinging to the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : crystal clear golden yellow color , boarding on that neon cheap beer look . hardly any head . not the best looking beer .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : hmm , did n't expect this . like the regular and coffee varieties , this one is n't very sexy . i dare say it 's worse . pours thick with a rich black color . just a half finger of medium brown fizzy soda pop head that falls at breakneck speed . no surprise to see no lacing . 4.5	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : true to style , a hazy golden color . sedimentation on the bottom is obvious . thin , barely there head that vanishes on the instant .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : big pop ! on opening . pours a deep red gold and amazing clarity , 2.5 fingers of marbled ivory head with tight bubbles appears and never quite leaves , active small bubbled carbonation continually rises . nice lacing throughout .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours dark brown , half finger head that recedes slowly , no lace , huge chunks , not very appealing	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : huge-floaty alert ! ! a gi-normous foamy , rocky head , great lacing , but , damn , tons of sediment . very authentic looking .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a cloudy amber color with a finger of off white head . this beer has amazing head retention with a solid layer of head remaining throughout the pour .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : almost no head , almost coppery gold body , no carbonation visible . n : luscious , juicy melons . sweet watermelon and sour honey dew melon rinds . sweet malts	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a very dark brown , black from a distance , with a thick , very creamy head , which leaves gobs of lacing and has great retention .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : oily black color , no head , no carbonation .	000000000000
0	a : clear , with little head	0000000
1	appearance : pure mahogany darkness . nearly black , completely opaque . beautiful beige head with sticky ridges of lacing .	000000000000000000000
1	a : poured hard into a pint glass this beer has a short white head that dissipates extremely quickly . the beer looks beautiful when first poured with a coppery reddish color and a bright white head .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : tons of white fluffy head . large bubbles . caramel-orange in color .	000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a cloudy , orange-yellow body with a discouragingly small-sized , fizzy , white head . no amount of vigorous swirling can seem to resuscitate it .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : little visible carbonation but a huge soapy head with excellent retention . golden yellow , transparent .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : a murky burnt orange in color , poured smoothly and creamy , creme colored creamy head , stuck to the sides of the glass	00000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : the body has a deep orange amber color with a few random and tiny bubbles of carbonation here and there . its clarity is very good as well . the head is very thick and creamy with about a two and a half finger thick ness . it is light tan in color and very long lasting which makes for nice sticky rings of lacing on the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured into a duvel sniffter ; big deep brown with just a little light shining through ; huge dense tan head with excellent retention and lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : even a pretty aggressive pour ca n't generate much in the way of head on this one . just the thinnest off-white ring remains about half a minute after the pour . the beer itself is a nearly opaque dark brown with hints of burgundy . still appears pretty carbonated . not a pretty beer by any means .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a clear , very dark reddish-brown body with a moderately-sized , off-white head .	00000000000000000
1	appearance : pours with a decent level of carbonation that aids the initial formation of a smooth 1 beige head that soon settles to a covering . the beer is has a lovely russet brown color that is perfectly clear . average levels of conditioning the head is reinstated when the beer is swirled .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : nice gold color , just the slight bit cloudy , one-finger head that is just off white , good carbonation	0000000000000000000000
1	a : this beer really starts off well , looks good , clear deep amber with a pillowy head that resuces to sticky lace .	0000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : murky brown-black glass with a small light tan head that collared but didnt lace . flavor : wow . a lot of the triple bock flavors , but just not condensed like the triple . very sweet with a syrupy taste , some spiciness that i think is hop induced . it has lots of maple , a good dash of rum ( with alcohol note ) and hints smoke ; complex study in dark .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours pitch black . no real head to speak of but some slight bubbles and whisps of foam . standard barrel aged stout .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : not good , seemed to be carbonated but there was no head . hazy light straw color	0000000000000000000
0	a : poured a bright , coppery , orange-amber color with a one finger head of tightly clustered bubbles which left little lacing and did not retain well .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : deep and slight cloudy honey light gold . big white foam head fades into a thin white layer .	000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a hazy straw with a big foamy head .	000000000000
1	appearance : a thick dusting of stick lace is all over the glass , good head retention with a nearly pitch black color to the brew .	000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : the cork burst from the bottle and i thought it might be a gusher but very little foam spilled from the lip ; in the glass , the beer was all head , however , but eventually it settled down , with plenty of foam clinging to the side and very good retention ; needless to say , the liquid was a rusty cherry color capped by a pinkish lavender head	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a opaque brownish-black with a little bit of tan head that quickly dissipates . there 's a bit of lacing as well , but overall this beer does n't appear to be super carbonated .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : very dark brown body almost black with no head and no lacing . nothing too impressive .	0000000000000000000
1	appearance : a dark garnet , clear as a gem , with a beautiful frothy tan head that lasted for the duration . very good visual appeal .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dark for a hefe , cloudy , imho not as pretty as traditional hefe yellow	00000000000000000
0	appearance : coal black with a light layer of lacing on top .	0000000000000
1	appearance : pours a magnificent obsidian , with a huge head that settles slowly and coats the glass with lace	00000000000000000000
0	a : dark amber , light brown . light carbonation continues to rise throughout . pours into a quarter finger , bubbly , white head . head quickly deteriorates entirely . some spotty lacing quickly retreats into the body of the brew .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours the lightest of the light , transparent straw color that produces a tiny head with no lacing along the glass ... ( i ca n't believe i have to wash a pint glass after drinking this ) .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a nice amber hue with a small cream colored head . no real retention with just a few spots of lace .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear , deep vermillion body with a ridiculously persistent , creamy off-white head . this head seriously will not dissipate at all . i ca n't believe that i 'm looking at an 11 % beer - wow .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dark copper , with a small head .	0000000000
0	a : golden-amber with brown undertones . good carbonation . the only unfortunate finding is a minimal head and very poor retention . if this was an english bitter , served at the pub it would be spot on . with my fest-style beers i like a bit more cabesa .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : murky , medium rusty brown with one finger of diminishing cinnamon-tinted foam head . no lacing remains on the glass .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a perfectly clear amber color with dark honey highlights against the light . the head is a fluffy off-white cap of foam that retains very well , leaving substantial sudsing down the glass as it recedes . as i sip , there are thick register marks left behind . outstanding .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : almost no head , dissipating almost immediately . a somewhat murky ruby color	000000000000000

1	appearance : black , with a big , brown , foamy head .	0000000000000

0	appearance : golden maber color . poor head and no lacing . lager like	00000000000000
0	appearance : nice golden liquid with a steady , sparce large bubble carbonation . head is patchy , practically dead , less some large bubbles surfacing . it does however turn to a creamy lace as you start drinking it , and even has a slight stick to it .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : muddy , dark brown ( not black ) body with large shades of reddish amber around the edges . a wimpy ( 1/8 inch ) , tight , light brown head sits on top and retains decently . does n't look at all like your typical nitro-head ; much looser and smaller . decent lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : crystal clear yellow beer ? the bottle says amber . this is a blonde/cream ale by the color	00000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours out a clear , light copper body with steady effervescence feeding a slender white head .	0000000000000000000
1	appearance : mahogany brown hue , with a thick off-white head .	000000000000
1	a : the beer pours pretty much black with a dense , creamy khaki head .	0000000000000000
1	appearance : after reading all the reviews talking about how syrupy this beer tasted i was a little surprised to see it look like a somewhat normal ipa . nice transparent copper color with a thin head comprised of tiny bubbles .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : deep apple cider color . abosolutly no head . this beer is flat . it really just looks like wort in the glass .	00000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : 2.5	000
0	a : pours with low/no visible carbonation . no head .	00000000000
0	appearance : over-carbonated , thought it was going to gush out . pours thick chunky off-white half a pint glass of head . orangeish amber color . particulates floating in the beer . do n't think i poured the sediment in but could have . flavor : major grapefruit up front , followed by some pine and tangerine . a weird solvently hair spray flavor lingering in aftertaste . decent malt backbone . high bitterness .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : golden yellow not a thick head	00000000
0	a : golden straw pour , not really any head at all . almost yellow .	0000000000000000
1	a : deep ruby red body that appears jet black for all intents and purposes . with a 1.5cm white head that leaves rings as it goes down , guinness has the appearance of a quintessential irish stout .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : black with brown highlights , totally opaque . the first pour produces a perfect 3 finger head and the retention on this thing was ridiculous , it never came close to receding .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : not what i expected . this was my first smutty ipa and i did n't read the bottle first . i poured from a bottle into my harpoon glass and immediately was disturbed by the floating sediment . it poured a nice golden orange color like any ipa should with a nice one finger head . not much lacing either . i stared at the sediment and finally decided to try the beer . i was not sure what was going on with it , but i tried it anyway . after my first sip i finally read the bottle and noticed it was unfiltered . that explains it , full steam ahead on this beer now !	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : very clear , light amber color with one finger of off-white foam head that diminishes to a large and persistent pad . heavy lacing remains on the glass and an occasional solitary bubble rises in the column .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : upon opening , i get a huge carbonation crack . after an average pour , i 'm left with 1 inch of liquid and 5 inches of white head that does n't want to budge . the liquid is on par with miller lite .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear yellow with two fingers of white head that recedes into a thin ring with little lacing .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : pours pitch black , completely opaque . huge 2+ finger , dark brown foamy head . dissipates in a couple minutes to a thin mocha froth . could n't be any better , this is a picture perfect looking stout .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours near black with a thick , bubbly , dark tan head that slowly faded into a thick fuzzy film .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : a very dark brown color . you would think it was opaque , but holding it up to the light makes the red highlights in the brew show up . there was almost no head at all even with an aggressive pour . there was not enough bubbles left after what little head was there settled to leave any lacing at all .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : motor oil . a black hole from which no light can escape . body : silky smooth , full body .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : the liquid is hazy , light golden , almost orange in colour . the head is white , thick and foamy , and fades slowly .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : served in a goblet , it pours a clear and bright orangey-golden hued nectar , with a 1cm thick white pillowy head with good retention , and the lacing is nice and tight too . initial lively carbonation quickly settles to gentle streams of fizz .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : one finger head that dissipates pretty quick . very clear golden color .	000000000000000

1	appearance : coal black with a thin tan head .	0000000000
0	appearance : a small amount of head , but this falls away qucikly . beer has a slight chill haze to it . medium brown in color with a lot a orange tint .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a beautiful dark black with a half inch head . curious light white setiment around the middle of the glass .	000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a dark jet black color in the body of the beer . there was a one finger head that last all but a second . there is effervescence in the beer but only visible by it bubbling on the top of the beer . the clarity of the beer is a black as the black hole .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a very cloudy , very dark amber with hints of ruby when held to light . looks gold around the edges . head is creamy and khaki-colored , and retains pretty well . looks sticky too - leaves spotty lacing . lots of large , yeast sediment floating around in the body . pete just found a strawberry skin in his . wtf ? p : 4.5 ; j : 4.5 ; n : 4.5	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : opaque brownish orange color . one finger of soapy head with less poor retention and some lacing . 4.5	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a lovely copper mahogony color with a nice 2 '' head that lasts quite a while .	00000000000000000000
0	a : light to medium gold , with a very short , quickly dissipating head . average slow rising carbonation .	000000000000000000000
0	a : clear light copper . head , retention , and lacing are dismal . maybe it lost some juice in the growler is what im hoping .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : flat , no carb ; golden yellow , very clear	000000000000
0	a : a light yellow with a quickly fading heading , very unimpressive .	00000000000000
0	a : even on a very hard pour , little to no head at all . a mm cap on top , made of tiny little off white bubbles . not impressive . limited lacing as well . color however was good , a deep dried oak leaf brown , with the classic hazy color of an weizen .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a remarkably hazy pale orange color . carbonation is still visible , despite the yeasty `` fog '' . a thick fluffy white head rises magnificently as the beer pours . good head retention as well . this is a great looking beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a straw , piss yellow with a quick fizzy , shock white head that very quickly settles into into nothing and leaves zero lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : orange and copper colored beer give way to a massive 3 '' head that slowly dissipates . the head is an eggshell color with plenty of lacing on the sides of the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a hazy translucent copper with a mild white head . average head retention , no lace .	00000000000000000000
0	a : hazy straw/gold body topped with a half-inch white foam head - this after a fairly vigorous pour . underwhelming retention and next to no lace . a good swirl of the glass produces a larger head , but it too disappears quickly without a trace .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : amber in color with thin white head that remains for a while in a foamy layer across the top . 5 minutes after pouring you can still see little streams of carbonation running up from the bottom of the glass . half way through the beer , the head has mostly dispersed but leaves beautiful lacing on the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours nice and dark . very little head and what there is fades fast .	00000000000000000
1	a : amazing looking beer . crystal clear with a light amber hue and a nice white head that stayed seemingly forever and left huge amounts of lacing down the glass . i am in love .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : slightly cloudy amber with constant bubbles and a solid one-finger white head with lacing .	00000000000000000
0	a : ugly large bubbles and clumpy looking melted marshmallow head that i do n't want to drink . pale clear gold body .	000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : nice deep brown color with an offwhite colored head . but i wanted to see more of a deep red .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : the cork came off with a slight pop , but no haze when looking into the bottle neck . a tall pour results in some wispy lacing and bubbles at the edges . there is n't much activity but upon closer inspection - there are some tiny bubbles cascading up the sides of the glass - very faint .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a nice , dark brown color with a thin head and ... massive chunks of yeast . was this beer supposed to be strained ?	000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a clear , pale yellow body with a fizzling inch of pure white bubbles , though it departs at a rapid pace .	00000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : first of all , it 's not red . it 's more auburn/cloudy dark orange in colour , and that was under substantial lights . an unusual colour anyway . poured into a tripel karmeliet glass with no head whatsoever , even in a scored glass , and it eventually settled to a very thin film . carbonation is also low , although the scattered lacing is attractive .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : half-inch , frothy white head dissipates very slowly . pours hazy orange and leaves waves of lacing everywhere .	000000000000000000000
0	a : light yellow , tiny white head , 0.1 finger , a bit of lacing . sickly looking - not appetizing .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : clear amber under a small white head . no lace or retention .	000000000000000
1	a : a very dark brown/red ; only barely translucent . when aggressively poured , it formed a creamy , distinctly tan , two-finger head . also leaves behind some great lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy reddish brown with a weak white head that is very short-lived .	000000000000000
0	a : pale staw brew , pours thick white frothy head . very poor retention .	0000000000000000
1	a : medium amber with bright golden undertones ( looks extremely inviting ) . not much of a head to speak of aside from a thin lace . its mostly clear , but i can tell there is a lot going on in there .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pale gold cloudy , with a thin head .	00000000000
0	a : pours a golden amber , almost brown , with a small smattering of bubbles as the head , but for most of the drink , it is headless .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : there 's a reason no one really pours this into a glass . it 's a very very very pale beer , just not appealing looking at all with almost no head or the alternate of half the glass being carbonation .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a regular poured lager that has a quickly vanishing light foam head . based purely on looks , there are plenty of other choices that look more appealing .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a big billowy head , as high as 5 fingers , and settling around three . it 's white with bubbles of all shapes and sizes in there . the head has tons of texture as i keep it filled to the tip top of the glass , sticking at times almost an inch over the top . the beer is an amber/golden with pretty good carbonation . i 'd say this is a pretty attractive beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : gold color with lots of yeast floaters and a distinct chill haze . poured a 1 finger whted head that dissipated to a skim . decanted continually . lacing washed down the sides of the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a straw yellow color . poor head retention as a decent white head evaporates rather quickly and is eventually lost altogether . no lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours an absolutely beautiful vibrant yellow orange with an angelic haziness . a medium pour produces two inches of dense white head . poured into my weihenstephan glass . dear god , a half inch of foamy head is lingering . i can tell just from the look of this beer that it will be very good .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear mahogany color , abundant and long-lasting cream-colored head falls into a thick cap with lovely lacing .	00000000000000000000
1	a : hazy orange with thin quickly disspearing white head	0000000000
1	a : dark , opaque black-vermillion body with a lovely 3 '' head of frothy , creamy tan foam ; good retention and light lacing . great looking beer .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a nice ruby red color with lively carbonation and no lace ... but there 's a glob of sediment/protein/whatever it is floating around on top , and that 's just disgusting . had to remove before i could start drinking .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a deep , beautiful orange-amber with a huge , thick , sticky , off-white head . the whole scene is beautiful except that in lingering , the head wears on my patience for a sip . the beer is clear in color and hue , but dense and translucent . the head eventually subsides , leaving an inviting sticky lacing . this is a very inviting , attractive beer that pretty perfectly matches my idealized vision of an ipa .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark , dim garnet with little head and good clarity .	0000000000000
0	appearance : deep brown , almost black . no head , and not any lacing .	0000000000000000
0	a : very dark brown and opaque . hardly any head ( may need to bottle condition longer )	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : unlike most wheat beers that i 've tasted , this one does n't seem to be as dark or cloudy as others . it 's color is a vibrant yellow that 's a bit murky . moderate head formation with decent retention and minimal visible carbonation .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : murky brown with some maroon hues intertwined , topped with a moderately fluffy and slightly off-white head . honestly , it 's kind of an ugly beer to look at , really nothing attractive here at all . it looks sort of like darkened pureed strawberries .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : excessive head on an easy pour , the head dropped quickly , no noticeable lacing though there is the thinnest layer of persistent foam , light to medium amber in color - 3.25 ,	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : spot on . pours a very dark amber burgundy . around a 39 on srm color guide . this bottle gave a good two finger head that diminished after about 5 minutes to very fine layer that remained for the rest of the glass . lacing is moderate , but clings firmly in place , not slowly gliding down the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark black , so dark i can see my reflection in the beer glass . a nice head with some lacing as it is consumed .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a 1 finger foamy , bubbly head with poor retention . the color of the beer is a medium straw color with yellow hues . the clarity of the beer is hazy . the head is white and left some lacing on the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pretty light golden color , almost clear with a light white head that does n't last long .	00000000000000000000
1	appearance : fine-looking murky copper body with a creamy , off-white head . plenty of lacing throughout .	000000000000000000
1	a : bbl is near black , only showing mahogany highlights when held to the light . lacing is fantastic , with millions of microscopic bubbles frantically racing to the head of the brew . the head is also noteworthy ; its pillowy texture is marked by a cream color and everlasting retention .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a brilliantly clear caramel to amber color with a rich and creamy white head . the beer displays excellent head retention and a nice lacing along the glass . strong and lively carbonation bubbles race to the top of this beer , sustaining the head nicely . flavor : first to hit the tongue is a vinous alcohol character that is quickly followed by a wet paper oxidized flavor . some subtle notes of raisin and caramel , though these only last for a moment through the middle before the alcohol takes over again . the malt fades to the back as the alcohol heats up through the finish , leaving the beer rather hot and dry . if you look for it you can find some light candy sweetness trying to work it 's way into the mix , but the oxidation and alcohol dominate the flavor .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : this beer is a reddish copper/amber with a very little head	0000000000000
1	a : pours a dark copper , with a 2 finger head that settles into a small cap , and leaves sticky lacing all over the glass . every drink leaves more lacing too . this is the best lacing i 've come across to date . off to a good start .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : blond color , small head of foam , manny bubbles are n't seen as commonly seen in this style ;	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : the bottle misled me slightly . it was such a departure from the typical look of a porter bottle wise . this produced some pretty big head which could have partially been because i poured it into such a large stein . very light brownish tint to the head.it was very dark in color similar to a cola .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a good amount of sediment is suspended in the orange amber beer . some thin , off-white head dissipates quickly leaving no spotting . much more orange in color and lighter than the 2009 .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : really , you 're calling this a wheat beer ? heavily filtered , it looks more like a pale lager . brilliant light gold . a reasonable pour yields a 1.25 finger head and thin , mediocre lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours out a clear , cheery-looking yellow body with a fluffy layering of white suds .	000000000000000000
0	a : a classic golden yellow . a medium pour produces 1/2 inch of coarse white head that quickly fades to near nothing . average .	00000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : very dark brown with red hues lower down the glass . opaque throughout but so dark at the top of the pint glass that it was very difficult to see through . biege , tight creamy head , receding to leave good lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : lemony yellow ( duh ) i poured vigorously and got a decent head but it quickly faded into a slick on the top . not much lacing but i was n't expecting it to have much .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : this porter beer has a dark color	000000000
1	appearance : in its natural pint glass this apa pours with a massive 4 finger head . which dissipates slowly into a rather white lacing that is a head in itself . the remainder clings to the glass with a thick viscosity . you already know this is a hoppy beer . beer pours perfectly clear . the color is dark amber with a hint of reddish hue . it gets a 5 this is just a fantastic thing to behold .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a bright golden yellow with an amazing white foamy head	0000000000000
0	a : small 1 finger white foamy/fizzy head with medium retention . the everlasting collar of small bubbles is aided by active streamers along the glass . the body has a soft , glowing pale golden yellow hue and is cloudy . minimal sediment . the color of this brew is attractive but all other appearance attributes are merely average or below . no lacing at all .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : single finger tan head with excellent retention lots of lacing . very dark . no light getting through .	000000000000000000000
1	a : really gorgeous brown amber . the thinner portions of the glass ( allagash glass ) change from brown to a ruby red . perfect tan fluffy head . 2+ fingers . i have n't even taken a sip and there 's already lacing going on ! this beer literally looks like the perfect winter warmer in my opinion .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : opened with almost no sound and poured the same . absolutely no head , even with a vigorous pour . murky body , brown and ruby colored , no lace and no retention ( obviously ) . bleak , sad looking beer to be honest .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : orange with a slightly orange white head with good lacing .	0000000000000

0	a : clear dark orange body with one inch white head which had pour retention . leaves very little lacing	00000000000000000000
1	appearance : clear amber color with a very large slightly tan head that stays for a very long time and leaves lots of lace . many bubbles rising from the bottom .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : reasonably light , straw yellow body with a head that flattens quickly but remains consistent throughout drinking ...	00000000000000000000
1	a : an exceptionally aggressive pour into my dfh snifter resulted in a jet black body with a half inch mocha colored head .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a very thick/cloudy red-amber with a small white head that fizzles out . some noticeable carbonation and decent lacing .	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : beautiful brown head had a little cascading action after it was first poured . the body is , unsurprisingly , jet black . lacing is very nice .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : ah , easily one of the best aspects of this beer , and probably one of the greater things that make it a bit misleading as a whole ... pour is like dark coffee brown and shows some very dark ruby/mahogany highlights when held up to the light ; starts with an awesome thick , full and creamy head -- it freaking looks like someone just painted it in the glass it looks so damn perfect ; head has good retention from the additional gas ; body is nearly entirely opaque ;	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a nice orange-yellow with 2 fingers of head that lingers a while leaving a great skim that hangs the entire session and some lacing on the glass	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : awful . i wish there was a `` 0 '' of negative value . bud light has the worst appearance of any beer . an old service industry trick for when you have a bud light and any other very pale colored beer ( pilsner , light lager , etc ) and lose track of the two is to take the lightest colored one to grab the bud light .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured an extremely pale hazy yellow . this is probably the closest to white i 've ever seen in a beer . sitting on top the pale brew was an enormous four finger rocky head . it stuck around until the end and left some large splotchy lines of lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a cascading tan colour that reveals a clear , light brown colour with tiny , tiny rising carbonation bubbles . it has a very think , creamy head that has excellent retention and leaves a nice sticky lace .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a hard pour gives a decent 3 finger , pure white head . body is pale yellow and clear . retention is rather good .	000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : another non careful pour is invoked to stir up a few fingers of head . the beer pours a dark copper and amber color with two fingers of head . a few swirls in the snifter does n't produce very much lace . just a streak or two that trickles its way back into the beer . when held up to the light there is very little effervescence making me think that i 'll enjoy the mouthfeel quite a bit . the beer really is a beautiful color .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : looked like an ipa , okay cool !	0000000000
0	appearance : peach in colour with some slight chill haze and free floating solids .	000000000000000
1	appearance : poured into a 22 oz weizen glass . the color of this is amazing . an odd rainbow of deep ruby red to pale amber . a huge frothy white head sits atop and holds strong . lacing is excellent . a picture perfect beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : when poured it had a nice thich one finger head that was a white color with little hints of burnt red that clung to the gobblet all the way to the bottom of the glass	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : very dark . darker than imaginable . no light seems able to escape its truly a visual experience to try to pick out color and light . the head is decent and well coloured , but fades quickly .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : clear , mahogany color with a big , three-finger tan , fluffy head	000000000000000
0	a : half finger of poor retention . very thin and devoid of cream . clear yellow colour . sm : buttery and hoppy . treated butterscotch mixed with barley . a very light strength scent .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : cloudy light orange ; billowy head ; great lacing and abundant carbs ; nice job !	000000000000000000
0	a : very cloudy , dark brown . you can see particles in it as you pour . a good head that fades quickly to a thin collar leaving heavy lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear , light amber color with over one finger of diminishing peachy foam head . heavy lacing remains on the glass .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : gentle pour yields a 2 finger frothy white head with very good retention . beer is an attractive , slightly cloudy bright lemon . lacing is frothy , thick , and ring-like and has great cling .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : small , loose head . completely clear , yellow . high carbonation activity .	0000000000000000
0	a : pours a translucent goldenrod , very much witbier like . fizzy soapy head , no lace , good head retention .	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : very dark brown in color..nearly black . the off-white head is the best quality of this brew ... even after a somewhat mild pour , the head grows surprisingly large in the glass and absolutely does n't dissapate . it just sits ... waiting for you to drink it . as you drink , the extremely frothy head leaves a tan lacing on the glass that does n't go away..it will eventually dry and harden to the glass if you leave it long enough . very impressive out of a medium-bodied stout like this .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : bright gold color hints of orange , completely crystal clear , typical for a filtered beer but not really my cup of tea . a perfectly white foam head appears , and than runs for cover quickly .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : slightly cloudy orange colour and excellent 1 cm head that lasts . 4.5	000000000000000
0	a : pours with a head that almost immediately dissipates , leaving zero lacing , very disappointing for an ipa , looked like cider .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy light straw with three fingers bone-white head . no retention at all and absolutely no lacing . lots of little carbonation bubbles . pale and fizzy looking .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours up dark brown , almost black , with red highlights . the tan head dissipates quickly .	00000000000000000000
1	appearance : down right black with about two fingers worth of head nice head retention very frothy and thick leaves lace from start to finish . aromas : dried fruit notes very small malt notes as well .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : standard pour yields a 3 finger frothy off-white colored head with outstanding retention . beer is an opaque black and lacing is patchy and stringy with excellent cling . this one 's a real beauty .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : slightly hazy golden yellow color with the stereotypically large saison-head .	0000000000000
0	appearance : fizzy and thin but surprisingly dark - a fairly deep orange-cinnamon . head retention is not very good .	000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours with maybe half a finger of medium tan head . this settles extremely quickly , leaving absolutely nothing behind . the beer itself is a rich copper hue , very pretty . no sediment in the bottle .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : light golden , international lager style . white foam , creamy , medium sized bubbles .	000000000000000000
1	appearance : beautiful . simply one of the absolute best looking lagers i 've ever seen . from the insanely attractive dark gold with lively carbonation bubbles dazzling in the light , to the crystal-clear body to the thick , foamy , smooth white head ... this can easily make any other lager i 've seen turn its head , and even many ales . its color is similar to dortmunder gold , but quite a bit darker with a more amber/brown tinge to it ; in my opinion , much more appealing visually . i could go on and on , but really ... it has to be seen to be believed . downright amazing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : it has a dull golden color with a light head which dissipates almost immediately .	00000000000000000
0	a : pours black with 1.5 fingers of tan head . poor retention , almost zero lace ; nothing special here . swirling the glass summons absolutely nothing . barrier , i am disappoint .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : clear yellowish orange color with a 3 '' fluffy head that lasts . some nice lacing developed during the session .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : the beer is golden yellow in color and has a light to moderate amount of carbonation . it poured with a finger high white head that quickly dissipated , leaving lacy patterns of bubbles on the surface .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : crystal clear dirty blonde hue with a thin ring of lace that struggles to stay . fizzy looking .	000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a deep brown/almost purple color with no head ( is that normal ? ) . no lacing .	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a jet black with a beautiful , creamy , red tinted 2 finger head that dissipates within a few minutes and leaves some lacing around the edge of my glass . this stout is pure eye candy .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : a bright straw yellow with virtually no head and no lacing .	00000000000000
1	appearance : poured into a duvel sniffter ; beautiful orangey gold with a nice foamy off white head , spotty stickage , good retention and great sipping lacing ... the most impressive thing about this one was the northern lights looking haze in the beer itself ... wild	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pitch black , it has a bad head with weird bubbles and an extremely thin lace .	0000000000000000000
0	a : pours a very clouded straw yellow with two fingers of white head that thins to a half finger and hangs around for the rest of the experience but leaves no lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear pale amber body with a voluminous 3-finger white head that 's dense and creamy enough to rise half an inch above the tulip 's rim without me worrying in the least about overflow . retention is stellar , and there 's plenty of pillowy lace left all around the sides of the glass . maybe a half-shade darker than most pilsners , but i 'm not complaining at all . gorgeous beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pecan brown , with next to no head .	00000000000
0	a : pours a rustic yellow with some orange tinting , decent clarity but not perfect . about a 1 finger head forms and holds for a bit before falling to a skim . good lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours golden yellow with a thing white head . very `` macro '' looking in the glass .	00000000000000000000
0	a : pours amber and pinkish with a decent frothy , lively cap of white head which recedes to a ring . no lacing .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : golden with a haze . large chunks of yeast . white foamy head with decent retention .	0000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured a syrupy , black liquid out of a majestic looking 16.9oz bottle . topped with a pillowy head colored a faint tan . definitely does not skimp on the head , as it presents a full three fingers . lacing is thick and abundant .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : crystal clear . no head . not to style ...	000000000000
0	a : a hazy , golden color with fizzy head that dissipates quickly .	00000000000000
0	a : pours a pale yellow with a tinge of orange to it . less than one finger of foam leaves pretty quickly , leaving just a little lace . this looks almost macro lagerish .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : slightly murky amber with big-bubbled white 2-finger head even with a slow pour with good foamy retention and a coating of lace down the glass . exquisite .	000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a dark amber brown with a thick off white head .	00000000000000
1	appearance : golden brown with a head that quickly vanished . little to no laceing .	0000000000000000
0	appearance : arrives inappropriately in a shakers pint glass , a hazy , turgid , muddy brown , truth be told a fairly unattractive hue , and the glass does it no justice , but i 'll forgive that as its likely a glassware shortage because of the release . though it arrives sans head , faint wisps of white lie on the surface , and a thin solid collar and faint smatterings of glittery lacing suggest a half finger of head had crowned this one . carbonation is very faint and very slow .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a completely opaque brownish body with a one-and-a-half finger tan head that 's incredibly dense , has good retention , and leaves a sheet of almost solid , rocky lacing down the side of the glass . the highlight of this beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a translucent black body . massive head . hmm .	0000000000000
1	appearance : pours black with one finger of tan head that quickly fades . minimal lacing .	00000000000000000
1	a : very nice dark orange/red looking beer . fully transparent . head is tan and ridiculously strong and lasting . very creamy looking head .	00000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : flat . free pour yields a small white froth ring around the surface of the glass that disappears immediately . by the way , if you 've read the tomme arthur interview about his flat beers , you may remember he pointed out that the beers his company unprofessionally sent to the market before they were carbonated were `` lightly carbonated '' and that the carbonation only `` expressed '' when served at room temperature . i did not refrigerate this beer , and it 's simply flat . pours a dark brown / black . 1.0 for appearance because i can see that it 's ( unintentionally ) flat , and i do n't want it to be flat . the same principle whereby i 'd give the beer a 1.0 if its color were green , even if it had a nice big head .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : pours gold with just a hint of red , and a thin head that fades relatively quickly , but leaves a bit of lacing .	000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : weihenstephaner hefeweissbier poured into a weizen glass delivers a wonderfully opaque , unfiltered gamboge colour , a sparse amount of bubbles ascend to the magnificently massive cream-white crown which withstands the fall of time in all its majesty for a long period , leaving its inheritance in the shape of sporadic lacing -- hail to the king !	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : mostly clear coppery color with an excellent frothy white head . head retention throughout the experience with white lacing down the glass .	0000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pale golden body , nice white head on the pour fades quickly to reveal a scum laden surface . looks like a cheap canned light beer . below average conditioning , i wonder if that is because of the plastic bottle , it shouldnt be considering the use of fizzy sodas i guess . bored , tired and flaccid looks .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : bright transluscent gold with a gleaming white head .	00000000000
1	appearance : pours a dark brown which ends up as nearly-opaque in the glass . head is medium-dark tan color which recedes leaving interesting bubbly lacing . not a bad start .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : the second the cap was off , the foam came pouring out of the bottle , and i mean pouring . i grabbed my glass and saved as much as i could ... .then the foam burst over the sides of my glass . grrr ... ok , i 'm back . body is a cloudy tangerine bronze with a bit of sediment . head was a towering mess of sticky froth but since has died down to a gentler wisp with a nice ring around the glass . webbing is covering all wides of the glass where the foam once was .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : really pale yellow color ( just like budweiser ) . fully translucent with a really strong pure white creamy looking head with really good retention and lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : a dark , imposing body that only allows a handful of dull ruby light to pass through . a big , sticky , toffee-colored head endures until the bottom of the glass , leaving terrific lacing on the way .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : few beers look better to be than guinness . if i imagine a dry stout in a glass with a thick head my mouth begins to water . the contrast of the light , faintly tan head pressed against the near-black ruby red body .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : thoroughly black body topped by a faint hint of brown foam that disappears straightaway and leaves minimal lace . boring .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy deep yellow/orange hue , no head , no lacing	000000000000
0	a : crystal clear pale yellow gold , about almost 2 inches of head , lots of effervescence . i 'm not sure i 've ever seen a filter saison , not a good first impression . looked more like a pislner ...	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : bitch black body with a nice thick creamy head ; about half an inch , which has excellent retention throughout the consumption of it . looks exactly as a good stout should . b : very nice here , i was pleased . caramel , coriander seed , light hints of honey , and burnt sugar . there was also a underlying sent of crisp winter air .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : very pale yellow , thin white head .	0000000000
0	appearance : the head is quick to form but then it drops down to only a very thin ring of lace . no stickage on the glass . nice clarity in the dark amber brown color .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : the body is a clear copper colour suggesting a vat conditioned macro filtered brew . head is foamy white and it dwindled down to an unremarkable thin lacing . nothing exciting here .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : thin head on a hard pour , the color is a dirty coffee brown , minor spots of sticky head - 3.00 ,	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : toasty malt , dark fruits , clove , caramel , and soft alcohol .	0000000000000000
1	appearance : brown with ruby edges . a tan chunky head . looks like a porter in the glass . again , i have no baseline for comparison .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : it pours hazy brown with a glowing tone . the head is large , white creamy and fluffy , it stays for a really long time , and leaves some lacings .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a very cloudy apple cider colored body . 3/4 '' off white head slowly fades to a thick film .	00000000000000000000000
0	appearance : impenetrable black with a porous khaki head and folds of lacing .	00000000000000

1	appearance : served in a sierra snifter ( what did you expect ? ) , pours thin , with a chestnut color as it comes out pretty atypical of an imperial stout . some glug and gurgle , and a classic one-finger head with a ton of big bubbles on top . head dies quickly , though , leaving only a white rim around the glass and some of those impressive bubbles . beyond the chestnut color , this is a very dark , almost black beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the 12oz bottle is quaint and says to use by october 2006 . the body of the beer is opaque and the head is the lasting , frothy tan you would expect of a good porter . unfortunately , as i immediately found out , the molasses make it look better than it tastes . additives - booo .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : normally , black as night without much head . if you look at it when it 's ( very ) backlit though , it has a bit of a red hue .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark brown/ruby red and clear . beer looks very thick ! no carbonation . shocker , i know . there 's more bubbles in the toilet after i pee . only way you were getting bubbles out of this bottle was to pour it from 3 feet .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured an absolutely enormous head that continued to balloon out well after the pour . hugely carbonated , like champagne . dark straw , light orange in color , perfectly clear . tons of lacing down the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : pours a slightly cloudy light amber color with two fingers of off white head . the head disappears completely leaving no trace .	0000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : the beer could n't manage to produce more than a centimeter head even with a violent pour . it left behind almost no lacing , and was an ugly translucent light yellow .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a really nice deep dark black with a nice thick caramel colored head that did n't stick around long enough . this was a beautiful beer when first poured but the head retention was poor . laced on the glass very nicely though .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : when i opened the bottle foam started pouring out . this occured for at least two minutes until i started pouring . pours a hazy golden color , the clarity improves after the carbonation has diminished leaving a sparkling beautiful brew . the beer is topped with a thick merengue-like head that is persistent , and leaves nice lace .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a beautiful hazy dark amber/brown color . a two finger head forms and sticks around . sticky lace is left in rings down my pint glass .	000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : reddish amber , tan head quickly falls into a minuscule cap , which then again quickly disappears completely , no lacing .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark , but not super dark on the pour . a 1 inch tan head that fades at a decent pace to a bubbly lace atop the brew . ok.	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a light , cloudy straw color . a little bit of golden-yellow in the right light ... a dull yellow in the wrong light . one finger of frothy white head , with poor retention .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : served a very deep brown body with an inch to two inches of lasting , faintly beige foam . yes , nitro beers can look pretty , but , so do glossy beer adds in magazine and they do n't taste great either .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a caramel color with a foamy head and a column of bubbles that rises steadily from the bottom throughout the course of the drink.. lots of thick , sticky lacing on the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : moderate pour yields 1 finger of rocky snow white head with poor retention . crystal clear very pale yellow liquid . very carbonated . better retention and darker yellow color with less fizz would be appreciated .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : black as cola with barely any head at all . no retention and minimal lacing . it 's not much do look at and overall unimpressive . very little carbonation , even for a stout .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear light orange color with loads of bubbles ascending the glass . head is nice which clings to the sides nicely the entire way down .	000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : one finger head of poor thickness , no cream , and poor retention . colour is a nontransparent copper . not so appealing . sm : caramelized malt , some corn of all things , and some light floral notes . a moderate strength scent .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear red-orange with a finger of off-white head that fades into a thin ring with no lacing .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : inert ; very thin head ; no lacing ; light yellow	0000000000000
0	a : the beer is a sort of dull and cloudy orange in the snifter . there is almost no head . there is one tiny piece of foam clinging to the glass , and it does n't look like it will last much longer . the beer looks forlorn .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : initially pours a cloudy deep brown color with a rich rolling to the foam as it settles like it does when you have it poured from the tap . it settles within a minute to leave a thick creamy tan head atop the opaque beer . lots of lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark brown and initial observation is that this is a very thin consistency . not your typical stout viscosity . head is a bit weak , but with an aggressive pour yields some nice almond colored foam , which quickly dwindles . minimal lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : an extremely dark brown that is nearly black capped off with a one finger espresso colored frothy head that stayed around for quite some time . lacing remained for the duration of the beer . a very nice looking beer indeed .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : cloudy , hazy & pale yellow body with lots of bubbles but a very thin ring that quickly dissipates .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : pours an opaque black with a fizzy short lived tan head . no lace .	00000000000000000
1	a : very deep walnut brown . poured with a good frothy tan head and leaves plenty of lacing .	00000000000000000000
1	appearance : extremely dark , opaque body . two-finger head the color of espresso froth , leaving irregular spots of lacing . simply a gorgeous brew .	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : wow . surprisingly good look to this ... could be this be the first decent leinenkugel brew ? thick tow finger head that simmers into a thin lacing . great dark brown color .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pale yellow golden beer : it does n't exactly look special .	00000000000000
1	a : the beer is a deep ruby red with just a slight brown hue . the head is decent with a beige color that does not leave much lace at all . the color though , wow !	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : unfortunately for me , i am underwhelmed so far . the beer barely had any off-gas when i popped the top and poured a pretty cloudy slightly brownish yellow color with practically zero head after an aggressive pour . there is no lace whatsoever and the beer looks like brownish lemonade in my glass ... still and just ... . ( blech ! )	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a very deep , dark brown..entirely opaque . relatively thin brown head to start which recedes to a thin tan ring , and eventually disappears completely .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a cloudy straw color , does n't look really enticing , a little muddled . head is bright white and fluffy .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a light , cherry-soda red ( pink , really ) with a light red ( pink , really ) head .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : dissipating , bubbly head ... clear , pale golden color ... light carbonation ... kind of doa	0000000000000000000
1	a : poured a cherry juice red with a half finger pink head that left pretty good sticky lacing .	00000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear golden orange color . a small white head forms , and recedes in a second . light lace is left behind .	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours very dark brown , nearly black , producing a light brown head about 2 '' , which has good retention and leaves some lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours very black with a thick , billowy , light chocolate brown head that sticks around for a little bit .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy green-golden body boasting four fingers of head in a weizen glass . head dissipated very quickly and leaves no lacing .	000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : really nice dark gold , slightly hazy beer with lots of steady carbonation and a gorgeous whipped cream stark white head with great retention ... very attractive beer	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours black with a medium brown head with good retention and concentric full rings of lace .	0000000000000000000
0	a : pours a crystal clear light amber color with a slight head that fades quickly .	00000000000000000
1	appearance : golden with a smoggy haze . i 'm diggin ' the head .	000000000000000
0	a : pours a slightly hazy golden with some orange highlights , capped by two fingers of white head . retention ca n't even really be called poor , as the head almost immediately dissipates and does n't even leave any lacing in its wake .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pail yellow ; an inch head that quickly fades .	000000000000
0	a : this beer pours straw-colored with a large white sizzeling head . dissipation is fast and leaves only some lacings .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : orangy and light brown with not a lot of head , but an extremely long lasting lace , with remarkable bubbles along the rim . little carbonation . swirling to get aroma brings out a disappating foam .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured a very clear amber brown color with hints of burnt orange and a thin veil of white bubbly foam which left little lacing . an odd looking porter to say the least .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours pitch black with an almost no-exicting pale brown head that sets into no lacings .	000000000000000000
1	appearance : golden hue with a nice sticky lace	000000000
1	a : deep beautiful red . tiny white head that quickly fades . good .	000000000000000
0	appearance : dark brown , slight haze , a few bubbles but not really any head	0000000000000000
0	a : bazzam ! this beer does not like being kept under 4 degrees in the fridge - it came bursting out of the bottle like it had something to prove before the slightly tan head died down to nothing . body is a cloudy honey orange .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a two finger medium looking fluffy white head that makes a ton of noise . retains decently , but soon fades to a thin wisp with carbonation decorating the top . golden tangerine yellow in color , cloudy , with lots of carbonation evident . head quickly fades completely and leaves zero lacing down the glass . slightly disappointing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured a very thin white head . had an unfiltered golden color .	000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear golden color with off-white head and lots of lacing around glass . looks good .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : yet again my trusty duvel goblet fares well and proves to be the right choice . the body has a murky brown tinge at first , but on closer examination and strongly backlit it has a deep ruddy red body that glistens with a deep blackcurrant hue . a purple-pink head fizzes into life during the pour but quickly effervesces into nothing . flat appearance is not helped by the low levels of carbonation . average appearance .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured a 3 finger light brown fine head with great retention . brew itself is near opaque except for the slightest bit of light shining through . lacing is excellent with layers marking where i drank .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a huge ridiculous head ! it poured what i would call a cloudy amber .	00000000000000000
0	a : pours with a small , off-white head that is quickly diminishing . the body is very clear and medium-dark amber . spare lacing . not off to a great start here ...	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a raven black color with a huge tan head that has a degree of permanence to it ; sheets of lacing line the chalice	000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : avant peche appears dark brown in the glass , but does n't come too close to pitch black . dark ruby hints around edges . 2.5 fingers of light tan head forms that has great lacing and retention .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : the hazy honey-colored liquid arrives with a modest cap that disappears in a blink without leaving a trace behind	000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dark straw gold , light lacing , little carbonation- a little dark for a saison	00000000000000000
1	a : hazy golden yellow color . steady stream of carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass . three fingers of creamy frothy head clumps together as it falls and leaves tons of irregular lacing . great retention . a true work of art . 4.0	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a surprisingly dark burnt orange/brown with about 3 fingers off frothy off-white head . the head recedes quickly into a thin ring with no lacing . not very attractive for a hefeweizen , which ideally should have a solid head throughout .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours clear golden with a really large creamy head , that stays for a long time , leaving great lacings when it sets .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : apple cider or dark champagne gold and very clear . speaking of champagne , it has an insane amount of carbonation which keeps a half-a-finger nail of white head on top for a while . i must stress , this might be the most racing carbonation i have ever seen in a beer . it does not look like a fall pumpkin brew .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : looks like carbonated piss . very yellow with a half inch sparkling white head that disapears , not too quick leaving no lacing .	00000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : translucent and clean , absolutely no minuscule particles here . pale golden color with a thin white head which quickly completely disappears , very quickly . no lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : wow , thick is really thick . too much of a cliche to say it pours like motor oil ... but it does . not jet black but very dark and murky . very low carbonation , no real head to speak of ever . some stray swashes of foam decorate the top of the body and guard the sides of the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : brilliantly filtered , rich orange moving into shades of brown , off-white head with good retention .	0000000000000000000
1	a : it pours exceptionally beautiful . without the aid of light it seems to be a dark brown but when held to a lamp it really glows . a nice cherry , burgundy hue appears with the light shining through it .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : inky black and dark as night , as always .	000000000000
1	a : dark brown/gray , opaque with a thick beige head . some carbonation to the top	00000000000000000
0	appearance : not too pretty . hazy ( pectin haze ? ) . quickly dissipating head . straw colored beer .	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours into my victory becker black in color with a 3-finger high loose-bubbled light tan head . it drops to a thick surface coating never once showing the surface of the beer . lacing comes in sheets all the way down the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : nice slightly hazy gold with about 2-3 fingers of white , frothy head .	0000000000000000
1	a : it 's crystal clear with an orange hue and multiple lines of carbonation . the head is sizable , and very creamy . really it looks great ! the head lasts a long time , and there 's a lot of lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : hazy gold/orange with an obscene white head with really good retention .	00000000000000
0	a : pours a clean golden/amber with a half inch of head that dissipates quickly . moderate carbonation and spotty lacing . n : very good pumpkin aroma along with caramel and light spices ( mostly nutmeg . )	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : what a pretty beer ! poured into an over sized wine glass , a gorgeous cranberry color .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : very clear yellow with thin white head . belgian abbey styles do n't usually look this clear to me ...	0000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a funky orange-red-copper color . extremely active carbonation bursting out of the bottle into the glass causes a flash head . disappears with no lacing . left with an ugly colored beer and thats it .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : spot on . color was a perfect dark amber/reddish tan , head was low ( appropriate to style , but also possibly because it was served too cold -- this was the pub 's assumption that american 's want frozen beer ) .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : absolutely amazing in its appearance . almost neon-yellow in color , this is an opaque , cloudy beer . pours with a great head that leaves a thin lacing on the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : classic guinness : black body with ruby highlights and a waterfall of roiling nitrogenation . the creamy finger of foam stays around forever , creating an almost artificial-looking image of beauty . there 's just no use denying it : guinness is gorgeous .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured a medium light amber color with a one finger , off white head , nice lacing around the edges	0000000000000000000000
0	a : the beer is a light gold color with no head at all and no lace .	000000000000000000
0	a : pours a thin ( 1/8 '' ) dark tan/cocoa head of low density with little retention . espresso brown body , low light transmission . light coffee brown at the edges . not really a particularly attractive beer , nor entirely appropriate for the style ( head too dark and too weak ; body too light ) .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured into a wide snifter with decent head . dark and packed with unflocculated yeast .	000000000000000000
1	a : dark brown with 1.5 inch brown head that stays the whole time you drink it .	000000000000000000
1	appearance : 750 ml bottle that is corked and caged . orange golden color with a frothy white head and great retention .	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : color is light cherry red with a slight haze , though you can fairly easy see through the beer . with an easy pour the head forms a light foam of off-white with low but good retention . flavor : malt sweetness is most prevalant upfront with some candy sugars mixing in as well . the sweetness last but for a moment before a moderately strong alcohol spice kicks in . the alcohol carries the flavor through the middle but does allow those dark fruit notes to push through . finish is biting and dry with hop bitterness and more alcohol hitting you at the back of the throat .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured amber brown with ruby highlights that had no head on the top and no lacing sticking to the glass .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : nice blonde colour , head dissappeared almost immediately .	00000000000
1	appearance : 5 |	0000
1	a : looks both relatively and absolutely good . the color is full and light amber . there is even some lacing which is impressive in any light beer .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a brilliantly clear whiskey-brown , a creamy khaki-colored rocky head , lots of lace , small amount of granular yeast on the last pour	00000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very light golden color with some thin white foam ; with the yeast the beer became golden and cloudy .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : looks good , light lacing , nice head .	00000000000
1	a : without the benefit of light , this looks like a muddy , cinnamon-tinged cocoa ; held to light , it glows ruby , a bourbon-amber - really lovely ! one has to look closely , but the smallest carbonation flourishes here , rising to a creamy khaki lid that - no joke - lasts for over an hour . fragmented lace in fiery licks up the glass . possibly the prettiest bw i 've seen , and that 's saying something .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : i am in love with this beer 's appearance . the head is soft , creamy , and robust . it looks like it should be on a guinness . the color is light golden with nice carbonation and screams refreshing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : awfully clear for a witbier as it 's you can still see fairly concise blurs coming from the other end of the glass . the body boasts good carbonation , that is clearly visible through it 's brassy coloration . it started with a good finger of head , and it left very minor lace and did not retain well .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : no fuckin head , no matter how hard i tried . medium brown color , but looks watery . 3.5	0000000000000000000000
1	a : this beer pours a beatiful opaque black color that reminds me of ink , beatiful drinkable ink . so dark i ca n't see through this one . this stout pours a huge coffee colored head with alot of lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear amber with garnet tones in the glass . the beer is well-carbed , with a frothy 2 '' head filling my hair of the dog tulip . it retains surprisingly well , leaving thick , sticky lace down the sides of the glass as it goes .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : deep dark ruby ( yes irish stouts are actually ruby coloured - they just look black ) , poured a perfect 1.5cm white head that leaves rings to the glass as i drink - a perfect looking dry irish stout .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : nice true black/brown color that does n't let light through . it pours a robust tan head that maybe reduces to half an inch in size over time .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : amber/brown beer with a light head with great retention on top . impressive .	0000000000000000
0	appearance : poured with a pretty tan colored , fizzy head that dissipated fairly quickly leaving no lacing . the beer is pitch black and does n't let any light through at all .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : augusta saison pours a very hazy dark caramel color with straw colored highlights . about a finger of eggshell white head reduces down to slight lacing . seems a little dark colored for a saison .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : first off , love the bottle , it stood out on the shelf and is the reason i grabbed it in the first place . the pour is n't bad either ; light , copper brown in color with a big thick head that lasts for awhile . carbonation seems high , lots of bubbles rising .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured with a huge , frothy , fizzy white head that slowly diminished to 2-finger size . very good lacing left on the glass . body is a light orange color , and hazy . an excellent-looking beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : very frothy not a gusher but the carbonation was very active during the pour . the head retention was the best i have seen in a long time . the sediment stayed to the bottom the bottle to yield a semi-clear reddish orange hue .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured a coppery orange body , with a beautiful fluffy white head . nice suddy lacing .	0000000000000000000
0	a : again , when i held it up to the light , i saw a lot o f yeast ( i think it was yeast ) floating around and it did n't sink . smell and	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : i poured this into my samuel smith pint glass and what came out of the bottle was this really beautiful dark amber color with a hint of honey to it . it would have been nicer if the head of foam was just as good as the color . all i got was something like half an inch of white bubbly foam that dissipated away completely only after 30 seconds . of course that left no rings or even lace for that matter around the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a very light gold color and crystal clear . decent sized white head that dissipates quickly . there was good glass lacing though .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear , rich amber body . the head is a bit disappointing , rising to a finger and then vanishing pretty much entirely . no lacing , no collar ... . weird .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours an absolutely crystal clear reddish amber into a mug . the head is slightly off-white and massive . bubbles cascade up from the bottom constantly refreshing it , but eventually it falls to a significant surface coating . lacing exists in sporadic sheets .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : massive white head on a deep red body .	00000000000
1	a : dark . dark , three finger , espresso bubble colored head . thicker than most stouts .	0000000000000000000
0	a : nice amber , burnt orange color . a little bit hazy . head is off white , but not much retention . weak lacing .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pour is dark , almost all black but with some red hues . the tall creamy tan head sinks surprisingly quick and leaves ondly faint lacings .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this beer looks great it is almost fun to pour , it has a black color with a cream head that you could build a sculpture with .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a very pale golden color with little carbonation and lacing .	00000000000000
0	a : i 'm getting tired of figuring out how to say `` orange '' in a different way every time i review ales so i 'll just come out and say it has a slightly cloudy orange body . there was a white 1cm head which has dissipated to nothing ... looks like a cider .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a slightly hazy orange color , not too much head , very little lace down the glass	00000000000000000000
1	a : rich , off-white head with good persistence and lacing . amber in hue .	0000000000000000
0	appearance : deep copper with a slight haze . off white pours thick then fades quickly .	00000000000000000
0	a : the only thing that comes to mind when looking at the beers is : someone poured out 1/2 a bottle of corona extra , filled it up with 1/2 water , and slapped a `` light '' label on the bottle .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours like a pale ale with a light red hue . not very much white head , and it disappears leaving no lacing . boo .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : clear gold with a fast fading head .	0000000000
1	a : looks amazing , such a deep color that i would call blood orange with outstanding head retention and killer lacing . thats a 5 for look for sure .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : cloudy orange/yellow color . huge white head with some staying power .	00000000000000
0	appearance : pours with barely even an a centimeter of head , that obviously did not lace or retain . the body however boasts solid carbonation , a nice orange/bronze color and boasts decent carbonation . clearly unfiltered by it 's cloudy appearance but not riddled with sediment .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours dark brown but not quite black , capped by a two finger , rich brown head . retention is good for style/abv and a good deal of lacing is left on the glass . not sure how an imperial stout could really look any better .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark red with a full off-white head with great retention and mild lacing .	000000000000000000
0	a : absolutely clear golden color . minimal white head . looks like an american macro .	00000000000000000
1	appearance : hazy orange with a very active sticky head that laced the glass . took some patience for the head to die down to get the rest of the beer in the glass . flavor : mild taste with a firm hop/lemon aftertaste that seems to evaporate on the tongue . some cider notes in the aftertaste .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dark , opaque brown that is almost black . a small , bubbly tan head forms that recedes in a second . light lace .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : green ! 5 oz pour into a fw tasting snifter , hazy , white bubbly head , rose about a quarter of an inch , then settled to a ring of bubbles . high marks alone for the color , since there is very little to compare that too .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark brown with some light beige hues , a little too light for me for an imperial stout . a bubbly and thin off-white head dissipates rather quickly and does n't leave any impressive lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear , honey colored body with an overall reddish tone to it . absolutely no head , retention or lacing ( obviously ) whatsoever . fairly boring but somewhat acceptable for the style , although i 've had plenty of wild ales with some type of head .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : uh oh . where 's the yeast ? looks like this beer has been filtered . looks like a lager	0000000000000000000000
0	a : has a cloudy and golden look with a thin white head .	00000000000000
0	a : pours an off-white 1 finger coarse head that dissipates quickly . beer is a near opaque but clear , dark cherry color . lacing is spotty to non-existant .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy orange-yellow with a faint trace of head on top . would n't have enough head to lace if it tried .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a murky amber that glows a burnt orange against the light . an aggressive pour produces a flaccid pinky finger of off-white head that vanishes quickly , leaving only a streak or two of lace . hmm . i prefer clear beers with gorgeous , sticky lace . it 's fair to say this is below average on ipa appearance .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured from a bottle to a mug . had a light brown color and a completely thin consistency . almost no head or lacing to speak of .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear copper colour , nice head , loads of carbonation	000000000000
1	a : like dirty motor oil almost perfectly black with medium head with a nice brown color .	000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a dark brown that is fairly transparent featuring ruby red highlights and a 1/2 finger foamy off-white head . decent head retention with minimal lacing . not exactly what i expect an imperial stout to look like .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark orange copper body , with an off white head . its a little hazy throughout .	0000000000000000000
1	appearance : great looking beer : very dark ( almost black ) body topped with a large tan brown head that lasts very well and leaves superb lace .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a medium brown color . there is virtually no head at all .	0000000000000000
0	appearance : light pale , yellow . clear and fizzy with little head .	00000000000000
0	appearance : golden and translucent . bubbly and appeared like a pilsner , even miller lite . medium , white head that dissipated slowly .	0000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : as poured the beer is a hazed golden peach color with a 1 head that recedes slowly leaving large patches of foam clinging to the sides of the glass . the head persists well and sipping creates some leggy lacing that clings to the sides of the glass . for most of the beer the surface is covered by a layer of foam and there are leggy patterns of lacing clinging to the sides of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : into a pint glass , this beer pours a very pale golden color . when held to light , only the faintest hue of yellow can be observed . an active head of white rises to and soon settles to a thin lacing on the surface . carbonation is moderate to high , and remains active throughout . who knows if poland is being funny when they print o.k . beer on the cap . i found it humorous .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : peachy sunset brown with an utterly pathetic head that barely forms and then quickly runs away .	0000000000000000000
1	a : auburn red color , with a great creamy head . crazy head retention and lacing , so it looked lovely in the glass .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : copper in color , good clarity , with a dense , tan head that never really dissipates .	00000000000000000000
1	a : pours pitch black . a two finger tan head forms in my tulip glass . rings of sticky lace are left clinging to the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : dark copper color with a large off-white head that leaves behind pretty thick lace .	00000000000000000
0	a : pours a pale yellow with a fizzy two finger width head that fades quickly . no lacing .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : clear crisp golden color with a 1/2 inch thick dissipating white head . no lacing .	000000000000000000
0	a : brownish-red , like a dark brown ale . lots of ruby at the edges . head is virtually nil . foam ring after the fizzing stops .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : 8.4 ounce bottle brewed in ceres , ca ... interesting . i picked this one up bevmo in chino hills today for $ 4 something a bottle . the beer pours very thick . it looks like used motor oil . dark chocolate syrup brown . no head and no carbonation are observed . when looking at it like wine , it has nice legs . swirling brings no head . lots of sediment in chunks the size of sesame seeds .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : holy smokes ! this is by far the most unnatural color for a beer i 've ever seen . like others have said , the color is best described as `` grape soda '' . thin , half-finger head that quickly dissipates with very little lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a surface non-finger head , very thin and without cream . retention is nonexistent . the colour is a dark amber , certainly non-transparent . the beer is lively and appealing in spite of its poor head . sm : caramel , dark fruit esters . not detecting the roasted malts claimed by the label . it 's a strong scent .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours thick , syrupy & black . sturdy cappuccino head , that seems smaller than it should be .	000000000000000000000

0	appearance : urine .	0000
0	a : pours a clear golden color with a nice white head that fades to a large ring and leaves some lacing on the glass . should be cloudy but it 's clear as day .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear dark brown with light brown head . great retention that leaves some decent lacing around glass .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a hazy gold with no head whatsoever . displays a brilliant , shimmering golden hue with faint orange highlights when held up to the light . if this had a head , it would look great .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a slightly hazy orange-gold body capped by a little over two fingers of creamy off-white head that fades slowly and leaves excellent sheets of lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear , deep copper with a tight head . head disappears quickly . so far , this is n't looking too kolsch-like .	000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured dark honey amber color , with visible carbonation . two finger pillowy khaki head with very good retention . very nice lacing .	00000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : hazy yellow with a head that builds up and disappears in seconds . no lacing whatsoever .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a dark , deep brown . a little light comes through around the edges to show the burnt carmel color . the tiniest bit of tan head fades quickly to a few wisps . no carbonation clinging to the glass , no lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a bit syrupy and quite opaque . more solid-like particles poured out at the end . no head or carbonation whatsoever .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a pitch black with an beautiful inch thick head . the head looks like thick dense melted espresso ice-cream , and the texture is almost that . about a half inch of head float like a raft on top of the brew all the way down to the last sip leaving behind thick sheets of lacing that coat the whole glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : it has a nice fully black color to it . it has a nice dark tan head that dies down slowly and leaves nice lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured a dark brown with maroon highlights with a very thin khaki colored head and left very little lacing sticking to the glass .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : what the fuck ? ! ! ? ! is this beer ? this is lighter than most of the bmc lineup . lightly yellow tinted clear . one finger of frothy white head . the retention is actually pretty good and a good bit of lacing is left behind . 1.5	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : reasonably pretty beer , though the massive head with soap sized bubbles detracted from it a bit . way over-carbonated . i could barely pour it without developing a 3 inch head on it that refused to go away .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a very dark brown , but not black like some stouts i 've seen . no head or lacing , and frankly does n't look that thick .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear gold body under a gorgeous inch of creamy white foam that rises well above the rim of the glass . tons of ultra-fine bubbles rise through the beer to reinforce the epic ( for a half-pint , at least ) head . terrific .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : reddish , amber color . small head with no retention or lacing .	000000000000000
0	appearance : a dark brown pour makes a small , medium looking , beige head that quickly vanishes to a splotchy wisp and ring . black body and no carbonation evident . a slight ring remains with zero lacing at all . lacking for the style in this department .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a deep red , with a tan head	00000000000
0	appearance : pours a really cloudy amber color with an orange hue . there is a finger of fluffy white head that fades but leaves some nice lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dark dark brown , with an off-white head ; looks like a porter !	000000000000000000
0	appearance : this light , crystal clear beer poured into a pint glass , and left a decent , one finger head on top .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : light clear gold , constant bubbles , big white head .	0000000000000
1	a : copper penny red . what i found interesting was the head that started thin and ended in the same exact thinness . i mean , this thing went nowhere .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : free pour yields a two and a half inch fluffy offwhite head that dissipates very slowly and sticks all over the side of the glass . pours a translucent , orange-ish dark red and leaves streaks and walls of thick lacing . looks great .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : slightly chill hazed , slight bit of sediment made its way into the beer , but otherwise clear and dark , sort of cola-like with just as much head and just as lasting . sort of dissapointed with the look of this one so far .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : gentle pour yields 1/2 finger of creamy cream colored head with good retention . slightly hazy amber copper color . good lookin ' .	00000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : an amber colored body with a loose thin head that recedes just before i finish the beer . the retention is n't terrible , it just does n't last long enough .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : light copper color , thick initial head , dissipates in a fair amount of time , nice lacing .	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : dark amber in color , lots of head , good retention .	00000000000000
0	a : no head at all . a clear yellow colour . sm : fresh barley and orange esters . a moderate strength aroma .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a hazy light orange color with some amber hues . provides a loose off-white foam head with moderate retention . provides ample amounts of lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a murky brown with no head whatsoever . bubbles bluff like they might stick around but disappear quickly .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : dark orange/burnt red with a 2 finger white head . lacing is left as the beer is consumed .	000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a dark , opaque brown color with a 1/2 '' tan head . it is short-lived and leaves barely and lace behind .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured a high clarity amber . quickly receding head , but decent lace ring around the glass .	00000000000000000000
0	a : murky , dull orange body that is n't particularly pretty . head is very white and gets up to two fingers , but recedes within the minute , leaving behind scant lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hmm , looks like a primary fermenter on day 5 . more particulate action than i wanted . hazy orange hue - 1.5 finger head - lacy	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : the pour was an almost artificial looking reddish-amber . like a cherry or raspberry syrup , almost . head retention is poor , as is lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a mountain of spongy and porous froth fills the glass with a fizz . a clear , bright golden hue . it 's gon na take a while before i can drink this . tons of sustain and lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours dark and thick , like black syrup . has a great brown two-finger head which lasts for a minute or two and leaves some nice lacing behind .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : this hefe was off to a bad start . the beer had a yellow lemonish color that was n't as cloudy or heavy looking as most of the good hefes i 've tried in the past . nice looking two finger white head but it dissipated really quick , boo . some lacing was present .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : light yellow	0000
0	appearance : pours into a shaker pint glass a clear ruddy gold . a head forms initially but drops instantaneously leaving barely a trace of itself . disappointing .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark red , with a thick , full , frothy white head , great retention , leaving medium lacing .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : huge 3+ finger creamy head . a murky red/brown color , almost cider like . leaves a thick , lined lacing	00000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a golden orange with a fizzy average white head .	0000000000000
0	appearance : served in a tulip glass , which i guess is closest to the thistle glass wee heavy is supposed to be served in . pours a very deep brown that allows barely any light to shine through . head is almost nonexistant even after a relatively hard pour , but can build to a quickly dissipating one finger that is off-white .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a pale golden color with minimal head ... nothing special	000000000000
1	appearance : poured in a pint glass it showed a completely translucent amber with a good half finger of tight froth which lasts and left a solid curtain of lace . looks just great , but the excessive clarity is a bit unnerving . flavor : subtle . a gentle dark malt characteristic which ( i swear to god im not kidding ) reminded me of cask ale from england , but lacking the complexity and mouthfeel entirely . there is also a yeasty quality that surprised me at first , but the taste is lost quickly in the glass . hard to give a good description , theres so little here , but whats here is pretty good ! the maltiness just comes through , but very little actual sweetness , which is the only indication of hops .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : first of all the head on this beer is simply amazing . the head does not even want to recede ! the beer itself pours a rich brown color and billions of tiny bubbles rise to the top . as expected from a head this powerful , it laces the glass and does n't go away .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : nice purple label with a golden thumbprint . pours with very little head ; dissipates quickly . color of deep golden straw . not too clear .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : straw yellow , clear and surprisingly nice lacing	0000000000
1	a : dark brown/red with some lasting carbonation .	000000000
1	appearance : heavy red-orange brown color , clear with significant carbonation , moderate foaming with clean pour , with only resdiual foam lingering around the rim .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark brown and muddy . zero head or lacing .	000000000000
0	a : poured into a tall glass , had a nice golden color and a fluffy , but rapidly vanishing head . the head and slick completely disapears after about 2-3 minutes , leaving just a golden drink that looks like cultured apple juice with a few bubbles in it .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a golden translucent color . the fizzy white head dissipates almost immediately leaving no lacing .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : black , no head , no carbonation	000000000
0	a : lame straw yellow .	000000
1	appearance : a beautiful looking beer , one that invites a drink . nice cloudy golden color ; liquid sunshine . a really nice thick head with fragile brewer 's lace ringing the inside of my pilsner glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : hazy orange copper glass that poured with a very enthusiastic head ( all foam actually ) that stayed and started to dry before fading , leaving clumpy lace . flavor : same worty under-attenuated sweetness with a overly firm hop that gives an acid burn . the underlying taste is fairly nice with some orange blossom and honey notes , but there isnt enough hop flavor to balance all the hop burn .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pale straw color . poured a 1 finger stark white head that dissipated quickly to a broken skim . decanted lightly . laced in inconsistent thin rings .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a rich golden color , somewhat hazy . truly lovely when held to light . two fingers of soapy white head . lacing is a mixture of streaks and spots around the glass . film fully covers the beer . this is how a beer should look .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a cloudy golden orange with a very small ivory colored head . it is short-lived and leaves no lace on the glass . swirling creates some spotty lace .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : lightly hazy , this beer poured a light amber-orange color . it sometimes appeared a muted golden yellow . the white head was coarse and behaved like it belonged to a soda . it was very fizzy and dissipated in the blink of an eye , leaving only the few bubbles that appeared on the surface due to the sustained bead . there was no lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : murky brown body with a few centimeters of head and no lacing .	000000000000000
0	a : pours orange brown with a slight offwhite head , about 1 finger , that dissipates fairly quickly . noticeably murky and appears that it may be bottle conditioned , but can not determine this as i did not see a layer of yeast at the bottom ( perhaps i poured it all into the beer ? ) .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a slightly cloudy dark brown/copper color with an inch and a half of fluffy , foamy head . a fairly large amount of carbonation is evident . gobs of head on this one ! the lacing just goes on and on and on . amazing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : large 3 finger head , khaki colored , foamy/fluffy and long lasting . the body is orange-amber and lightly hazy at first . clarity improves after warming . tattered half sheets of lacing from the head with even better coverage from the body .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : black as night , thick head , motor oil , this makes guiness sorta look more porterish than stout-porterish . surprising . thick brown head that goes to a decent foam with good lacage .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dark red brown . very light colour for a porter , looks like a dunkel . mild off-white head .	000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very dark , black look . when held up to a light , there is a beam of amber shining through the black void of this beer , and you can see some yeast floating around .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a turbid autumnal ruddy orange with limited ethereal head production . a translucent sheet of taupe foam remains . spotty lace .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : black with ruby hues , not a lot of head , but a thick cream collar forms .	00000000000000000000
1	a : perfectly clear light amber body with an inch of creamy white foam . pretty good retention and lacing . lovely .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : a bit dark for a barleywine . pours like a nut brown . the head is soda-like and fades quickly , leaving no bubbles . there are legit legs in the glass , however .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a murky brown with no head , just a smattering of ochre bubbles .	00000000000000000
0	a : light pale yellow with a head that dissipated in seconds	000000000000
0	a : the cork came out with barley a pop and the beer pours a flat deep brown with maybe 3 or 4 bubbles of head that left a few dots of lacing down the glass . highly unimpressive .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : crystal clear golden yellow , no head , pretty fizzy	000000000000
1	appearance : the beer has a dark amber coloration . the head is thick creamy off white coloration . there is some nice staying power with the head . there is thick lacing going down the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : there is nothing quite like a properly served guinness for appearance . it consists of a black body and cream mocha head separated by a cascading mixture of the two .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : nothing short of beauty . great `` mahogany '' color , carbonation bubbles as much as the eye can count . great 2 finger head , exceptionally pretty . expectations are high .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a clear pale golden hue with a ( surprising ) three-finger head ! it 's soapy white and actually leaves lacing down the glass ! whoa !	000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : golden with a slight haze and a massive stream of carbonation rising from the bottom and all sides of the glass . the head filled up the entire upper 3 inches of my tulip , leaving behind thick sheets of lace as it slowly settled into an thick and dense half-inch head .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : largest , most fluffy , sticky head i 've ever seen . absolutely amazing . sticks around for ever . murky brown color . great lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : rich clear gold . big fluffy white head that sticks around for a while . large carbonation bubbles streak to the surface . a beautiful looking beer , but not your typical shade for an oud bruin .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pale , clear yellow , just struggling for some color to distinguish it from water .	000000000000000000
0	a : reddish , cloudy , with little head that went away quickly .	00000000000000
1	a : it had to be poured out extremely slowly so i was already anticipating some over the top carbonation . once it was finally in the glass , it was quite dark with a one finger light tan head .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : slightly hazy brown beer . barely any highlights of other colors shine through . minimal head that is slightly off white in color . big bubbles sit atop the head .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a hazy orange/lightbrown color with a light brown head	00000000000
1	appearance : the first that struck me was the bright , deep golden color . nice full coarse head that did n't disapate until the last few drinks .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : very dark body , thick mocha head . very carbonated .	0000000000000
1	appearance : nice . a clear golden straw-like color . nice foamy head which hangs around for a while and some nice lacing left over . nice , as if i did n't use that word enough .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : extreme cream coloured head that is easily over 3 '' . leaves a lacing comparable to , if not better than , duvel . the liquid is a cloudy amber colour with white chunks floating throughout . i would dive right in , but i have to wait for the head to settle .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pouring a stunning deep amber with a massive head of a few inches that is very frothy . the head is like when sugar and water come to a boil remarkable . it has a very thick lacing to it .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : opaque black bodied beer with a khaki/tan head . head is about one and a half fingers high . receeds into heavy lacing on side of glass .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a nice golden hue with a crazy overdone foamy mess of a white head . it takes forever to pour a pint but does leave mass amounts of lace . brewers need to get these heads under control as they are a pain in the ass negative points for that .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : ruby red , pink head , nice lace .	00000000000

0	a : cloudy brown body topped with a small creamy head that quickly dissipates leaving no lacing and a thin creamy cover .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : a slightly hazed bright rich golden hue . not much head on this body . starts with a one finger head , down to a rim pretty quick . some lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a golden brown with orange highlights . the head is 1.5 '' tall , white , with good retention . lots of lace that allows no window space .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark brick read color , almost brown . a two finger beige head forms with good retention . the foam gently recedes to leaves some patchy lace that crawls along the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : see above . jet black pour with a huge tan foamy head . flavor : spicy yeast driven esters with some cinnamon and clove background notes . moderate warming alcohol . a bit of background roastiness ( i think ? ) that gets washed over by the yeast driven spiciness . background earthy hop flavors layer under the yeasty character . finish is clean and dry .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a nice frothy head , lots of bubbles but not much head retention after things settle and minimal lacing on the glass .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : rich amber color ; produced a foamy head that was at first impressive , but did n't last too long . no lacing to speak of .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this was a very pretty , dark , coppery garnett color . it poured with a fizzy , short lived , faintly pink head .	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : very dark and very nice to look at 2 finger light brown head that goes down to a nice sheen and pretty collar . the lacing is almost solid up and down the glass very nice to look at .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours with just shy of two fingers of light tan head . this settles slowly , leaving behind great lacing , and eventually falling to a thin coating of foam . the beer itself is a muddy brown , with slight reddish hints . essentially opaque . fair amount of sediment in the bottle .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : maple syrup brown . totally transparent . no carbonation . great big tan head , solid lacing . n : lightly roasted malts , sweet grains , a touch of caramel .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a hazy golden color . head fizzes away almost instantly and there is no lacing to speak of .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : pale in color , almost clear in the stream coming from the bottle . the head is fizzy and dissipates almost instantly . pretty standard so far .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : lacing didnt quit on this one . amber color with a puffy meringue head- high grades here because this is a picturesque esb . n : fresh bakery aroma and biscuity . mild hops and malt as it warmed some .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear straw body ; one finger of reasonably creamy white foam . pretty good retention and lacing . nice looking euro lager .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : deep burnt orange , pours a 1/2 inch head with great retention and leaves some lovely lace behind .	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a bright gold color , slightly hazy , with a thin sticky lace . it has those dollops that i love to see in the lace .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : crystal clear golden pale yellow hue . gigantic stark white head rises quickly to the top of my glass . it 's actually thick enough that as i finish pouring it stayed on a 45 degree angle while setting up . after falling it leaves a tiny amount of soapy lace and a thin cap .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : wow.. it looked a little flat so i poured aggressively and the reddest , black-cheery massive frothy head took over the glass and after 5 minutes of sitting has only died down a tad . what a monster looking beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : much darker than i was expecting from a `` brown ale , '' more like a porter . a little dark mahogany can be seen on the edges when held up to a bright light . even a fairly aggressive pour failed to produce even a full-finger of head , and what i did get dissipated quickly .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : streams of carbonation rise to the top of the beer , a gigantic stark white head , slow fades , with big bubbles .	00000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a thin white head that has no retention . the color of the beer is a medium gold color , with copper hues . the clarity of the beer is clear to brilliant . there is effervescence in the beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a muddy amber color with hints of yellow . head literally fizzles like soda pop and disappears almost completely ( like soda pop ) .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : surprisingly light and golden for a beer of this strength . would probably score this a 3 were it not for the floaters .	00000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pellucid dark sunburst copper red body sits quietly underneath an off-white head rises and stays stiff and firm . head soon relaxes though and rests at thick . the tan colored head has a rustic charm .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : neon orange-rose , made all the more striking by how clear it is . thin head that dissipates quickly but leaves some legs .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a nice looking dark red color with a cream colored head that stays for a pretty long time . also leaves excellent lacing on the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very hazy and only a small head . rusty orange . not very inspiring .	00000000000000000
0	appearance : pours muddy rusty hazed almost black no head .	00000000000
0	appearance : a one finger foamy creamy white head that has very poor retention . the color of the beer is a dark straw color with brown hues . the clarity of the beer is clear with some haziness . there is some carbonation in the beer , i hope that is a good sign .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : it looks like bud concentrate - basically is looks even more like piss . it also looks like the piss of someone who is dehydrated . the head looks like piss of someone who ate a lot of protein .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark coppery body with three fingers of white fully head . retention is amazing and leaves loads of lacing .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : a super muddy brown hue . opaque . bubbly head definitely has hints of brown in it . virtually no lacing , but i can definitely see some legs down the sides of my glass . first time in a while for that . besides the legs , not the most inviting looking brew .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very light straw color , which looks like solid yellow that has been watered down . the pour left a bit of head that succeeded in capping the beer , though promptly disappeared . looking at the beer , i could see numerous bubbles marching towards what used to be the head .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : really dig the look here . mildly aggresive pour yields a two finger light brown head that is extremely persistent . dark brown/black body that is opaque but for the rim .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : golden yellow with a light almost khaki tone . white short-lived head .	000000000000000
1	a : pours a golden orange with a white sticky head that leaves behind beautiful lacing . very clear with visible carbonation .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : bright , shiny blood red , white head , nice lacing , neat small glass	00000000000000000
0	a : the color is black with ruby red highlights one the bottom of the glass . it could be seen , in better light i suppose , as a deep brown . the brown head does not stay very well at all and eventually dissolves to nothing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : orangy amber with 2 finger white head and medium carbonation	000000000000
0	a : bright yellow with a hint of orange . a small half finger head quickly dissipated to nothing . it seemed a bit under carbonated .	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear , golden body capped with 4-5 fingers of off-white head that completely fills the glass off of a small pour . the dense bubbles recede evenly , leaving streaks of lace down the glass as they go .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : tight , creamy , off-white/tan head . the beer is incredibly dark , and completely opaque . i feel comfortable calling it black ; it 's close enough to not make a difference . head has good retention and leaves behind a tantalising lace .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : hazy orange-amber body with a solid cap of fine tan foam . nice .	0000000000000000
1	appearance : stone pale ale pours an amber copper color , slightly hazy . by far the most appealing part of the appearance is the tall , pillowy , sexy off-white head . tons of sticky lace and carbonation visibly replenishes the head from the bottom .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a completely opaque deep and dark , black with some brownish hues along the edges of the glass . there is no carbonation to speak of , ergo no head formation at all .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : well it is a lucid gold with a large white head that has good staying power . it looks great and has a very pale lager feel about it sadly its macro looks follow through in the rest of the experience .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : deep brown showing ruby amber with backlight . tan head collapsed pretty quickly into a clumpy cover . thin globs try to cling to the side , but fall back to the beer pretty quickly . flavor : starting cold , it comes across as a dark amber ale . the roasted barley characters take the lead , but as it warms more flavors start to show up . a light white grape aftertaste gives a nice counterpoint to the darker flavor , and a lightly sugared roasted wheat flavor settles in after a few drinks .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours black with an insane amount of tan head . it has been 10 min and i still can not actually drink the beer . 5 fingers of head . no matter how carefully i poured the head would just explode .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a poor foamy and bubbly white that has very poor retention . the color of the beer is a pale orange color with light orange tan hues . . the clarity of the beer is hazy , cloudy , and yeasty . the head left no lacing on the glass , a very poor showing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a one finger head of bad thickness , not much cream , and decent retention . colour is a semitransparent orange-gold . sm : moderately heavy malts , light pleasant hops , clean barley , and maybe a biteen cream . a moderate strength aroma .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark ruby in color . crystal clear with a light tan fluffy head . truly a beautiful looking beer .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : looks like crap .	000000
0	a : pours reddish brown . i had a hard time squeezing a lot of head out of it and it dissipated fast with almost no lacing on the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a reddish brown . little head , leaves lacing and edging . very nice carb levels .	00000000000000000000
1	a : classic nitro tap look in a much lighter beer than is normally served in a nitro tap . starts out a cloudy cream-yellow color which settles to a very clear and clean beer with a nice thick head that never goes away .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : it poued a dark brown with redish tint around the edges body . however , when back lit the body became a deep red with a monster amount of bubbles rising from the bottom to the top . the head was a sticky two finger dense concoction that lingered and lingered .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours an unappealing yellow a shade darker than most adjunct lagers with a really pitiful white head that dissipates entirely in around 20 seconds . for a beer that depends so heavily on marketing , this was nothing short of pathetic .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : well ... the first thing that i noticed was the absence of any carbonation . i contacted the brewery and they indicted that the beer should have some carbonation , but ultimately i could not get the beer to produce a head . this was very much not what i expected at all . aside from that the body of the beer was a thick dark black .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : dark brown with virtually no head and lacing .	00000000000
0	appearance : espresso brown with just a tinge of brown highlights on the edge ; a thin layer of foam appears ( a good sign ) and some of it sticks to the glass	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : thin , pale yellow , very fizzy but no head	000000000000
1	a : the beer is a pure , if slightly pale , gold color with faint traces of carbonation inside . head was huge for some reason and was surprisingly long lasting . looks like an ideal pale lager should .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pale yellow with a slim white head , very light in colour for an all malt beer and the head retention lacks .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : i could n't give this appearance a 1.0 , because there almost is no appearance . there are lots of bubbles , no head , and only the palest *hint* of yellow amidst this clear concotion . i am not exaggerating , when pouring from the bottle , it was crystal clear , gaining its ghostly hue only in the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : boring pale yellow with no foam or carbonation .	00000000000
0	a : pours a dark orange amber with a mammoth , four-finger head that fills half the tulip glass and detracts from the presentation . out-of-control froth leaves patches of sticky lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : golden yellow , with slightly orange ambition . not a lot of head on my pour , slight lacing . nothing too noteworthy here .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : honestly , it does n't look like much . a dull golden colour with a few bubbles drifting to the top . almost two fingers of head which dissipated quickly .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pale straw color . poured a thin white head that dissipated to a few random bubbles . decanted lightly . no lacing .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : no head ; no lacing ; carb action only ok	000000000000
1	a : popped the cage and cork after sitting in my fridge for about 30 minutes . pours a clear dark caramel and rests in the glass a super , dark mahogany . massive head in my tulip glass that hangs around for a good while .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours a clear reddish purple color with a thick and fluffy 3 '' + pinkish white head that lasted a while . this is one interesting looking beer imho .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a hazy amber color with a thick off white head . there is lots of sediment suspended in the beer , even though the bottle has been undisturbed for a few days .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a highly carbonated mahogany ; huge , cocoa-brown head ; c-cup 's worth of lace ; excellent head retention .	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a transparent gold color with orange hues . the head really rises up to about 1.5 inches and is off white in color . plenty of stringy lace drapes on the sides of the glass . nice .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : light amber in color . appears to have rather low carbonation . thin white head that disappears rather quickly . leaves a think rim on the top of the beer , but not much else . not the best appearance .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a little darker than i would think . darker than straw yellow . the head was huge . i filled less than half the glass with the beer and the head was over-flowing . a head lasted the whole time and left distinct rings of lacing around the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : a nice copper color , i kind of liked it as it was a little darker than what i would have expected . very little cloudiness to it and it also had a very little head , perhaps 1 finger that dwindled quickly . left a very thin lacing here and there on the glass as it went down .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a one finger head of slight cream , nice thickness , and terrible twenty second retention . semitransparent copper colour . sm : light strength scent of pleasant berry esters , brewer 's sugar , and pleasant amber hops . very fresh and appealing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a relatively clear copper , with small head that leaves little lacing .	0000000000000000

0	a : pours black with a mild tan head . fair retention , no lace .	0000000000000000
0	a : clear pale amber body with a few weird worm-like chunks . one finger of frothy white foam . mediocre retention , no lace . i 'm not going to lie , it 's kind of gross looking - are those sea monkeys ?	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear dark russet in colour , coming with a fluffy light-khaki head , on top of low fizziness .	000000000000000000000
0	appearance : medium gold beer with stark white cap which soon fades to almost nothing	000000000000000
0	a : the first thing i noticed is that it has no head to speak of . i get a very small head but it goes away instantly . the beer is a dark orange-brown color and is very hazy . i do see carbonation .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : slightly orangy gold , almost no head , no rising carbonation .	00000000000000

1	appearance : 12 ounce bottle pours a very dark brown to black with slight amber hues . the head is thick like a a milkshake and mocha in color . nice lacing as the head reduces . aromas : stong hints of malts as well of honey . hints of chocolate malts and dark roasted coffee .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : hazy straw color with a tiny ring of bubbles around the top .	000000000000000
0	a : black , black , black ; surprisingly , not much head ; lacing after the drink was spotty	00000000000000000000
0	a : the beer is golden yellow with lots of sediment suspended throughout . it also has lots of head , but it dies off quickly .	000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : amber , nice head volume and retention .	0000000000
0	a : chunks in every pour . this beer pours a hazy , dirty , shit colored brown with tons of floating chunks of what i can only imagine is dirty beaver juice . not much of a head but some soapy lacing was left down the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a golden yellow with a frothy white head . it has lots of small pieces of debris floating in it .	000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : after a gusher of an opening , the beer settled down and pours a jet black color with nary a highlight ; nice frothy mocha head that leaves massive amounts of lace	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark -- like winter-night-in-siberia dark . head is full , a finger or so , and the lacing is prominent but short-lived .	0000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : poured a lovely amber black ( it makes sense ) with a lucious creamy 2 finger head . ample lacing made it a very lovely looking beer	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : aggressive `` pffft '' when opened . 2 fingers of head from a gentle pour , great retention of off-white foam . hazy reddish amber liquid . good looking !	00000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : it poured a slightly hazy orange first , brown second color . quite pretty . after 30 minutes in the glass as i drank , it cleared up quite a bit . i did n't get much head on the pour , but it was very effervescent , as indicated by the clarity that developed over the course of my consumption .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : very thick and creamy head with a huge and very long lasting amber brown in color and gloriously unfiltered .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : hazy gold color , tan head about half an inch or so thick , with excellent lacing , pretty fair head retention . quite cloudy .	0000000000000000000000000000

1	a : bright reddish-amber body under an inch of creamy tan foam . strong retention and layers of lace . gorgeous barleywine .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : i find it hard to believe that this is a wheat beer . it pours a clear straw yellow topped by a bubbly white head which quickly dies away to nothing . there is very little carbonation visible . i think that the filtered , headless beer was unappealing , considering that it was a wheat beer . i understand that three floyds does n't even want to fit into the style , but even when i try to disregard the fact that i am drinking a wheat beer , i still think it looks bad .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : pours from the bottle with a dark black body which , when held to the light , has deep claret like ruby hints . tan colored thickish head was moderate at first , but once in the glass it quickly relaxed , faster than a sphincter on laxative , to a rather poor looking thin covering , which eventually finished up as just a brown halo around the edges of the glass . had a decent level of carbonation though , surprising given the lax appearance . still , not that inviting to the eyes to be honest .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a deep , ruby red in color , very interesting , head size was generous and actually a pink color . lacing and retention were good all around .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : maybe i need to get a new glass to put this beer in because i can never get my beer to look like the ones in the pictures . yes this beer does manage a half inch thick of tightly packed head that fades in about a minute into a cap and leaves sparse lacing for a belgian beer . good color on this , dark clear cola , a cherry wood varnish until the yeast is added .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a dark black color into the pint glass . when held to the light a little bit of dark red can be seen . decent tan head ( about 1/2-inch ) faded to fairly thick covering on the liquid which lasted to the end . good lacing to the finish .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a rich dark goldn color with a good head and good lacing . a good looking bier .	000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a dark caramel amber . small frizzy white head .	0000000000000
1	a : pours very golden for an ipa , very clear with just a slight tinge of copper , new penny copper . good amount of carbonation , small bubbles , champagne-like in nature . billowy two finger head i just-off white . fairly pronounced lacing throughout .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : light yellow , crystal clear with a moderate white head . lots of carbonation ripping up . a few splotches of lace here and there .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured a murky brown with burgundy highlights , low carbonation , tannosh head that did not stick around , no lacing	00000000000000000000000
1	a : into the weizen glass it had a two almost three finger white head . into the pint it was only a two finger head . pour color was orangish yellow and cloudy .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours deep black with a generous two finger mocha head . head looks a bit foamy with very good retention and really good lacing .	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a great looking golden color with a half finger head . looks almost commercial .	000000000000000000
0	a : a slow , steady , high pour results in a thick black body underneath a mere half inch of frothy light-brown head . mediocre retention , spotty lace . not terrible , but pretty darn average .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a hazy straw yellow body . white fluffy head that quickly recedes to nothing . no lacing .	000000000000000000000
1	a : pours thick and black as night with a quarter inch of tan head . the head slowly dissipates into a gentle , lingering , tan froth . nice tan lacing up the glass with each swirl and sip . this is what an imperial stout should look like .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : nice big white head . very pale straw color . crystal clear .	000000000000000
0	a : golden orange and bronze colored body with a small , thick and bubbly white head . dissipation is extremely rapid and in the end , does n't leave any lace or retention . unfortunate but it 's just not the most attractive looking beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : woah dude , this looks amazing ! deep amber brown with a ridiculous huge frothy head . tons of lacing and fluffy multi layered goodness on top .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured much darker than then the regular papier ... a mix of brown and black , but again ... no head or lacing . if held up to the light , you get a tint of red piercing the outer edges of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured a cloudy , well , golden color with a substantial orange tint to it . the bartender poured it to the line in the golden monkey snifter , which looked pathetic because it had only the slightest ring of foam swirls ( leaving the headspace mostly empty ) . retention was mostly in the donut , which did n't leave any lacing . kind of a flaccid look for a tripel .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours orange ( like slice ) with high carbonatin and about 1 finger of white head . there is very pour head retention .	00000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a pale off yellow with a slight off tint probably due to the lime . barely any head and no lacing what so ever . also seems to have a clear problem with excessive carbonation . certainly some leeway is given because it is a light lager , however it 's pretty much an off color bud light , which is expected .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a nice reddish amber color ; sometimes this beer pours with a okay-looking head of bigger bubbles but sometimes pours a very thin head ( both seem to fizzle out fairly quickly though ) . a little bit of lacing . a fair amount of carbonation bubbles coming from the bottom of the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured from a 12 oz . bottle into a pint glass . abundant white foamy head . color is a mildly hazy , golden yellow . long retention and very good lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : straight pour into a pint glass . the color is black , but light was able to pass through when i held it to my lamp . two fingers of tan head developed and dissipated to leave a spotted lacing , trails long the glass , and a ring around the edge .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this was a dark brew that revealed itself as being a very deep crimson hue when held up to the light . a dense , tan head rose up easily and settled down slowly , leaving behind some foam on the side of the glass as it did so . as i downed the beer , there was a ton of lacing left , sometimes in the form of those wonderful foam rings that i love to see .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a clear golden colors with a tiny head that turns to lacing and a medium amount of carbonation .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : looks light . very little carbonation , considering i 've had hitachino nests that bubbled over before it was even poured . airy carbonation that sticks to the side of the glass , but little to no head on top .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours reddish brown with two fingers of foam with large soap bubbles . outstanding head retention .	0000000000000000000
0	a : a lightish brown with little head .	000000000
0	a : really clear copper looking ipa . hardly any head at all . bummer , was hoping for more on the appeareance . sticky lacing .	000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : typical hazy orange with massive white cap . retention is outstanding .	00000000000000
0	appearance : orange color with medium head and lace combined with very little carbonation .	000000000000000
1	a : pours a translucent amber with coppery highlights against the light . the head is 3 fingers of fluffy cream colored foam that collapses over several minutes into a dense half-finger cap on the brew , leaving substantial lacing in its wake . each sip coats the glass with sheets of lacing and register marks . even to the end of the drink there is a substantial cap .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours with a clear orange copper color with a fiant white fluffy head	000000000000000
0	appearance : the beer poured a good looking blackness with a cola colored head . no lacing in evidence . this is the high point of the beer .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : gorgeous mahogany red-brown , dark but with a good deal of clarity . short , tan head followed by strong lacing .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : this is one good looking stout , from the deep black body to the deeper khaki fruit infused head . great head retention and very creamy . lacing is left in layers and is very sticky .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dull gold and hazy , and light toward the top ; hazy enough that i cant see my fingers on the other side of the glass . pours a thin , rocky head that fades fast , with very little lacing , though the carbonation is certainly there .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured a hazy orange color with lacking carbonation leaving a small white cap	000000000000000
1	a : pours a vibrant chestnut ruby , with a good 1.5 '' light tan head that promises some retention . the hop cone restricted the flow while pouring it into the glass , which made it take quite a bit longer than usual . very nice touch though . nice lacing as it moves down the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : a beautiful beer ; pours a crystal clear golden-amber color with a finger of foamy white head . most of the head stays for the full glass , there 's tons of lacing , and carbonation bubbles never stop flowing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : black in color . head is thick , long lasting and light tan in color .	000000000000000000
1	a : truly abyss like - darkness envelopes my glass ! two fingers of tan head sit atop the blackness and eventually fade away to about one finger .	00000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : pours up with a nice finger and a half of tan foam that resists annihilation from the elements as long as possible . color is a deep amber . things are starting off right . however , it was impossible to get past the beta fish sized floaters that appeared to group together like schools of bait fish , roaming about their new 12oz clear sided world . very unattractive .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dull yellowish brown ; not much carbonation ( perhaps expected in a beer normally casked )	000000000000000000
1	a : vigorous pour leads to a tar black body with a creamy off white head that lasts as it warms down some . filmy , chunky lacing behind it , like skeleton hands . awesome looking beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : one of the prettier out there , pure eye candy . first pour into the oversized wine glass resulted in a huge offwhite head that lingers , lingers , lingers ... as this translucent amber brown brew goes down the hatch , there is lots of lacing . wow .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : copper . hazy . head is bright-white . small head . thin ring at edges for the duration . carbonation looks lo be on point . if this really is a dubbel , it 's definitely missing some of the deeper/darker colors .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a transparent garnet brown beer is active with carbonation and fervent with head foundation . the head is khaki and shows great retention and 4 '' of size . cakey surface and lots of spotty lace . the head still has n't relented after finishing the entire beer so i will have to wait to get the last gulp .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : i drink this beer quite regularly and one thing that always stands out is the lacing . it is some of the nicest you will witness . in fact the appearance of the beer in general is very nice with a pale orange honey color and the head always pours a 2 finger head . when the head recedes there 's nice pillowy puffs of foam that remain until the end .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours out a crystalline , golden-amber body with a modestly-sized , white head .	0000000000000000
1	appearance : moldy-reckoning ; deep mahogany colours , and an ample juxtaposition -- the head was slighted , but came fulfilled thorough and clean . a heavy wait . the head bubbled to the top , presenting much foam , until a good 4-minute calibration and it was no more . from afar , looks a bit like a samuel adams ' utopias ... definitively a massive drink . and definitely worthy of many hand-held praise ... even if for a moment .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : into a pint glass , the 12 oz bottle poured a coppery-amber with a 1.5-finger bubbly khaki head . lots of carbonation as tiny bubbles rush to the surface to fortify the head , allowing it to linger nicely . some lacing as i drink it , and some sediment settles to the bottom of the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : uh no foam , bad sign for a belgian . the carbination just does n't look `` right . '' looks more like an amber than a dark beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours black , not fully opaque . aggressive pour does not give a head at all .	0000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured with a solid two thumbs of head that retained and laced like crazy . the beer itself is a cloudy dark yellow , just as you would expect to be with great signs of carbonation . nothing to complain about here .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : straw color , fair amount of haze , crisp and inviting , head not as billowous as i 'd like , poor retention ( pretty much disappears altogether )	0000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : brilliant clear golden-orange ; no yeast . plenty of effervescent carbonation supports good head retention and truly exceptional lacing .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : an amateur pour captured the yeast slug in this beer , producing a cloudy amber body that glows slightly reddish against the light . the head is surprisingly flaccid for a beer that contains brett ; it 's half a finger at best , with short retention , no lacing , and a very thin collar .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : huge , huge , huge foamy head 50cm ! as if i pee 'd on a bar of soap , how did this happen ? apart from that the beer has a really nice glow to it 's murky not yet ripe orange body . the highlights on the beer are even lighter when looking through this duvel glass . dare i say it 's a really pretty looking beer ?	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : out of the nitro can/bottle , the surge . that 's all that you need to say -- it 's a sight to behold and it 's almost the authentic pub experience . when pouring this brew , billions of nitrogen bubbles rush to the bottom of the glass and then settle . once you finish the very important two part pour ( i stress this , as this is the proper way to have a pint of guinness ) a beautiful , creamy off white head settles . this is a superb looking pint .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : heavy pour yields a .5 finger coarse white head that seems to evaporate it disappears so quickly . beer is a semi-clear brownish-amber . lacing is very spotty and has no cling .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : black , just black . no light gets through at all . the head poured mocha at an inch thick quickly simmering to a quarter of an inch while coating the sides of the glass with webbing in its wake	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : probably the closest to `` motor oil '' as i 've ever seen in a beer . super thick and viscous , black as a moonless night with a thick & creamy one-finger chocolate-milk-colored head . absolutely gorgeous .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a bright orangey-copper color with a profusive , fizzy white head .	000000000000000
1	a : got ta love the nitro effect on this beer . when you crack the can , out pops a nice gushing sound and a small escape of foam . the beer pours the color of buttermilk at the start , then clears up to a bright amber about halfway through the pour . the head initially envelops about 2/3 of the glass as the nitrogen feels its way in waves up the glass . then , it settles in a 2 finger froth atop the brew and refuses to leave . makes for a great beer mustache .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear golden-amber body . a 1 '' off-white head quickly drops to a thin film , and a little later on drops to nothing at all . little to no lacing is left behind . inside the glass , an occasional small carbonation bubble rises slowly to the surface .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dark ( `` texas tea '' ) , chunky , quite a bit of sediment that dislodged a little too easily , low head	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : a nice clear dark red glass that holds a solid dirty tan head that laces all the way down with thick tidemarks : easy on the eyes all the way around .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : impossibly clear yellow . literally looks like piss . very small white head that disapears very quickly .	00000000000000000000

1	a : a nice rusty reddish-brown , topped with a sticky wite head , a little over a finger tall . plenty of lacing left behind . this is a rare instance ( not sure if it 's the first in my reviews ) where i feel the appearance is bang-on and perfect to style .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured a jet black with excellent carbonation leaving a beautiful brown cap	00000000000000
1	a : pours a hazy golden-copper body . a 1 '' slightly creme tinted head fades in a short while to a thick film . quite a bit of sticky strings and saggy curtains of lacing are left behind .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : 5 |	0000
1	a : clear orange amber color . two fingers of beige , fairly dense creamy head . retention is decent and a good robust ring of lacing is left . 2.5	0000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : awesome deep maroon color , reminds me of a red wine . not much carbonation , with no head or lacing . a slight oily texture , most likely due to the high alcohol content .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this poured a beautiful hazy dark ruby color with a light creamy and foamy tan head . the beer label is kinda earthy and ugly but the unique underside of the cap rocks , 2 campers and a big foot drinking beer together .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : really orange and very pretty . there was very little head , but a nice lacing foam never seemed to leave until i had a second pour . really coats the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : served in a smithwicks pint glass , this beer has a hugely enticing deep ruby red color . the head consists of a white foam which remains until the end of the glass due to a brewing process called lacing . unlike other ales , smithwicks will not develop a watery appearance after a few mouthfulls .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : very promising , crystal clear deep red-brown . pours too freely with no viscous reserve . small head with no creaminess which disappeared quickly .	000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very pale yellow indeed . almost no head , no lacing , just a few bubbles rising .	00000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a beautiful clear mahogany with tow fingers of tan head and good retention .	00000000000000000
1	appearance : a deep tentalizing ruddy spread , which leapt onto a fouled demention of wondrous showcase colours -- real and glitsy ; its head is flat-out spectacular .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear dark brown . killer head . two finger of it and frothy as all hell . awesome retention and plenty of lacing . 3.0	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a orange-brown body with semi-opaqueness under a two-finger white head with mild retention . minimal lacing	0000000000000000000
1	appearance : nice 2 inch head with a tan color . beer is golden orange with no speakable sediment.excellent head retention , it is taking an eternity to subside .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : mr. adams summer ale has quite a nice coloured body ( not a euphemism ) . it 's cloudy ( the way i likes my beers ) , and golden/honey bodied with a cappuccino froth white head . mmmm , methinks sir .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : nice amber , crazy hardcore strength head that lingered to the bottom of the glass .	000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy sienna colored brew with moderate carbonation . bubbly pink tinged head comes and goes in a flash . leaves no lace .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : one finger head of nice soft cream , good thickness , and favourable retention . nontransparent hazy copper colour . sm : orange peel citrus ester hops , cream , banana , and wheat . a moderate strength aroma .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a hazy amber ale with a persistent , peanut colored , three finger head . the residue sticks to the glass - tacky . good looker .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : deep brown with a billowing off white to tan head . lacing is pretty solid but the head fades moderately fast .	000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : this was a golden and , oddly enough , crystal clear wheat beer . i swirled the last inch or so of beer to get the sediment out , only to discover that there was no sediment . a white head rose up to one finger and dissipated quickly . a thin ring around the beer was the only thing left after a few minutes . there was little to no lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured first into my snifter with virtually no head but a harder pour into my wife 's pint glass revealed a 1 finger foam . weird and not what i expected . the color reminds me of cola without the fizz . what little foam i have does cling to the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : black as the dickens , impenetrable to light , light khaki head . very impressive head retention . nice lacing .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : cloudy amber with a nice cream head and lacing . looks perfect for a saison .	000000000000000000
1	a : light yellow with some hazy coloring . ample head and thick , sheetlike lacing . very nice . n : little to nothing . hops come through a bit , perhaps grassy .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : darkness warshed over the dude - darker'n a black steer 's tookus on a moonless prairie night . thin for such a dark stout ... minimal lacing & head .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a pitch black with 2 finger meringue like head . great retention and leaves some very nice webbed lace down the sides of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : well , clear golden with no visible head - no lace obviously .	000000000000000
0	appearance : tried it by half-pint and it pours slightly-dark amber colour , with minimal beerhead observed which left fine trace of lace along the way .	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : beautiful carmel brown color with a big , fluffy head that recedes to about two fingers . excellent and surprising clarity , given the style .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark brown out of the tap , with a full white head , which leaves lots of sticky lacing on the pint glass as the beer is drunk .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : what do you think ? it looks like someone took a piss in a glass . if you bother pouring it , which is optional , but it dooes release some decent flavouring ( see later ) .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a very pale yellow , even moreso than i might have expected . no head , rather just a trim of lace . kind of disappointing , overall .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark amber with a large , dense , stiff , tan head that left a sheet of lace around the whole glass as it receded into a pillow-y lumpy film .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a translucent , very pale , golden color . has a very thin , fizzy head that dissipates quickly and leaves little lacing .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : light golden color chill haze that never cleared . medium carbonation . large bubbled thin white head that was short lasting . lacing on the low end .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : beautiful clear deep copper/amber color with an off-white head that maintains a nice lacing . it looks very enticing to drink .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : three fingers of a medium brown creamy/frothy head is long lasting . the body is the darkest brown possible if it is n't purely black and no light comes through . only a spare amount of lacing finds it 's way to the glass , which is to the detriment of the rating , especially given the style .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : deep garnet with nice clarity for a bottle conditioned beer . a fizzy cream cap comes and goes quickly as it retreats to a ring at the edge of the beer . leaves no lace .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear tinted orange-golden body with two fingers of white foamy head . good retention and leaves thick lacing .	000000000000000000000
0	a : pours murky light amber-brown with a modest off-white head . honestly , this beer looks like iced tea .	000000000000000000000
0	a : golden beer , more bubbles than normal . almost no lasting head .	000000000000000
0	a : pours a deep reddish color . minimal head with poor retention and almost no lacing .	000000000000000000
1	a : as with all guinnesses , it really is gorgeous . nice creamy head , nice brownish bubble effects .	000000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy , pale yellow with a thin layer of head that disappears quickly leaving absolutely no evidence that it was there at all . really not that much to look at .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this has a light haze to it , which is odd for a distilled spirit ( is n't it ? ) . i do n't even know how to rate this . it 's mildly leggy , i suppose . i 'll give it a 3.5 , and that 's as high as i 'll go , because it 's brewdog .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : head leaves little to be desired . nothing lasting , no lacing . surprised frankly . have n't seen a head of foam drop that fast in a while .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a nice dark bok colour , but too much crap floating in there . yes , you expect a bit of haze in an unfiltered beer but this is over the top .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : black coffee . not much else . no head to speak of either .	0000000000000000
1	a : pale with a fake-peachy/apricot colored tinge to it that makes it glow . they call it copper , and it really does look like a bright copper metal -- not the `` copper '' color you usually call beer . incredible clarity -- rich color but at the saem time completely transparent . its apperance matches its smell and flavor so well that i have to say it has a fairly perfect appearance .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a brown-black blend , impenetrable in my tulip but definitely shows some light through the edges if i hold it close to a lamp . has a strong mocha ( ha ! ) colored head that retains well and leaves splotches of lacing down the sides .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours like motor oil , pitch black , thick , viscous , and absolutely no head ... .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : `` looks like a miller high life '' , claims one wiseman . clear and golden with white , head and pretty good lacing .	000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : ridiculously rich head and great retention . wow ! ! ! !	00000000000000
1	appearance : beautiful . dark brown , practically black , with an incredible cascading effect from the nitro-tap . the head and rest of the beer blended together , and took a long time to separate . once they did , the beer was left with three fingers of off-white head , one of which lingered for the entire glass . tons of lacing , too .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear orange yellow ; inert ; head dissipates quickly ; no lacing	00000000000000
0	a : when poured into the glass it looks , quite simply , static and lifeless as you could tell from the `` action '' ... coming in a very pale amber hue and a fluffy head , with minimum carbonation . i 'm ready to embrace a flat pint ...	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : very good , rosey-brown color	0000000
1	a : pretty much pitch black . does n't allow light to pass through . moderate amount of dark head that , as it dies down , turns a slightly lighter tan color . appears to be thick .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : slow pour yielded very dark maroon brown liquid beneath a finger and a half solid layer of very dense foam that took forever to slowly fade into a very thick and well retained head that lasted the whole beer through . great streaks of thick lacing were left down the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : this beer pours the darkest of all `` hefeweizens '' i have ever seen , and it is quite murky in appearance . i was somewhat turned off by the color , but the bubbles were abundant .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : basically no head . light gold . very light rising carbonation .	00000000000000
1	appearance : wonderful dark amber smoky body with an off white crown that looks as patient as the tide . flavor : over burnt grains and a very strong vegetal note . i have to believe this was infected or just silly old .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a four finger head of pathetic thinness , no cream , and awful retention . seemingly overcarbonated judging by the wealth of bubbles . colour is a semitransparent copper . largely unappealing . sm : heavy apricot is all i can detect . a moderately strong aroma . a bit artificial though .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : beautiful red hue ale with a decent bubbly head . really all of goose 's belgium style ales appear beautiful in the glass .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a murky dark amber with a soft off-white head , fair retention . almost opaque .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : this is the only area were this beer falls short . the appearance is somewhere between white grape juice , wine , and mead with color and characteristics of them all . a light , white , honey mead color with almost a complete lack of head and lacing . light streams of carbonation .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pitch black body ( or so it appeared in the dim lighting ) with a quarter inch of dense , light brown , cap . great head retention and foamy lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : slightly hazy and pear in color . the head is white and is a good two fingers .	00000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours with 2 fingers of tan head . this settles to a thin layer of foam , leaving behind nearly complete lacing . the beer itself is a very dark brown with the slightest hints of mahogany around the edges . no sediment in the bottle .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : the body color is ruby red and the head is close to an egg-shell . the head has great retention that leads to super lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : moderate pour yields apple juice ... yep ... plain and simple apple juice . you want more ? ok fine ... .5 finger white head that dissipates quickly , partially clear slightly orangy-yellow beer . near non-existant lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : half finger head of slight cream , fair thickness , and poor retention . hazy murky gold colour . sm : cream . malt . barley . what else is new ? mild esters . i like the cream .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : amber with golden hues . it poured with a medium cream head that died to a film .	00000000000000000000
1	a : pours an amber/caramel/golden brown . cloudy and appropriate for the style . big , frothy head that gradually recedes to about a finger and sticks around . thick , benchmark lacing . it has the kind of vigorous carbonation i associate with bottle conditioning ( whether rightly or wrongly ) . nice yeasty dregs .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a very cola-like colour and consistency into a sweetwater pint glass ... thin tan head with decent lacing ... watery looking brew , not much to porter standards	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured a clear amber color . the head was small and faded quickly . mildly disappointing , to be honest .	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : free pour yields a 1.5 inch fizzy pink head that dissipates steadily and loudly . pours a semi-translucent red and leaves sweeping arches of lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear orange/amber color . poured a 3 finger off-white head with fair retention to a lumpy 1 finger cap . decanted lightly . laced in broken rings .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a very dark brown with a reddish tint to it . very soapy and bubbly head dissipates very fast -- no retention on the head . bubbles on the sides of the glass make me believe it 's carbonated , but i 'm not sure as the cork slide out of the bottle and did n't pop . looking at the cork now , i see it did n't expand outward as most corks in beer bottles do once they 're popped . this almost looks like an aggressively poured red wine .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark brown hue with good head and great lacing . the one thing i can not get past are the floaties . yeast is everywhere , and this beer is still young .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : the color is n't anything special , really , but it 's pours quite clear with a nice head and good retention . a good level of carbonation is exhibited with a steady stream of bubbles rising from the nucleation points in the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a very chilled and hazy dark straw that bubbles to a very light brown at the body of the glass . a fluffy , pure white head forms on the pour , about one finger in height , that stick with me down the entire glass . splotches of lace follow me down the glass . looks perfect .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : maplesyrup colored . very little head , less than one fingerwidth .	00000000000000

1	a : clear , dark brown with a thick head and nice lacing .	00000000000000
1	appearance : probably the best looking belgian stout i 've seen . i could n't stop looking at it . pours a big 3 finger light tan head that 's a little thin but very persistent . head dissipates slowly , bubbly and unevenly into a thick film cap that stays the whole way down . lots of chunky lacing coats the glass all the way to the bottom . is dark brown , almost black , in colour and shows quite a bit of carbonation .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a very nice golden orange , slightly hazy , and very nice 1 finger head that settles to a small cap and leaves sticky lacing all over the glass . very impressive . off to a great start .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : dark dark brown , basically black , with a nice rocky tan head with a little retention . little bit of lace . does n't look too bad .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a devilish start its black as night . i even brought it outside in the afternoon sun to see its color more clearly . the result : still black . not a single hint of sunlight shone through . damn , thats thick . the head is just as dense ; tan like wet beach sand and unrelentingly creamy . its assertive , too , coming to a full two-and-a-half fingers before my pour was even finished . sexy lacing stays around for quite a while , as well . i really like how this beer looks .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this pours a hazy copper hue and is topped with generous head . the head on this stuff is the whitest ive ever seen and holds up insanely well . it looks like it 's made of styrofoam .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a clear copper body with a small wisp of offwhite hued head that soon falls to film and collar . sparse patches of lace are left on the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : lemonade colored with just about no head , it turned a bit more orangey and opaque when i got a refill .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : if it were n't for the little hue of yellow , it would be as clear as mineral water . head seems like it could have some retention , forming a good finger and a half ... but then bam ... it 's gone . absolutely no lacing , nothing . just this incredibly pale yellow liquid in the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : served right after a small '08 darkness pour and the first thing i thought was damn , that 's an impressive head . great ebony color with some naughty lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : it pours a very dark red color with a two and a half finger , off-white head that holds and laces incredibly well .	00000000000000000000000000

0	a : copper-amber , fairly opaque , no head .	0000000000
0	appearance : a really unimpressive pour , with absolutely no carbonation ; the liquid was a murky , apricot nectar color	000000000000000000000

1	appearance : there was a very small off-gas when popping the cap , which was surprising ... but the beer is very cold . after a relatively aggressive pour the head was pretty small ( ~1/4 '' ) , but some pretty nice vortex action started and there were numerous bubbles rising to maintain the head at about 1/16 '' all the way across the top of the beer . there is already some lacing on the glass as the head recedes . after drinking , there are some heavy sheets of lace left on the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : completely opaque - does n't even let light through ! nice fluffy head , 1.5 fingers , white , good retention , decent lacing .	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pitch plack with a nice mocha colored head that is moderately thick and retains very well . it leaves almost wine like legs when swirled , exactly what i am looking for in a stout	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pale yellow with thin white head that quickly disappears . very urine-like .	000000000000000
0	a : aggressive pour yields a 1 finger coarse white head that dissipates quickly into a collection of big bubbles . beer is a clear lemon . lacing is very spotty with web-like patterns that cling very close to a barely-there head .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : beautiful pale gold color , the foaming head envelopes the whole glass before equalizing out to a nice white foam on top , which does not dissipate . light amount of lacing on the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a bright red with thick pink head that fades quickly . average lacing .	00000000000000000
1	appearance : looks absolutely amazing . almost like a nitro-stout how the head suddenly rose from nothing , before settling to some sturdy light tan foam . dark brown body looks about black in the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : nice thick head , golden colour , nice pillars of bubbles rising up : perfect	00000000000000000
1	a : honey colored , clear . medium white head with fantastic lacing .	00000000000000
1	appearance : wow , this is a beaut . stunning clear ruby red with mahogany undertones . a thick , pocked berg of espresso foam with excellent retention tops it . great lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured with a tan fizzy head that dissipated quickly leaving no lacing . the beer is a reddish brown color and completely clear , resembling cranberry-apple juice .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dark with very subtle reddish hues , with only a few hints of froathy bubbles . again , i 'm sure it 's historically accurate , but i do n't have to like it ...	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : black on the pour , non-translucent , with a very thin layer of bubbles capping the surface . bubbles reduced to a thin line around the glass . lacing was present but light .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a beautiful 3 finger fluffy white head with great retention . beer itself is a semi-cloudy peach color . lacing is patchy and full with great cling . perfection ... i ca n't imagine a beer looking more `` commercial-like '' than this one .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : black , tan head , very little retention or lace .	0000000000000

1	appearance : pours a light copper color with a firm head that dissipates quickly leaving some lacing .	000000000000000000
1	a : appears an attractive dark purplish pink with a big frothy dark pink head . nice retention . great color in the body and the head , and great clarity .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : great deep color . good head and lacing .	00000000000
0	a : a very typical , clear and solid brown . head was more than i thought it would be , around an inch	000000000000000000000000
1	a : a dark amber/brown color . this has a huge creamy , foamy beige head . spotty patches of thick lace . this does not look like any american ipa i have ever seen .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : thick , three finger , creamy , tan head . great retention , leaving plenty of lacing . almost clear , reddish brown body . impressive looking .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this beer looks really good . crystal clear gold with very active carbonation from small bubbles . pillow like white head has incredible retention and leaves substantial lace .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : garnered a dark caramel color but unfortunately no head at all nor lacing . i think i might have gotten a flat one considering there was little pop when uncorking . there is also a lot of big pieces of yeast floating throughout even after a very careful and soft pour .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : the beer pours a clear brown color with no head at all , just a thin ring ...	00000000000000000000
0	a : deep and black , with just the tiniest collar of bubbly head that sticks around for a few moments and recedes to nothing . with each sip , there are some hints of brown through the edges .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : i was also excited when i saw it in the glass . huge head that sticks like rib sauce to the glass and a nice ruby orangy beer . 4.5	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a beautiful head that lasts forever - 3 fingers and leaves a great skim across the top during the entire session . cloudy orange in appearance	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : buoyant head ; solid black ( what else ? ) ; great carbonation	000000000000000
0	a : no sustained head	00000
0	a : pours a one finger head of very slight cream , fair thickness , and poor retention . colour is a semitransparent yellow . sm : cream , stale barley , and caramelized malt . a mild strength aroma .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : beautiful head & lacing , dark dark brown , probably one step above black . head retention was excellent .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : no release of carbonation when corked : - ( clear , slightly claret hued brown liquid . very little head leaves very little trace of a ring in very little time . more head please .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a cloudy honey-gold with three fingers of white head that eventually recedes into a thin ring with no lacing . lots of floaties in this beer .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : ridiculously large off-white head w/ great retention & lacing . hazy brown body .	0000000000000000
0	a : the beer pours a slightly cloudy , but can still see through orange . a billow white head rose over two inches , but faded ridiculously fast , and left no lace . i could have sworn i had just poured a glass of soda , or orange shasta , strange .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a nice golden hue with a 1/2 finger head . great retention and spotty lace . nice to look at in the glass .	000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours dark-straw or amber colour , with a sparse head and very limited carbonation . nothing special for a bitter , really .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured a clear , pale copper-orange with a beautiful 2 finger frothy white head that had amazing retention while leaving a nice sheet lacing on the way down . visible carbonation was almost non-detect .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this was served without a lemon , thankfully . this beer had the typical cloudy witbier look . the thin head left quickly with nothing left behind .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : urine yellow , kinda like the wahoo . almost no head . poor lacing .	00000000000000000
0	a : copper orange body . rome was n't built in a day , but this head built up rapidly and fell faster than you can say brutus .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : deep blood red color , a bit cloudy , great retention and lacing on the 2-finger head . could n't be better .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : pale yellow-orange body boasting three fingers of fluffy white head . retention is great and leaves loads of lacing .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : there was something seriously wrong with the yeast in this beer . a careful pour resulted in huge chunks of what i guess is yeast coming out of the bottle and into the glass . the resulting mess looked like a murky brown snow globe . it was absolutely full of white chunks . i do n't know if it was supposed to be like this but i doubt it .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a hazy mahogany body with a mild head . this came out of a pitcher , so i ca n't fault the appearance much as far as head goes .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : quite a deep amber - quite a bit darker than many others of the same style . head fizzled up quickly and dramatically , but drops just as swiftly .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a healthy white head leaves think rings of lace down the glass . slightly hazy gold color .	00000000000000000000
0	a : poured a golden , macro yellow . not much head to speak of with little to no retention . no lacing to write mom about .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : impressive look for a porter . brown , almost black with a thick lasting head and tan lacing .	000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a light yellow with two fingers of bone-white head that quickly fade . minimal lacing .	0000000000000000000
0	a : pale yellow gold , no head , wisp ring . appearance of a lot of upright beers are a little watery and the weakest part of the score . this one is no exception . 3/5	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark brown almost black in color with about 1/2 finger of head that disappeared fairly quickly . nice lacing though .	00000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a cola brown with a one finger off-white head . not much retention , the head looks pretty thin and flimsy . not as appetizing as others once poured . even with an aggressive pour , it was pretty pathetic .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : can is poorly designed , but big with the abv listed proudly and large .	00000000000000000
0	a : dingy yellow-orange body , completely transparent , with precisely no head .	00000000000000
1	a : deep copper color with red shades	00000000
1	a : shining copper with a fizzy , quick-to-vanish head and moderate carbonation .	00000000000000
0	appearance : this one only get a 3.0 because i really like the color of it . i poured pretty hard ( i 'm not a fan of carbonation ) and i still got only a one finger head that disappeared before i could blink and no lacing to speak of .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : nice golden color , a little dark for a pils , no head to speak of ( common from this brewery in my experience )	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured a beautiful copper color , head stayed through out , with good lacing , and substantial carbonation as well .	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : beautiful , clear , light amber beer with bubbles rising through the mug to the thin one finger hear . head is moderate in duration with light lacing . head will not keep volatile aromatic molecules in beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a dense , 2-finger head that recedes gradually and leaves beautiful lace on the glass . color is desribed on the bottle as being `` tawny , '' and i could n't agree more . bright and clear , no sign of haziness . gorgeous presentation .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a nice dark blackish hue with strong tones of brown showing through . the head was 2 full fingers in height with nice rich mocha coloring . the retention was good with a nice solid ring hanging around for the duration . spotty lace noted as well .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear , golden yellow appearance . medium sized head that dissipates rather fast .	0000000000000000
0	a : pale yellow color , slightly hazy , small head with little retention	00000000000000
1	a : deep copper with a solid white head that dropped a touch too quickly , though it was still leaving lacing from its small ring later in the session .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : though it was served in a can , when pouring some out on the sidewalk for my dead homies , i noticed a pale yellow color . the color is much akin to standard cass and all korean macros for that matter . it is not in any way red ... the redness denotes the color of the can . that 's a standard korean misjudgment , and i find it oddly charming .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : the beer poured a promising dark brown with ruby opaqueness . the beer has a tan head and looks creamy good . dam appearances arent everything .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured from the glass flask into a brandy snifter . flat . about 6 bubbles form , then pop . flat looking liqour like beverage , which i have come to expect after reading some reviews . there is also some cloudy brown sediment in different shades . all in all , not very appealing looking for a beer . still , i was not deterred from embibing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a golden honey color . finger size head that quickly retreats .	000000000000000
1	a : poured a murky cherry color with good carbonation leaving a dirty white cap	000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a nearly opaque brown body with a cascading 3 finger toffee colored head than recedes to nothing in less than a minute .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : smoky colored	0000
0	appearance : dark amber/ light brown -- too dark for an ipa , with off-white head that fades fairly quickly . ( score as a scottish ale : 3-3.5 )	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : standard pour reveals how viscous and heavy this one is . no head or lacing . beer is a cloudy reddish-silt color .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a hazy dark golden color with a soap-like crisp white head made mostly of big bubbles . you can see some carbonation rising from the glass to the foam cap .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : light orange-golden , hazy color , with a large enough white head with good lacing .	000000000000000000
1	a : a pretty gorgeous golden amber with a dense , white head . retention is pretty good , and there 's a little lace .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear dark cherry ruby color . creamy tan head .	000000000000
1	a : absolutely no light gets through , but retains a great foam ring around the glass .	000000000000000000
1	a : the can opens with a fizz as the nitro widget releases its gas . the agitation almost caused white head to peter out over the mouth of the can . a three step pour into a guinness glass resulted in the magnificent visual bubbling effect . the stout 's body was a dark red-black color , more reddish at the narrower points of the glass . atop the black body was a white , slightly tan , head that stayed in place throughout the pint . visually stunning , regardless of how it may taste .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : very light golden straw , little to no head	00000000000
0	a : perfectly clear pale yellow . pours 1 finger head that falls almost immediately . some lace .	0000000000000000000
1	a : pours a hazy orange/red with a one finger head that dissipates quickly down to a very small layer of foam on top . nice sheets of lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : 1/2 finger of fine , lacy head . clear , dark brown , inviting .	00000000000000000
1	a : great dark copper color with 2 finger head . good lacing .	00000000000000
0	a : disappointing , quite honestly . deep sienna color with nice clarity and minimal carbonation . even a vigorous pour would n't net much of a head . all i could get was a seltzer fizz that disappeared after only a few seconds in the glass . left no lace .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : to me , this is just a gorgeous beer . amber gold glow , nice off-white head with minimal lacing as consumed .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : an opaque brown body that exhibited absolutely no head or lace-like qualities . i contribute this to the high alcohol by volume , but still , not quite what i had anticipated for this beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : no head , dark brown in color with a slightly reddish tint . the beer is nearly opaque when held up to a light , but not quite .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : transparent brown w/ not much of a head and no lacing . maybe i 'm at part to blame as i poured it over-carefully as to not get a glass full of yeast like my first one .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : an exceptional balance between pale yellow and orange , like orange blossom honey .	0000000000000000
0	appearance : with an average pour not much head is produced , and lacing is basically nil . color is a dark amber/gold .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : yellow tinted water with a one finger foamy white head that was gone in under 2 minutes .	00000000000000000000
0	a : deep amber color has good clarity and minimal carbonation . small fizzy head dissipates quickly and leaves no lace .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured a nice golden color . clean and clear in appearance . this brew had a big creamy head to it that did not quickly dissipate . i had to let it sit for a couple of minutes before i could pour the rest .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : murky brown with a thin tan head that quickly disappears . very boring looking , even a little off-putting .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy deep orange . little head that audibly pops down to nothing pretty quick .	00000000000000000
1	a : this time i choose to drink it `` kristalklaar '' ... in a 300ml weissbier glass it pours a slightly dark-golden colour , with an effervescent white beer head building up non-stoppingly , so tight and frothy the head simply refuses to go away ; exceptional for a british bottle-conditioned beer ( or my choice of glassware this time might greatly help with the head retention ? ? ) . carbonation is fierce at first but gradually softens and remains consistently lively , when combined with the colour the whole thing looks more like a bottled lager ! ! next to perfect , for a bottle-conditioned ale .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a tangerine colour with a frothy white head . very active while pouring , continues to bubble merrily afterwards .	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : awesome golden , crystal clear , body with a sticky , film-like head that stuck to the side of the glass like a glue stick . yeast sediment was heavy at bottom .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a very dark brown color -- almost black . even with a careful pour , a good 3 '' of head forms , which hindered me the entire rest of the beer . would not go away . pretty impressive retention and lacing . when held up to light i see some dark ruby highlights . great looking brew .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy , chock-full-o sediment . honestly , it 's a bit revolting to me . but i know that the overall color ( amber ) and texture ( lots of fine carbonation ) appear to be fine , so i 'll just slightly rate it below average .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a deep golden color with a tinge of copper , soft cottony head , some lacing down the sides of the glass - 4.50 ,	000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : hazy golden body peppered with lots of small and large particles in solution . up top , over two fingers of fluffy white head that leaves great lacing . as you approach the bottom of the bottle , it becomes almost milkshake thick with terrific sediment .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this is a very dark ruby red , not quite black . it pour with a big foamy off-white that leaves lots of lace in its wake .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : yellow , short white head that dissipates as fasts as it forms . leaves no lacing . worse head retention than soda .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : pinkish/purple cloudy brown with a cream collar and creeping lace .	0000000000000
1	appearance : poured a beautiful orange and yellow with a nice , light haze . the selling point was seeing that abundant crisp , white head rise up in front of my eyes .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a nice light gold in color , very cloudy , tons of sediment here . a small wispy head gave way to very little lacing or retention . kind of dissapointing since the color of this is the only thing holding it up in the looks column .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : straw yellow , huge pillowing head , and some lacing .	0000000000000

1	a : comes in a clear dark amber hue , with incredibly thick frothy beer head sustaining forever , it seems . one of the most beautifully presented pint i 've ever had the pleasure to taste .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : opaque pale yellowish , typical wheat beer color .	00000000000

1	appearance : pours into my victory becker a crystal clear , golden copper-orange . the head is a dark beige and holds pretty steady until finally dropping to a hearty collar with patchy bubbles all over the surface .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : blonde , amber with a one finger head . poured from a 25 oz bottle into two glasses . the yeast starts a flowin about 2/3 through and unless you wan na drink all the yeasties , you lose about a fifth of the bottle . i chose to drink the plethora of yeasty particulates , but it definitely loses some points for appearance .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured slowly into a duvel tulip glass . same beautiful head that its little brother `` professor gesser '' has . 2/3 of the glass is filled with cream-colored fluff and the bottom 1/3 is glowing orange . carbonation speeds to the top and the head slowly ( very slowly ) recedes . lacing holds on forever .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : clear golden honey , very sturdy off-white head . i may be hallucinating but i thought i detected a greenish tone in the shadows of the fluffy stuff . very nice appearance .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a very nice , cloudy , light caramel color with a massive 3.5 finger widths of white head . the head is very dense and last forever , taking literally well over 10 min to dissipate to a level that allows drinking . about a finger widths head remains and lasts the entire drink , leaving some of the heaviest lacing i have ever seen . cant imagine a better looking beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this beer pours a 1 finger head that recedes quickly , but leaves a lot of lacing on the glass regardless of temperature . very pretty brown/red almost rusty orange color that is completely opaque and darker than i expected . the second beer i poured of course was completely saturated with yeasty floaters throughout . i do n't mind this and actually like the taste of the yeast in my beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : deep dark brown nearly black , no head rentetion at all and poured very rough	00000000000000000
1	a : poured a hazy lemonade color with light orange hues and an outright explosive carbonation factor that literally looked like a torrential tropical storm inside the glass . large bran flake like yeast matter race up and down inside the glass in the strong circulating current . the wild yeast was evident upon the pour yielding a quickly evolving snow white rocky head that rose with authority into a towering structure . all the time i was marveling at the beers coloring and head in my glass , unbeknownst to me the bottle was spewing foam like an erupting volcanoe at a steady and fast rate forcing me to run for backup glasses to catch the runoff and do some containment and reclamation effort . the lacing provided an incredible coverage on the glass of large patches of foam after the slow retreat of the head . after more then 5 minutes the effervesce eventually settles down a bit revealing a thick haziness and coloring that was similar to orange juice . an absolute picture perfect example in the glass worthy of any beer mag cover . perfect regards from me here .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : pours a light golden colour which is a little brown . the head formation was pretty poor and the head subsided quite quickly leaving little to no head or lacing . the carbonization was also visibly non-existent .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : not much of a lager drinker , but the beer was invaded by bubbles . i mean hundreds of them ! the color was crystal clear and a light golden honey color . pouer with a decent head that did seem to dissapate rather quickly leaving little lacing . not that impressed ...	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a dark amber color with a pretty thick white head . the beer itself looks cool , but the label ... well , do n't get me started . i used to think the old label art was pretty cool looking . it reminded me of what halloween used to be . this new one though , looks like it was made in photoshop in about an hour . i typically dont care about art on the beer , but this new one sucks compared to what they had . got ta take a point off for that .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : beer is a pale straw yellow with very active carbonation and an unbelievably pillowy white head that sits about three fingers high and hangs around for ages leaving gobs of sticky lacing on the side of the glass as it gradually recedes . a thick cap is left behind for good measure	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : great orangish appearance . reminds me of a perfectly ripe peach . lacing is clumpy and lingers . n : spice , specifically peppercorn , is foremost but is rounded out nicely with summer fruits ( peach and apples predominantly ) . hints of banana esters really hit home that this is a saison . while i do enjoy the components , i do n't feel they work very well together in this beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : let me say this now . there is nothing more impressive than the head on a belgian ipa . it looks like drifting artic landscape . this beer poured with around 5 fingers of head into a big ass duvel tulip . the lacing melts the glass . very hazy blonder color . looks like a darker version of a heff .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : i do n't know if its from the style or not , but it pours a cloudy light amber . unless its an unfiltered beer i do n't really approve of cloudy ( could be part of the style ) . head is a light yet thick 2 finger minimum head . head leaves a good lacing all the way down the glass . not a lot of film from the beer . a lot of carbonation can be seen too .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours with an amazingly dense 4 fingered head of nearly white foam . this settles very slowly and hardly at all , still retaining most of its original height . where it has dropped , the lacing is thick and sticky . amazing . the beer itself is cloudy and orange .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : poured into a smaller snifter this virtually black bodied beer has a reverse cascading burnt caramel head that flexes with all its might . lacing is great . head retention is n't amazing , but great too . dark and mean , what a ris should look like .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear ruby-black body with a moderate amount of carbonation rising from the etched `` d '' ; 3+ finger head fills half the tulip with frothy tan foam that seems unwilling to go away , and leaves nice chunky lace when it finally does . awesome looking barleywine .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : beautiful dark brown pour with a gigantic head and lots of effervescent bubble action drifting towards the bottom ; finally settles to about 1 finger of light tan head , no lace , and a pitch black body .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : amber with excellent clarity for a bottle conditioned beer . very active carbonation . soapy off-white head has amazing retention and leaves a very heavy lace . an really nice looking beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : thin off white head . very dark brown . a little sporadic lacing . somewhat disappointing .	0000000000000000000
0	a : standard pour yields near no head . beer is an opaque black . lacing is spotty and stringy with no cling but nice legs . a bit below average . thick and viscous looking though .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours an extremely dark clear brown with a super carbonated spritzy head that foamed up in the glass . head disappeared rather quickly though and receded into a thin collar that left a pretty decent sheet of lacing down the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours a very clear amber color with about 1/2 '' of tan bubbles on top after an aggressive pour . there are some bubbles rising , but the head is on its way somewhere within the first 30 seconds . the beer leaves some solid lacing on the glass after drinking , so it is a very well presented dipa .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : clear chestnut color with ruby highlights when held to the light . generous bubbles up the glass . pours with a 2 '' dense head that continues to grow in the center of the glass , resulting in an ice-cream-cone like appearance . takes close to 10 minutes to die down into a half-inch of foam on top of the brew . leaves nice rings of lacing down the glass as i sip .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : still the same lovely look , a bit nicer of a head that lingers more and provides more lacing . maybe because it 's not in a chilled glass ? the difference is amazing ... looks perfect	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : crystal clear and yellow , the beer begins teeming with effervescence and opens with a thick white head . the bubbles diminuendo to stillness , while the head exhibits staying power and coats the glass in white lacing . a very impressive appearance .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a hazy deep ruby-brown body . massive 2 '' slightly off-white head seems to take forever to fade to a thin film . lots of big , thick strings of lacing are left on the glass , mostly from the initial head . a narrow column of tiny carbonation bubbles rises very quickly from the center of the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : dark copper with a slightly off-white head that lingers leaving a beautiful lacing on the glass . there is some haze , but that 's probably cause the beer was bottle-conditioned and i accidentally just dumped all the sediment in ( long day at work and i was rushing to pour my evening beer ) .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : pours a pretty pale golden which is very translucent . no real definite head , though there is some rather small lace going on . i 'd say the aesthetic appearance of the beer is it 's only downfall , as well as the lack of head & head retention .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : a slightly hazy medium amber body with half and inch of tight white foam is the result of a fairly harsh pour . kind of flat , and kind of disappointing . still , not an ugly beer ( although definitely dark for a saison ) .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours into my duvel tulip a crystal clear amber with a distinct reddish hue . the head is slightly off-white and one full finger high , and it seems to last thanks to the etching in the bottom of the glass . giant spider webs of lace track the entire way down the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a light orange color , nice 2 finger width frothy white head with lots of lacing down the glass . much lighter in color than i expected a winter beer to be .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : striking kool-aid red body , huge off-white head which leads a lot of lace as it fades . streams of carbonation make their way to the surface .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : orange-yellow cloudy , very little head	00000000
1	appearance : pours a hazy golden body with a frothy egg white head that shows good retention and leaves plenty of lacing	0000000000000000000000
0	a : poured a dark , dark brown , almost black , that came gushing out of the bottle after a hard pour ... well ... flat as a pancake .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : light yellow.. very pale straw.. clear body.. head settles very quickly..	0000000000000
1	appearance : just as i remember , guinness is one of the best looking beers i 've ever seen . the upward cascade of nitrogen bubbles is a sight to behold . once the process is complete you 're left looking at a beer that looks like it 's straight out of promotional material . it 's picture perfect , the edge between the head and the beer itself looks like it was drawn on with a ruler . speaking of the head there was about two fingers worth and it stuck around for the duration leaving some quality lacing . the beer itself is black at first glace , but mahogany tones come through when any light hits .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours with 1 1/2 fingers of nearly pure white head . this settles slowly to a thin yet complete cap of foam , leaving behind nice lacing . the beer itself is a bright , medium yellow and perfectly clear . shows a fair amount of activity .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours like an under carbonated old ale , absolutely no head . nothing , no pop of the bottle , no head at all .	000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dark reddish-brown , kind of like coca-cola actually . no real head to speak of , but there is some thin lace .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : solid pee yellow . not much of a head .	000000000000
0	appearance : soft but structurally unsound head . let the label be your guide as to the color	000000000000000000
0	appearance : clear orange-amber , almost no head .	000000000
1	appearance : wonderful red/orange color . light suds and high viscosity . low/medium visibility . looks ominous in the glass .	000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a deep amber color with a really big fluffy head with adequate lacing .	00000000000000000
0	a : extra pale yellow color , the foamy head is thin but never disappear ;	0000000000000000
1	a : really nice looking almost clear color . it was kind of weird . under some light it would look a little yellow but then it would almost look like super watered down milk .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : cloudy golden color with a thick rocky head that just does n't quit even after 10 minutes . a ton of sticky lace . this is what a beer is supposed to look like .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very light golden body with a large white head that disappears pretty quickly and leaves a little lace .	000000000000000000000
1	a : first pour gave me a ton of head , so an additional pour was necessary . hazed straw color . three fingers of creamy white head . retention is very good and the lacing covers the entire glass . 3.5	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : burn copper in color slight haze . very tight tan head that clings to the glass .	0000000000000000000
1	a : pours a glowing tangerine flesh , hazy . good sized head with pretty good retention and decent lacing .	000000000000000000000
0	a : a yellow hazy/pale body with a small carbonated head ( fast dissipation ) minimal lacing .	000000000000000000
0	a : pours a half finger head of slight cream , fair thickness , and poor retention . caramel-amber in colour . nontransparent . sm : dark fruit : maybe cherry or plum , caramelized malt ( tame , not overdone ) , maybe hints of wine , and general esters . no alcohol . moderate in strength .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a hazy pale yellow/straw under a fizzy small white head that dissipates quickly , with no lace .	000000000000000000000
1	a : black with a tan 4-finger foamy head . this beer held up !	000000000000000
0	a : dark in color as you would expect , not to much carbonation or head to speak of , just a half of a finger for no more than a minute .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a clear amber color with a magnificent head that leaves a streaky pattern of lace	000000000000000000
0	a : pours a pale yellow color with a big white fluffy head . small retention and only few lacings left	000000000000000000000
0	a : orange marmalade with a slight haze . small off white dissipated almost immediately to a thin ring and was gone by a third of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured it into my urthel glass and it looked viscous . a deep dark brown color near to black . did n't observe any head at all .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : crystal clear . huge white head . many tiny bubbles . awesome lacing	000000000000000
1	a : poured a sluggish near pitch black with a brown head	000000000000
1	a : looks perfect , as it should for a macro beer . perhaps a bit too dark for an american ale being on the darker side of amber and pretty reddish . nice off-white head on the top .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : 't is a lovely crimson tide that cascades into the glass . the carbonation appears ample though the lacing is minimal .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : no head , no lacing , no cover . cloudy stray body . looks a bit like unfiltered ice tea . not impressive .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : i cant give this good marks when they color the beer with caramel coloring give me a break what shit	0000000000000000000000
0	a : looks a little light and adjuncty from first impressions ; goldish yellow with a pure , white fizzy head . nice lacing for the duration of consumption though .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a very dark brown , completely opaque . maybe a finger worth of loose , yet creamy tinted head . dies to a thick creamy skim within a minute or two . decent lacing throughout .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a crystal-clear golden-straw body capped by over two fingers of bubbly white head that fades slowly and leaves good lacing .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : i only give 5 's to perfection and a pint of guinness is sheer perfection . had it off the tap and it was a beautiful black with that gorgeous tan cascading foam head . it just does n't get better than a guinness .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : literally looks like apple juice or urine ... but in a good way ... and i know that sounds weird . lol . after a heavy pour , isabelle did n't seem to exhibit any apparent head or significant lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clearish golden color with a fluffy white head with great retention and plenty of lace . a looker . 5/5	0000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a very very dark brown , almost black , with raisin highlights . a very thin head surfaced then receded into a lasting collar that left spotty lace down the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : uplands lambics usually are n't that visually appealing , but this one is easily the worst . opaque plum color . this was a category one gusher , so little was lost ( and fortunately little was gained with regard to my clothes ) . anyway , the initial three fingers of frothy head quickly fell to half a finger . blackberry particules were abundant on the glass and in this last half finger of head . to be more descriptive , it looks like blackberry puree is hovering over the beer itself . 4.0	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very hazy golden brown with lots of big floaties all over the place . not doing much for me here	0000000000000000000000
1	a : a dark amber in color with a nice thick white head . nice lacing all the way through as well .	00000000000000000000000
0	appearance : not much to this one , poured with a crystal clear yellow that is reminiscent of a light beer . a lot of carbonation initially stuck to the sides of the glass on the pour , and it made a good thumb of head . however , within mere minutes the carbonation had completely died out . needless to say , no lacing either .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this is an amazing looking beer . dark brown in color with a 1.5 finger mocha colored head with excellent retention and lacing .	00000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : nice looking beer . golden , bright , head dissipates into an attractive lace on the glass . yum !	0000000000000000000000
0	a : the cloudiest professional-made beer i have ever encountered . russet-colored , with virtually no head . frankly , this beer looks like muddy , red oklahoma lake water ; although , as eric and lauren salazar explained , the lychee extract was milky and opaque , so i suppose it is justifiable .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a golden , cloudy straw color with a a white fluffy , big , and foamy head . basically my glass had 10 % beer in it and 90 % head . and the head stiff and sticky so it did n't go down that quickly . i 'm all for lively beers , but this was ridiculous . it did n't even look nice since most of the glass was foam . that 's not appealing to me .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : deep golden color that leads to a creamy small bubbled head	0000000000000
1	appearance : not sure if it 's because the waitress left the pint on the bar for 15 minutes before delivery , but there was no head on the pour . or at least , it dissipated quickly and did n't linger . jet black though , it looked thick and smoky .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : beautiful deep color of tangerine and orange with a hazy clarity . the head was minimal and disappeared quickly . lacing is wet and slides down into the liquid pretty quick .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this had a black body and poured with a medium sized , tan colored head .	000000000000000000
0	appearance : light yellow blond ; quickly dissipating limited foam head and carbonation .	00000000000000
1	a : poured jet black woth good carbonation topped off with a nice khaki head , lots of , lacing with this too	00000000000000000000000
1	a : hazy gold , plenty of lacing , and a head that lasts forever .	0000000000000000
1	a : aggressive pour yields 1 finger of good-looking head with good retention . reddish-brown and luminescent liquid . beautiful !	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : straw yellow with 1 finger of head that fades to a thin cap .	0000000000000000
1	a : pours a lovely amber that is actually quite clear . shifts between ruby red and golden straw depending on the light . big fluffy eggshell head . above average retention . leaves some lace .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : virtually opaque blackness with a two-finger mixed bubble tan head that holds on well . decent lacing .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : horrible head retention ; looks just like soda . clear golden color .	000000000000000
0	a : drank from the can but have seen one poured . very light , light color with no head . lots of carbonation .	0000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this certainly is a most impressive academical pour : thick , juice-like coating , with fizzled deposits lifting atop , and sliding to and fro from the rimming of the snifter . was a tulip recommended ? maybe , maybe , maybe ... also , there were floating minerals pedaled to the bottom , a very dreary yeast sediment that 's hard not to appreciatively glance at continuously all throughout the session . when i peered up at the stemware 's bulbous cylindrical midsection , it looked very much like ice particles awash in the way of a gigantic docking-ship en from england to greenland . a greenway , as it were . damned vikings ...	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a beautiful opaque almost black color with a thick thick creamy beige/brown head . this magnificent head fades from 3 fingers to 1cm creamy cap and lasts for the duration of the beer . the lacing is simply pasted the side of the glass . nitro may be gimmicky , but it sure does look nice .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark brown with hints of red in the tan head .	000000000000000
0	a : clear hold colour . thin head without cream . sm : clean light scent of barley , typical of cask ales but not indicative of quality . i 'm of the opinion that beeradvocate vastly overrates smell , especially in the case of cask ales .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a clear yellow with subtle head . reminds me of something plain , but we 'll see .	000000000000000000000
0	appearance : it pours a very pale shade of yellow with a thin white head that quickly fades out .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : clearish amber in color , no head or lacing .	000000000000
0	appearance : pours a clear golden yellow color with a one finger head . no lacing develops . several carbonation bubbles slowly rise from the glass bottom .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the cask version is better in all ways except here . the nectar i am used to shines in a way that no other beer does . the casked version had a haze to it that would not have bothered me with any other beer . it was darker than other versions , almost a light brown color . it was served to me with a perfect white frothy head .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : nice rich amber color with a decent head .	00000000000
1	a : the appearance is phenomenal : a semi-hazy orange hue topped with a fluffy , steamed-milk quality head that laces the shit out of the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a gorgeous reddish amber with just a layer of off white head and great retention .	0000000000000000000
1	a : its been said before , duvel has maybe the best pour in the beer world . gigantic fluffy head that sticks around forever , but somehow does n't get in the way of your drinking , when you tip the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dark mahogany with about a finger of beige head that fades into a very thin ring with little lacing .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : yellow-gold , slightly cloudy , no head .	0000000000
0	a : pumpkin colored with not much head to it . typical for the beer type and flavor .	0000000000000000000
1	a : pours hazy golden copper , 2 finger frothy white head that slowly dissipates . good lacing	000000000000000000
0	a : orangish brown . definitely darker than most hefes . highly carbonated as it should be . nice cloudiness . the head is soft , large and fluffy , but it unfortunately dies fast . overall , this does n't look like a typical hefe . darker in color and the head dies too fast .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a light coppery colour , more orange than red in my opinion : akin to your favourite pumpkin ales . off-white head that takes on a bit of the orange colour itself ; poured a thicker head than expected , but dissipated quickly , leaving only thin cover to shield what was beneath . impressive staying power for the beer lace .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : really dark brown and rather opaque . i could n't get a good head ( about one finger ) , and not good retention of that either . head is light brown in color . decent amount of lacing . there is a bunch of variable sized crap throughout all layers of the brew . 4.5	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy orange , just like any typically good hefe . pours a rather small two finger head that is sort of creamy , though not as creamy as some of the german-made hefes . the head quickly reduces to a single finger . lacing and head retention are poor for a hefeweizen . the head soon dissipates to a pitiful cap .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : 1 finger of dense light brown head with good retention . nearly opaque dark brown liquid .	0000000000000000000
0	a : thin tan foam that quickly fell into the beer . beer is black as night without a moon .	000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a very good looking deep red/light brown color . like red rust . lots of head , too much for the style in my opinion . leaves nice lacing . very clear .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : looked very much like a mix between a flanders red and a lambic . minimal slightly off white head .	0000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very pale straw color . lots of white creamy head and high carbonation ( bubbles ) .	0000000000000000000
1	appearance : it 's a looker , with a huge head sitting atop the clear amber liquid ; great retention and lacing	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : brown , color of the bottle from which it was poured , tan head which lingered for approximately thirty seconds . decent lacing . not very carbonated .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : light fizzy almost non-existant head over a hazy pale yellow dark murky dirty water colored beer . n : nose is light , some light malts , little sour mash aroma , tangy light fruits , some lemon peel .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : murky red-brown ale with mountainous foamy head with numerous clumps floating .	00000000000000
0	appearance : crystal clear golden lager . off white quickly dissipating head .	0000000000000
1	a : super pitch black with a humongous mocha colored head 2 inches thick that fades slowly . perfect !	00000000000000000000
0	a : poured a somewhat flat brown with a ring of carbonation around the side of the glass and no `` islands '' . clean and clear .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : nice looking bottle ... but that is about all that seems to be left of this . pours almost black with some golden , yellowish highlights around the edges . absolutely no head whatsoever . the inside of the bottle held onto a dark sludge ... it covered the sides and bottom . when rinsing the bottle , the first pour of water came out black .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : three finger head of off-pink vomit colour ( really , it 's fucking uncanny ) , terrible retention , and no cream . colour is a nontransparent hazy red . horrible appearance all around . sm : vomit and tomato puree , with perchance some light grapefruit . this is one of the worst aromas i 've ever encountered . and it 's moderately strong to boot .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : orange/bronze , very clear , tight yellowish/tan head that has no staying power .	0000000000000000
0	appearance : poured a clean light straw yellow . two fingers of white head developed and slowly dissipated to leave a nice foamy cap ... which then dissipated to a ring around the edge .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : average , clear , pale golden lager la the look of budweiser or pilsner urquell .	000000000000000000
1	a : very dark , hazy ruby brown ( almost looks like apple butter ) color with a massive , fluffy rocking tan head that has nice retention , slowly dissipating to a thick film . thick , clumpy lacing coats the inside of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a gusher upon carefully opening , we 're left with a clouded , darkened amber body with , despite the initial active , mess-making carbonation , only a very thin , whitish head .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : piss in a glass . thick white head . i ca n't say anything better and maintain integrity .	000000000000000000000

1	a : the first pour produces a clear straw-colored body with gold highlights . has generous effervescence that results in 3 '' of head with nearly 10 minutes of retention , receding into a half-inch foam top that leaves substantial sticky lacing down the glass . absolutely gorgeous . unfortunately , the second pour captured all the sediment , resulting in the same appearance , but cloudy .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dark brown in the snifter , with an inch of tan head . retention is moderate ; the foam collapses over a minute into a thin film on the brew and a nice collar around the edge . no lacing that sticks , but it leaves nice sheets during each swig . as the beer recedes in the glass , it becomes evident that the beer is actually a clear brown with ruby highlights ; when there 's about 1.5 '' left , i can see right through it . pretty lame for an imperial stout .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : very pale yellow liquid with zero head retention and lacing , and a few coarse bubbles all coming off the bottom of the glass at once . i am serving this beer cold , rather than cool , and it 's a chilly autumn night here in canberra . the only thing kind of like a head is this whitish scum on the top of the water . ok , it 's fine bubbles , not something gross , but still i 'm not giving this a good mark for appearance . the bottle is kind of attractive , what with the blue and red . still not too good though .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a transparent dull gold into a snifter . there is no head at all , but weird , slanted carbonation bubbles streaked up the glass and took awhile to lift . said bubbles move quickly to the top of the beer . there is no lacing at all and the beer looks more like a sparkling wine than a beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours a body as black as motor oil with a surprisingly dark brown ( like an aero chocolate bar ) bordering almost on a light black head . huge and thick that lasts a long time . very impressive .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : bright clear yellow that goes hazy as my glass widens at the hop . very active carbonation fails to hold a head ( at times a very thin collar ) . a careful pour leaves behind dark sediment . flavor : soft wheat , mild sweetness , a bit of the bubblegum which gives this a nice character . there is also a light grassy hop deep in the taste but no real bitter to speak of . the tastes are well blended and complete .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a very , very pale orange . completely transparent . 1 finger pearl white rocky head that remains a thick skim on the brew . 1 ring of fluffy lacing at the top and a pebble here and there on the way down .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pitch black , with a slight twinge of deep mahogany around the edges . though for a saison , it seems remarkably clear with very little sediment .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : caramel light brown in color , good head retention and medium lacing . off white head of foam .	000000000000000000000
0	a : one finger white head dissipates quickly , leaving almost no trace at all either on the glass or in the beer . it 's always disappointing to see a thick three-fingers of head in pictures on the brewer 's website , and then experiencing the exact opposite . color is orange with a hazy , unfiltered presence . there is a slight , almost invisible tint of purple and a few floating particles here and there , probably from the raspberry puree .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : poured into a standard pint glass . black , when held to the light , still pretty darn dark , maybe with better lighting this may be reddish , but held to a 60 watt light bulb , still dark . big tan head , at least 2 inches . had to stop the pour , then finish . head lingered well into the first few sips , lacing down the glass to the finish .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : a very dense , dark , chocolate brown head rises to about the width of a finger . it really takes it 's time to fade , but once it does there are only a few blotches left . the beer itself is pitch black , and only a sliver of dark brown is detectable when held up to the light . a ring of foam clings to the inside of the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : crisp and clear golden amber ... the glass was poured quite high , so the head spilled over the rim of the glass , and did n't leave much behind . a thin little collar remains behind .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : golden apple-juicy amber with a smooth , fluffy , white head and fair retention . thin flecks of hops are visible in slowly swirling suspension . you can tell this one 's gon na be hoppy .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark black once the nitrogen bubbles settle . watching this beer settle is beautiful in itself . the brown cloud sweeping up ward towards an always hearty head .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : no head , gold orange color with slight haze	00000000000

1	appearance : pours with 1 1/2 inches of creamy , tan head that settles slowly to a thin layer of foam with a ton of lacing . the beer itslef is a beautiful ruby color .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pour with a medium sized head that dissipates before your eyes . lacing is non existent except for thin wisps here and there . oonly way to get a lacing out of this is to use an etched glass , but thats cheating if the beer does n't start with a good head is n't it ? 100 % clear and no sediment , unusual for a belgian ale as they are usually bottle fermented . color is golden .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : poured from the can into my shorts pint glass , the beer is is clear , vibrant light gold color with a massive , foamy 2 inches worth of head . the retention is pretty good , and i can see thick chunks of lacing clinging to the sides of the glass . lookin good .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : very nice orange-yellow color , very cloudy , with a great two-finger lasting , thick head , which left good lacing . s/t : light and lemony-fresh with a good spiciness provided by the yeast , almost to a rye-like degree , along with some possible cloves . a surprisingly solid caramel-like malt backbone . gets a bit astringent in time , though .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : not a good start . poured a bright , golden yellow that has some orange tints to it when the light hits it . ca n't get head of this bitch to save my life . i pour vigoursly and i get maybe half a finger , but zero retention . this fades faster than a 24 hour whore who is out of coke . lame , very lame . there is zero haze to this beer and jst a bit of carbonation bubbles flowing in the glass . moving on .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : ah yes , here it is : the king of beers . well , it does n't look like the king of beers . there was something like a foam that formed when i poured this beer , but then it dissipated into nothingness . there is n't even lacing around the top to make this beer look like beer . basically , i 've got yellow soda water .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pour is a dark brown , but not deep dark brown near black like coffee , and this one shows plenty of ruby highlights when held up to the light ; starts with a 2 finger light tan head with decent retention ; the body shows strong carbonation through the highlights ; head eventually fades to a full , but very uneven cap with thick lumps on the side ; fair lacing is left on the sides of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : very pale yellow ; small head that faded fast . looks like your average run of the mill adjunct light beer , and this is the king of them .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : deep yellow golden orange . very opaque and next to no carbonation evident . pours a large fluffy white head that is pretty persistent . eventually levels out to nothing and leaves no lacing . looks great at the beginning , but relatively flat by the end , unfortunately .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : cloudy orange and gold body with off-white head which recedes to leave sticky lacing . looks more of a hefeweizen than an ipa . residual hops has got something to do this .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : light golden ale with a single finger of fine white foam falls to a blank , reflecting surface . no lacing . hazy as expected .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : it is a vibrant red with a thick head	00000000000
1	a : i have to give guinness credit that this is one of the most striking pours i have ever seen . dark brown clouds billow downwards between a creamy head and a jet black body .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this beer pours a dark caramel/ hazelnut hue with a pillowy off-white head that rose up very vigorously on an easy pour . many columns of beading floating rapidly to the top of my tall weizen glass . minimal amount of laceing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a hazy , light orange , not gold as i expected , with a thick great white head , which is legitimate in height with great retention all through the drink , great lacing as well , the higher alcohol brew just coats the glass when drunk , certainly a great looking beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a very light yellow color with a 1/4 '' head that breaks apart immediately . plenty of carbonation bubbles rise to the surface .	000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : cloudy golden color with bits floating around . had to double check the label to see if this was a non-filtered beer . it does n't specify so i 'm a little confused . head is white and foamy . not the best head retention . decent lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours golden with an enormous white creamy head that sinks into fantastic lacings .	0000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a charred wood color coming off deep brown at the top and edges but black through the middle . looking through the sides the beer appears to pour with good clarity . next to no head forms with even a moderate pour . some bubbles form along the rim of the glass , but after a few minutes these have all faded to nothing . no lacing . flavor : a smack of vanilla coats the tongue at first before a very strong bourbon and brandy flavor kicks in . if i knew more about these liquors i could describe it better , but there 's something more going on here than just bourbon oak . high alcoholic spice becomes present in the middle and toward the finish where you 'll also find some dark fruit playing into the mix . finishes with stickiness on the tongue and lingering vanilla .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : copper , slightly hazy , nice small-bubbled head with decent retention and good lacing .	00000000000000000
1	appearance : this is easily the largest most rapidly expanding head i have seen , ever . explosive even . other than that , pours a dense , cloudy orangey bronze with lots of sediment and bubbles constantly streaming up .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : lovely to behold , with a massive head atop the liquid and plenty of lacing	00000000000000000
0	appearance : free pour yields a quarter inch fizzy white head that dissipates immediately . pours a semi-translucent dark red orange and leaves occasional short lived spots of lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a very clear , deep golden pumpkin orange . a few streams of fine bubbles are present . very large head and decent retention . soapy , glittery lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : very hazy , ruddy caramel color . thin head that dissipated quickly ( the bottle poured very smoothly , so perhaps it was n't agitated enough ) .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : there was a little foam over after uncapping this beer , a solid centimeter of frothy head on a medium pour , deep gold - 3.00 ,	00000000000000000000000000000

1	a : clear , light honeyed amber color with over one finger of persistent white foam head . thick sheeting lace remains on the glass . numerous rays of bubbles rise energetically in the column .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : tenaciously-driven : illustriously tenebrous , and holds its weight solidly ; looks like third-world oil ... its head is reassuring and does n't have too much of an outward flow . impressive . mighty-fine lace ; takes a good while for the caramel-coloured froth-head to finally settle back in place , but when it does its vainglory still sits well out of reach in the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : the body has good clarity and a nice golden color . it builds up a tall white head full of big loosely packed bubbles that quickly fade out . this only makes for a very little spotty lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a very small tan head that quickly disappears into a thin wispy film . colour is an opaque dark brown , bistre perhaps , with very little carbonation . a bit of a film stays to the end and leaves some lacing down the glass . unfortunately the head is a little too average .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : odd yellow color reminds me of weak urine . foam is mediocre and non durable . forgettable appearance , and this is probably the best part of this beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a non existent head after trying a hard pour . there is some foamy ivory rings around the glass trying to be a head . the color of the beer is dark mahogany color to almost opaque . the clarity of the beer is opaque .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : poured from a 750 ml bottle into a stein . gold with about 2 fingers of fluffy head .	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours almost perfectly clear with a white head of medium sized bubbles . the head was maintained pretty well by quite a few bubbles rising . there was some light lacing on the glass after drinking .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pale yellow , nearly straw in color . the beer pours with a very wimpy head which subsides to nothing in literally a matter of seconds .	00000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a light straw color ; no head , no lacing	0000000000000

1	a : beautiful . murky brown with a creamy white head and lots of lacing . i 'm a sucker for the goblets . s +	00000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pouring this beer for the first time was amazing . the whole glass turned into a thick head . and i when say thick i mean like cool whip thick . it looked wonderful and gave me an immediate appetite . the head was long lasting , slow to fade , and laced the glass perfectly . the lace was about 1/8 '' over the beer through out my entire sample . it did not fade , break up or go away . i covered my beer and the edges of the glass was something to admire . the beer had a rich gold color with the color deepening as it neared the center . my notes say , `` translucent beauty . '' a light carbonation bubbled through the entire beer and just made it look like what i imagine a beer is suppose to look like . for that reason i gave it a 5 . even in the wrong glass it was picture perfect .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours very clear . it is a light mahogany to dark honey color and boasts a frothy cap of off-white foamy head . this beer looks just amazing !	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured jet black with great carbonation leaving a big brown cap and lots of bubbles	00000000000000000
0	a : ugliest bottle i 've ever seen , and a very unatractive beer which pours an average piss color .	000000000000000000000
0	appearance : flat , thin brown . no head , minimal carbonation that faded to just plain flat quickly . flavor : maybe . to be fair , what you can taste is enjoyable . toasted malt , hops in fair balance , with a finish that is , well , it tastes like budweiser . they must use some of the same ingredients , possibly the yeast and hops .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : jet black and opaque . pours a thin head that quickly disappears . leaves no lacing on the side .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : a slow pour yielded a huge mocha head body is black as night .	0000000000000000
0	a : pours dark brown with no real head formation and only a ring of tan foam with a mirrored center . no lace .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : a hazy yellow-beige , rock and roll head with lots of lacing , almost creamy head left on sides of glass . the haze is a little deep , but the head is something to behold .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : glass was slid in front of me by the bartender , causing the cascading head to rock back and forth until it had completely settled . the body is a hazy amber , and shows suspended sediment within . the head might be the nicest i 've ever seen on a cask ale ( keep in mind that this is only my forth cask ale ) . it 's super tight and creamy , stands 1.5 fingers tall , and drags a blanket of lace down the entire cylinder . oh yeah , and the retention is fantastic : it holds it 's 1.5 finger height for the entire session . excellent !	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a straw light color with little to no visible carbonation .	00000000000000
1	a : infinium 's cork pops much the same as a champagne does . it displays exceptionally fine bubbles that race from the foot to head . the body is crystal clear , and displays a gentle copper color .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy golden-orange . bubbly two-finger white head . decent retention , delicate lacing forms rings on the glass . retention could be better considering all the adjuncts used in this beer ( wheat , oats , rye ) .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pale yellow , small head , very slight haze .	000000000000
1	a : slightly cloudy , light orange/peach color . thick , fluffy head with great retention .	00000000000000000
1	a : pours super dark nearly opaque with a beautiful ruby color when held in the light . a really nice two finger creamy tan head . the lacing was fairly sparse in the end with most of it toward the top of the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this beer pours jet black with slight , and i mean slight dark brown hues on the edges in the light . the pour came with about 2-3 fingers worth of dark mocha brown head . left some lacing on the side of the glass . a great looking beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dark gold color , thin white head quickly dissolves , no lacing on glass .	00000000000000000
1	a : light sparkling yellow with a look that did not come across as bottle conditioned . creamy , rocky , milkshake head on the golden dustiness . it lasted long and the lacing was like soap suds .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : clear deep mahogany brown in color , with a large tan head , excellent lacing , and moderate carbonation .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : a huge , tight head impressively crests the beer , gently churning , but never quite collapsing . a dark tan , it tops a much darker brown beer , completely opaque . good lacing . with this creamy monster of a head , occasional bubbles , and a richly-coloured impenetrable beer , appearances do n't get much better than this .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : bottle nearly exploded taking the top off ! 1st pour yielded half a pint of foam , understandably . subsequent pours yielded 1 '' yellow tinted white head . leaves thick , intact , sparkling lacing virtually all the way down . appearance score takes a hit for dowsing me .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pale straw color , fizzy white head .	0000000000
0	appearance : obsidian color , absolutely no head ( i actually thought it was completely flat at first ) , good clarity	0000000000000000000000
0	appearance : mostly clear ( you can almost see your fingerprints through the glass but not quite ) golden body . the thin white head that forms as you pour it vanishes almost instantly . obviously , there 's no lacing left behind when there 's no head to leave it . as this is probably consumed from the can 99.9 % of the time i doubt it matters .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a cloudy yellow color . well carbonated . 1 finger of head , which lasts a while .	00000000000000000000
1	a : pour an incredible creamy peach . it reminds me of a melted orange-creamsicle . it has a beautiful could haze to it and there is a thin white head . the lacing is great.this beer hangs onto the glass for dear life .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a dark crimson beauty with a milk coffee colored head that leaves nice lacing while receding ever so slowly .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : dark brown with solid finger of tan colored foam , settles into a thick ring with strong lacing that forms a full ring around the glass and holds its ground throughout . a good looking brew , off to a good start .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured with a large , extremely frothy white head ... this baby stuck around for minutes on end before it finally started to fade away , leaving thick lacing on the glass . body is a dark copper color and clear .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : the liquid is straw-coloured and has an airy white head with not much lacing going on .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : hazy brownish red with a 1 '' head . the head is off white and lasts a short bit , with some lacing on the sides of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : hazy pale orange . inch of head . great lace , great retention .	0000000000000000
0	a : pours a light amber with an average white head , a little lighter than i expected .	0000000000000000000
1	appearance : absolutely beautiful to watch , and makes you anticipate what you are about to drink . a very thick 3 finger head , and the very unique waves that cascade down the glass like waves in the ocean . the bubbles flowing downward are very unique also , and a treat for the eyes .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured motor-oil thick and black into my bruery tulip glass . what was disappointing was the lack of head and lacing , but i can contribute some of that to the growler . a few quick swirls develop a head , but the retention was mild at best .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured into a snifter , this appears dark brown but can be seen through when held to direct light . a deep violet is apparent when this is done . a half glass of dust brown head builds with a violent pour . good lacing considering what this is . good legs cement a perfect score here . 5/5	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured a fruit punch red with pink highlights with a thin head and little lacing on the glass .	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : gold with a red tint and a nice white foamy head .	00000000000000
0	appearance : poured from a can into a hoegaarden pint glass in low altitude galway , ireland , on october 25th , 2010 . pours a clear bright yellow with a pathetic two finger head that appears thin and without cream . at least it does n't look overcarbonated .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy unfiltered orange brown color . could not get a good head on this not matter how hard i tried . that said , not much retention or lacing . 4.5	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear ruby body in the glass . it 's flat , no carbonation .	000000000000000000
1	a : ultra light straw color in body , hazy , bubbles everywhere . three finger white head . attractive..	00000000000000000000
0	a : light pale copper . fizzy head that comes down to almost nothing soon after a normal pour .	00000000000000000000
0	a : yellow , like urine .	0000000
0	appearance : 3 |	0000
1	a : an absolutely huge foamy , densely packed head . nearly perfect orange-gold . cloudy .	00000000000000000
0	a : brownish opaque color . no head ... boo . i would say the color is not inviting : p	000000000000000000000
1	a : deep black and opaque , nice tan foamy 2-finger head . great head retention and great lacing . beautiful .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : dark orange amber , nearly opaque , hazy , clearly unfiltered , tan head	0000000000000000
0	appearance : crystal clear , light gold in colour with very little head -- just a very thin white foam lace .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a beautiful ruby red liquid with a soft pink head . nice constant carbonation in the middle of the glass keeps the head going till the end . the really nice part is that if you swirl the liquid around in the glass the head takes on different shades of red . a beautiful color overall .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark as night with a decent tan head .	00000000000
0	a : the first thing i noticed about the beer is how loud the head was . that tan head very loudly crackles away to nothing , leaving not a trace on top of the dark brown body . however , when that beer is held up against a strong light , we can see that the body 's color is more accurately described as a deep , deep red with slight orange hues throughout .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : very inviting appearance , beautiful mocha head , jet black , lace sticks to glass very nicely .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a cloudy lemon juice color with what turns out to be a modest head ( although it foamed out of the bottle initially ) ; a few dots of lace	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear mahogany with a finger of off-white head that recedes into a thin ring with no lacing .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : mahogany color with small foamy head that dissipates quickly .	000000000000
1	a : super high head -- amazing ; pours cloudy dark orange	000000000000
0	a : pours a crytal clear new penny copper , maybe even a bit lighter than that , one of the lighter ipas i 've seen in a while . a three quarter inch head settles nicely on top of the beer and is supported by a few thin ropes of carbonation bubbling up from the laser etchings below . head fades to a thickish ring and leaves minimal lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : fantastic . a hard pour yielded a nice tan head , sitting atop a viscous , black concoction . decent lacing .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear golden-amber body with a steady column of carbonation leading up to a perfectly lofty head of frothy bright-white foam . it presents the perfect image in the duvel tulip , with the initial beer/head line falling right in the middle of the logo . awesome .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark brown color but more the color of mahogany , with some red hues . the head is very small and is eggshell white .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : very little head that dissipated immediatley . not a lot of carbonation either , typical lager hue .	00000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark opaque brown with a thick , dense tan head . the head retains very well and leaves quite a bit of lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a golden colour , with very slight reds . think head which dissolves to a thin lacing rather quickly .	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a one finger ivory head that is foamy and creamy with some retention . the head is leaving some lacing on the glass . the color of the beer is medium amber color with orange highlights . the clarity of the beer is hazy . there is some yeast floating in the beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear , apple cider colored body . a 1/2 '' fizzy bubbly head drops to nothing in just a few seconds . no lacing is left behind .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a dark brown with nearly no head even with a vigorous pour . leaves virtually no lacing whatsoever . i 'm not impressed .	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a light copper color with a massive head that comes to rest as a thick blanket of foam .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : amber , decent head	000000
0	appearance : drank straight from the 12 oz . can . the label assures me that `` this is the original pbr beer . '' i do n't think i had any doubts to begin with hahaha ... the label also declares that pbr was `` selected as america 's best in 1893 . '' 114 years later , i doubt that 's still the case , but here goes ...	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pale yellow color with little to no head and minimal lacing .	00000000000000
0	appearance : a half finger head that is white and has some foamy head . the head is a light straw color . the beer has some effervescence . the body of the beer is clear .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark brown body with a suprisingly effervescent tan head , rising to 2 '' in height and sticking around a while .	00000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : great looking beer . nice , topographical head appearance that is dense , uniform , and leaves a good bit of lacing on my clean glass ( hear that ? ! ? ! clean glass ... ) anyway , beer itself is hazy orange . interesting phenomenon : when i drank about half of the beer a very dense formation of creamy head formed in the center of the beer forming an almost perfect circle .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a lovely ruby tinted copper , plenty of bubbles rising from the glass , full just off white head . looks great .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : one finger of beige head over a beautiful mahogany and amber body . sticky lace adorns the glass and a head retains magnificently throughout the session .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear copper/amber color . poured a 2 finger light tan head with good retention settling to a 1 finger cap . light , inconsistent lacing . lightly decanted .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : copper brownish , and relatively translucent . a very appealing stream of frothy bubbles dancing on top .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : unfortunately not too much head on it , and the lacing does n't seem to be sticking very well . and i suppose the color is n't the most intriguing either , actually . not awful , but i expected a bit more .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours with a very short lasting head , no lacing just a quick showing then gone . body is brown a touch cloudy , with a light red hue when held to the light .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : in my brief experience with them , tommyknocker beers either have a great head , or none at all . this one had the later . after a quick blip of seltzer fizz , i had nothing more than a thin ring around the edge of the beer . beep gold color has good clarity and very active bubbles , however .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a brilliant copper ; pristine clarity ; huge , foamy , three-fingered head ; excellent retention -- at least one of those fingers made it down to the bottom of my 20oz . pint glass ; heavy , heavy sheet lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pale yellow as far as i can tell . deduction for bragging about being made with rice on the can 's label .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours out a murky brown , with bits of yeast . there is also a film of yeast left on top of the beer when the head settles . small , light brown head that faded quickly .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : golden-yeasty colour , no head so no head retention .	000000000000
0	a : poured a reddish/amber color , with a very thin head , and little lacing .	00000000000000000
0	a : pours a slightly hazed radiant yellow brown . two fingers of fizzy white head die off quickly like a can of coke . 4.0	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : this pours out a syrupy liquid . the colors are brown , red and orange . it varies depending on how much light is hitting it . the body is slightly hazy with minimal carbonation movement flowing . the body is lighter than i expected , you can see throw and light gets through the hazy body . the pour does n't seem like there will be a head at all to form , but it slowly builds a very thin , white , bubbled ring . very small and minimal .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark brown brew , ca n't see through it at all . has a healthy head at the initial pour of foamy off white that reduces to something a bit thinner but sticks around for the entire time . lacing is more like a thin layer of foam that sticks to the side of the glass . very nice .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pale straw-yellow , crystal-clear body with a fizzy bright-white head that recedes quickly and leaves no lacing .	00000000000000000000
1	appearance : very impressive . gorgeous dark brown with a subtle red hue if held to light . contrasted nicely by the off white head that tops the brew . if poured fairly vigorously , a terrific head will develop . the surface tension of the head allows it to cling to the glass and lace out perfectly atop the beer . the carbonation is just enough to promote lacing without disturbing the beautiful islands of foam . too bad the rest of the beer is not as divine .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : it comes in a clear bottle and is a dark amber colour ; it pours the same with a one finger white head with webby lacing . this is the best looking beer ever .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : slightly cloudy with a greenish tint in an otherwise pale , yellow beer . no head at all , which translated to almost no lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured a caramelly mahogany body with a finger of off-white head . retention is pretty short , and the head is mostly gone by the time the bartender gets it to me .	00000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : as soon as the waiter brought this beer to the table i looked at it and thought i was going to regret this one ... opaque straw in color , 2 finger white head that leaves little retention ... i thought this beer was going to be very watery	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : brilliantly clear honey colored body . thanks to the widget , the head is amazingly dense , creamy , and measures a full two fingers . great fun to pour and watch with interesting little bubbles that cling to the glass . i could watch this all day , not quite as cool as the guinness cascade , but certainly worth the cost of admission . even after the head settles , this is an exceptionally pretty beer . the head rides all the way down to the bottom of the glass , leaving sudsy lacing behind .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : no head , no lace , dark dark brown in color	0000000000000
0	appearance : a nice , deep amber color , but looks much lighter than most bocks . has a pretty nice head- not too thick , but by no means thin- that dissipates just right- not too fast , not too slow .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : dark brown , almost opaque , brew with dark tan wispy head . little carbonation in the body .	000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a black body with tan head . no retention or lace .	000000000000000
0	a : the color of maple syrup , though wholly transluscent and relatively light at 23 srm . one inch head vanishes within a minute to nothing . beyond the appealing color , little other visual fulfillment to be had .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a really nice light golden color , almost straw like . provides nice white foam head with decent retention . provides ample lacing down the sides . this is what a pils should look like .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : medium amber with orange hues . sticky off white head . good retention and a slight amount of lacing .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy copper , about half an inch worth of cream colored head , sticky gobs of lacing , nice looking beer minus the big chunks of sediment in the bottom , quite noticeable and very out of place for the style , but still a good looking beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : very pale straw color , cloudy with off-white edges . no head retention at all .	000000000000000000

1	a : pours a light gold color , thin , quickly thinning head . lacing throughout the pint .	0000000000000000000
1	a : incredible look to this one . pours a thick black with a duvel-esque dark tan head which lasts for ages and settles down to a permanent half-finger at the top of the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : amber in color , nice white head , great retention .	0000000000000
1	a : pours a hazy golen color with a huge white ( 2+ fingers worth ) head with lots of lively carbonation . huge , thick lines of lacing cling to glass long after the liquid goodness has disappeared below .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours red with no head , not even a smattering of bubbles . nice colour .	000000000000000000

0	a : pours into the glass looking like flat , generic `` cola '' . a few bubbles and a tiny tan head pop up before becoming absolutely still again . no lace . looks like the cuyahoga river around the time that it caught fire .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured a muddy/cloudy brown red color , little to no head , no lacing .	00000000000000000

0	a : underwhelming appearance ; a murky garnet-orange . no head . no lace . an oily sheen . a little unfair to judge appearance on such an odd beer , but i feel a '3 ' is justified , perhaps even generous .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : very pale and light straw in color , not much head and it dissipated quickly .	000000000000000000
0	a : i should preface this by saying that hefeweizens in a weizen glass is the greatest looking beer in the world to me . that being said , this one falls short . the pour is a hazy golden color with a billowing two finger head that dissipates quickly and does not lace very well .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : deep copper color with rosy hues , lots of sediment in bottle ( about 3/4 of an inch )	000000000000000000000

1	a : cloudy and orange-amber in color with a beautiful 2-finger head of pillowy tan foam . oily hop resins are very apparent in suspension . head shows great retention and leaves sticky lacing trails all the way down the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured like a chocolate milkshake from the nitro can . as the famous cascade of bubbles rose the beer settled to deep black that was not completely opaque . a thick , creamy head sat on top throughout the pint .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : standard pour yields a half finger fine , light coffee colored head with poor retention . beer is a clear , opaque black . lacing is non-existant though there 's some decent legs . below average .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a nice straw yellow with a 3 finger puffy head . great look to a hefeweizen .	00000000000000000000

1	appearance : a monster 3 finger dark tan head that is foamy and creamy . the body of the beer is jet black . there is effervescence on the side of the beer . there is no clarity in the beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a cloudy apricot with a big belgian head that retains and laces with the best	000000000000000000
1	a : dark copper body that separates quickly from a thick creamy off-white head .	000000000000000
1	a : really nice cloudy orangish gold . looks like a really great heff . minimal amount of white head . some lacing .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a cloudy burnt orange , with a small white head which is frankly dissapointing for a wheat beer , fair head retention , no lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a cloudy orangish color , small white head , no lacing observed .	0000000000000000
0	a : the only thing that might be lighter and fizzier is urinating after the 3rd or 4th one ( sorry to be so crude , but i thought it to be true ) . that said :	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pitch black with thin caramel brown head .	0000000000
1	a : brilliant bright white head with excellent lacing . meringue head sits atop honey golden body .	000000000000000000
0	a : yep , yellow water is a good description . then , as i usually do i take a sniff of the beer . b : wow , smells sweet , and chock full of corn . ok , everyone else is on their 3rd cup , time to try it	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : a good four fingers of nice resilient foamy head . surprisingly clear for a hef . slight hazy yellow .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : deep copper/amber color . really wonderful when held up to the light . creamy white head with less than 1/2 fingers .	000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : one finger of light tan lacing falls quickly . dark brown body , with some clear visibility around the edges . flavor : wow ... something went horribly wrong with this one . tastes like some kind of cleaning solution ( mop & glo ? , though i 've admittedly never imbibed it ) up front and then blood . once the malt starts showing up , the flavor is as if someone cut the beer with some water , and squeezed-in few drops of lemon juice .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a nicely hazy , golden-amber body with a big white head that features decent retention and lacing . lo an behold , there 's even some sediment at the bottom of the bottle . not much wrong with the way it looks .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a deep black syrup that seems to stick to the glass ( with a gentle swirl or after a sip ) .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : crystal clear orange with a white head that has large formed bubbles .	000000000000000
0	appearance : small head that disappeared quickly , mildly cloudy , with not too much action going on inside my glass .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : it 's black . black as hell to be exact . the head is frothy and fairly thick . a good inch of cream colored love on top .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : very light golden orangish color , you could definitely see through it . not much head , but a nice thin lacing throughout the glass . tons and tons of carbonation bubbles flow nicely to the top .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : redder than rubies , with barely any bubbles , they were quite soapy and frail , but quite normal for this style , methinks .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : translucent orange/red in color . big head upon pour that falls quickly . lots of lacing left over . presence of sediment and `` floaties '' really take away from what would otherwise be a very sexy beer . floaties are rather large . 4.5	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a cloudy golden color with a slight orange hue . provides a big frothy white foam head that is long lasting . provides decent lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured into a nonic pint glass . semi-vigorous pour reveals a deep brown ( nearly black ) opaque brew with a beautifully reverse-cascading two-finger head of frothy espresso-colored foam . the head seems to want to linger forever , making the presentation extremely appealing and inviting . a fine lace clings to the glass as the head slowly recedes to a thick cap . flawless .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : big billowy fluffy ivory-colored head , 3 '' in height . in a couple minutes it settles from within to a 1/4 '' cake , then eventually to a thin whispy layer . minimal lace at first , then becoming more generous as it warms .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a light golden body , with decent carbonation holds a white head with nice lacing and good head retention .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : nice clear golden color . lace on the glass ran away relatively fast . great looking head at first that dissipated faster than expected .	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : black color . two fingers of creamy light brown head . retention is good and plenty of lacing is left . i 'm impressed so far . 2.5	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : purs a clear copper color with clingy carbonation and a bubbly head . no lacing .	000000000000000000
1	appearance : dark red , like a sherry with a crown of lace .	00000000000000
0	appearance : this beer comes in bottles . after pouring this beer into a clear glass , i noticed that it had an orange/amber colour with a nice amount of carbonation and a short head . later on there was a very small amount of noticable lacing on the glass . not the best i have seen .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours an absolutely massive cream colored orange-tinged head beneath a hazy orange-copper body . literally , the head was sticking 4 1/2 inches out of the glass like a snow cone . when it finally receded it left tons of thick , sticky lacing on the glass and a solid 1/2 to 3/4 inch of foam retained atop the beer . looks great , i must say .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : thin foamy head that quickly dissipated into a fizz .	000000000000
0	appearance : dark brown in color , with not much head , probably due to snifter glass .	000000000000000000
1	a : the pour is just about black with a tan head on it .	000000000000000
1	a : oh yeah . pours a thick , dunkel brown/black . very slightly lighter on the edges . nice , creamy brown head that sticks around and to the sides . 5/5	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : hazy brick red pour with a sticky off-white cap . flavor : saltine crackers , biscuity , earthy hops , and some spicy floral flavors . a brush of alcohol but this flavor is really lacking . just a little malt and hops and really nothing else .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a one finger medium off-white head with good retention . a nice partially clear gamboge orange color with next to zero carbonation evident . head fades to a wisp and a thick ring around the edges . a bit of a wisp and ring remain to the end leaving a bit of lacing down the sides . average for the style .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear yet dull honey color . virtually no head , a few stray splotches of foam float on top . bottle label fits its style well- very 'classic ' and 'canadian ' feel to it .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured from a bottle a straw yellow with a thin white head .	000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark golden color with a fairly substantial bubbly white head that took its time reducing into a thin film that left a surprising amount of lacing down the glass . this beer was darker than i was expecting and actually looks good .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : golden straw color . slight chill haze . thin snow white head that disappears as quickly . minimal , if any lacing .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : caramel in colour , with tons of fluffy , slightly off-white head ! lots of retention and incredible lacing ! ( enough to make some stouts jealous ) ! exceptional . perfect .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : typical adjunct lager urine-yellow . a nice head bubbles up but disappears almost instantly leaving no lacing .	00000000000000000000
1	a : creepy gurgle sound from the bottle when i popped the cap . clank-clank from the nitro capsule . the body is n't nearly as black as i remember , more light a dark brown , with amber tones by the edge of the glass . 1/2 '' creme colored head holds on for a long time , some muddy brown colored curtains from the head falling back into the body . the lacing is very impressive , it coats everywhere with a thick creme curtain .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : not quite sure if it lives up to the `` triple hoppy '' tag on the bottle , but it is damn hoppy for sure . great aromatics that smell like a big ol ' bowl of fruit jambalaya . i get pineapples , peaches , oranges , grapefruit , and a squeeze of lemon . malt is there if you concentrate on it , but they take a backseat to the fireworks show put on by the hops .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : murky amberish orange with a thin white head . no lacing as you drink , but a good retention on the head .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : copper color , really small head , fully translucent , not a lot of lacing .	000000000000000000
0	appearance : a brilliant chestnut color , completely clear . head is nonexistent , save for a thin ring of bubbles .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy golden body with an over load of white fluffy head . there was way to much carbonation in this beer , i poured a bit , then it exploded into foam . lost half the beer and needed a major clean up . not impressed . retention and lacing is good though .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear copper-amber body with ( when served ) not much head on it . a moderate collar with some scattered lace are all that remain of the foam . no lace during sips .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : after pouring into a glass i was struck at how pale the color was and how effervescent it became . besides the clarity , the thin head also indicated a light bodied beer . it was quick to foam but also quick to settle leaving almost no webbing on the glass wall at all . as i was drinking , webbing never quite appeared on the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a nice pink/white head on top of a ruby red liquid . decent head retention with some good lacing .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : deep opaque black with light ruby edges . a large , rocky , and mocha-colored head composed of large , erratic bubbles settles slowly to a thin foamy covering , leaving some nice rings of lace in its wake . nice appearance .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : red to brown hue . poor head retention and a low brown finger of head .	000000000000000000
1	appearance : it comes in dark-amber to reddish colour , with very fine carbonation and milky-white , extre ... mely dense and thick beerhead which lasts throughout the drink . simply remarkable !	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : reddish , coppery gold , clear . nice 3-finger off-white head , and yes , lots of lacing on my bells glass . good amount of carbonation too .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : nice color for certain . very clingy foamy head ; about 1 inch after a typical pour . nice amber/pale melded color typical of style .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : deep brown but still transparent .	00000000
0	a : clear gold color with champagne-esqe bubbles with a decent sized head that does not stick to the glass .	000000000000000000000
1	a : the first time i saw this beer opened it was a room-temp gusher , so i popped this one right out of the fridge . an initially gentle pour soon shows that overcarbonation wo n't be an issue , and the final picture is a perfectly adequate finger of coarse tan foam atop a dark reddish-brown body . the head demonstrates reasonable retention but only spotty lace . not bad , but not especially great , either .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : like a pale orange . a thin and pale yellow-orange with a little head that goes away in the blink of an eye and leaves no laceing .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : big chunky , pillowy head . color is pale yellow . very cloudy . lacing looks more like a popcorn ceiling and stays around for about as long . flavor : dominate flavor is funk.. lemony fruit notes and light malt . tasted like someone dropped a sweet tart in the bottle . bitterness is medium-high .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the appearance is really fabulous . the beer is transparent and pale yellow , with pockets of carbonation bubbles throughout . the head is a gorgeous , white froth that lingers indefinitely .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : mahogony color with dark brown showing around the edges , thick brown head that retains for a good while , very nice lacing . a very good-looking beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : lots of frothy head leaving tons of lacing , sits atop a clear amber-brown beer .	000000000000000000
1	a : pours an attractive dark amber with 1 inch head . the head has decent retention and leaves a surprising amount of lacing .	0000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : bright topaz with a light yeasty haze . similar in color to a butterscotch candy . head is just barely off-white and does not retain well .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy amber color , no head of foam , i guess if the logo is the volcano popocateplet ;	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : served in an eight-ounce glass , comes with a great frothy white head , excellent retention ( at least for a barleywine ) and lacing . color is dark caramel , very opaque . looks are the winning part of this brew .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : nice red/ amber color , roasty brown head , and very cloudy .	000000000000000
0	a : clear slightly ruddy golden color with a two-finger fluffy white head . good retention and lacing . marred slightly by some small black floaters .	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a hazy canteloupe orange with an inch of off-white head . nice carbonation up the center of the glass . the head recedes into a collar around the drink and leaves lacing down the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours black body with a two finger off white head on top . has good retention and lacing . when back lite , has a deep ruby red color .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : barely a hiss when the cork pops . pours thick and black as hell . almost no head . at all . a rim of dark brown foam and some smaller floating bubbles is all there is . just a couple spots of lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : blah . thin body and thin head probably means thin flavor	0000000000000
1	a : vivacious golden rod color with thousands of scurrying bubbles vortexing too and fro . head is quite spectacular , full and creamy made up of tight off white bubbles . so far so good .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : * @ & % ! ! ! this thing is a gusher . why did i do it so close to the computer why oh why oh why oh why did i backup recently f*** me it 's on the keys now people are going to look at me funny when i 'm typing in a meeting and my keys are sticky crapcrapcrapcrap it looks like i 'm talking about fapping pours a glowing , murky reddish-amber body capped with tons of fluffy tan head . it just keeps coming and coming and- ... uh , anyway . i like head on a beer , but this is at the point where it 's absurdly overdone .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : stubble yellow , with a thin , fluffy white head that vanishes rapidly .	0000000000000000
1	appearance : pours an orange/ruby red that is very dark , but crystal clear . fine carbonation leads to a fluffy quarter inch of tight tan head , that has some decent staying power and leaves behind a nice lace .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : little to no head and i 'll be terribly surprised if any lacing develops . dainty yellow orange color body . there is hardly any visible carbonation . where 's my frothy never ending cap ? where 's the relentless effervescence ? while this brew is mildly attractive in it 's own right , the asylum is way off the mark in terms of tripel-like appearance .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a hazy orange color with 2-fingers of white head with holding power ! this beer in my glass was also lacing really well . very impressed so far .	00000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours into my new belgium globe glass a crystal clear copper gold with 2 fingers worth of fluffy white head on top . it drops slowly to a full cap with constant help of the nucleation sites in the glass . lacing comes in sheets creating a picture perfect ale .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : orangish/amberish/murky-light brownish color that is pretty hazy . tons of carbonation ripping up that creates a huge , rocky and very thick , light khaki head . nice sticky lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : crystal clear light amber color . head was initially about 1 1/2 inches and fluffy white , but dissipated quickly , leaving a scant layer of suds and no lacing . i hand washed this glass and rinsed it at least five times with hot water , so i 'm pretty sure the glass is clean enough to hold the head .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : hazy , luminous , pale golden color with over one finger of white foam head that is initially lofty and goes on to show some staying power . heavy lacing remains on the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : cloudy , weak lacing	000000
0	a : thin dull gold , with little carbonation rising . small white head .	000000000000000

1	appearance : pours a stunningly beautiful golden orange with thick , pale white , one-thumb ( it 's a tapered glass and i have big fingers ) head with surprisingly ample lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : looks like a pissy yellow beer , the decent head quickly disappears with no lacing . carbonation is apparent in the tasting but not the glass	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : crystal-clear , bright bubbly gold with two fingers of solid white foam sitting on top . good head retention ; lively carbonation .	0000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a clear , well-carbonated medium amber body with two fingers of lusciously creamy off-white head . excellent , rocky retention and plenty of lace . i ca n't imagine a better looking apa . seriously .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : certainly very amber in appearance . reminded me of bigfoot , but not quite as thick in appearance . has some beautiful ruby red hues when held up to light . but generally light brown/copperish . mild , tan head retention that leaves a soapy lacing on the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : light orange-brown . unappetizing rusty color . lots of bubbles on the side of the glass . thick head at first , but it melts down quickly into a thin membrane . hardly any lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : in this glass the color is awesome . it 's light honey at the bottom and gradually grows into a dark amber underneath a 1 finger head . the carbonation is very good . the head thins out in a few minutes and the beer leaves great lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : medium/dark brown , not much of a head that recedes quickly	0000000000000
0	a : pours a half finger head of no cream , bad thickness , and terrible retention . colour is a clear yellow-gold . sm : malt , straw , and stale cream . a mild strength aroma .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : golden color with a quickly dissipating head . yeast is visible throughout the glass .	00000000000000000
1	a : absolutely perfect pale lemon-yellow , cloudy but still visible carbonation , nice thin head , good lacing .	00000000000000000000
0	a : deep golden , copper with pretty much no head . no retention and no lace , obviously . just about the only complaint for me on this one .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark opaque beer with small frothy tan head that last for a short period of time out of a tapered 16oz glass .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : deeply hazed orangish brown color . two fingers of foamy head . retention is just short of average and little lacing is left . overall , an ugly looking brew . 3.5	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear , coppery medium amber with two fingers of off-white foam ; great retention and lacing . a beautiful ipa in every way .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : not the prettiest looking beer . murky straw in color with a finger or so of white head .	000000000000000000000
0	a : clear amber color . no head or lacing .	00000000000
1	appearance : deep , dark black-brown body . light brown , whipped-creamy head with lots of staying power and lace all over the place . small cloud islands in a sea of darkness ... does n't get any more inviting .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a gritty , earthy , dirt brown with a tiny tan head that fizzles to a slight rim that causes some light lacing . overly , not the most appealing looking beer , somewhat dull .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a perfectly clear polished mahogany hue with a medium corona of froth that fades to an eggshell white ring .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear , very pale gold , under the tiniest of white heads that does n't cover the entire beer . no lace , no retention . slightest bit of yeast sediment is left in this one , but seems to be filtered for the most part .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : heavy amber with a thick haze head : nice frosty dark tan head	000000000000000

1	a : the best feature of this beer . dark brown with a stunning white foamy head that lasts and has amazing retention as it settles down .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a clear mocha color but sits opaque in the glass . a finger of light tan head forms and sticks around for a shockingly long duration for an indian wells beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : meh . little head , no lacing , no tracing . a mild-dark brown with strange particulate matter ( yeast ? ) floating all around .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very little head , maybe 1/2 inch . settles quickly into nothing . beer is slightly hazy , medium yellow .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : pours dark brown with a small bubbly head . very little retention or lacing .	00000000000000000
1	appearance : great label . sometimes less is more . gorgeous mahogany reddish brown but very dark . nice creamy yellowish latte head that looks like it will go the distance . clean and filtered with lots of tiny bubbles racing to the surface . the brussels lace is textbook , bravo .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a slightly murky orange with a two inch very sticky head and nice lacing	00000000000000000
1	a : after a brief struggle with the cork , a pleasant hiss erupts and the beer rushes towards the top . pour yields a massive 3 finger fluffy white head with great retention . beer is a clear , golden orange that reveals copious amounts of carbonation . lacing is thick and frothy with great stick . an amazing looking beer all-around .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : 4.5 |	0000
1	a : dark amber with redish highlights . one and a half finger rocky , tan head . awesome retention and sticky lacing .	000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a dull , turgid , muddy sepia , opaque a short distance in from the edge of the glass though partially transparent near the rim , and even the most vigorous of pours from the ( adorable , as always ) bottle yields only about half a finger of lightly beiged head that disappears completely inside five seconds . the only remnants it ever even existed are a few streaks ( and ultimately , a few glittery dots ) of side lacing and a thin , wispy dusting of surface lace sitting near the center of the glass . yep - this one 's dead , and , to be fair , it did n't have a lot of margin for error , given the general unattractiveness of the hue to begin with .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : clear mahagony brown in color with a big 3 '' head that lingers a while . some mild lacing develops .	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours with an immense , pillowy head , nearly half the glass at first . this lite tan foam settles very slowly , leaving behind the best lacing i have seen . the lacing on the glass is thicker than the head on some beers . the beer itself is a crystal clear amber with lots of activity .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : ink black color with a small head . there is little to no retention and zero lacing .	00000000000000000000

0	a : golden yellow with a large white head .	0000000000
1	a : lightly hazy copper color with orange in there . it actually does look like the sunset .	0000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a golden orange color with an aggressive 3 '' , slightly yellow head . great retention and tons of lacing . perfect so far !	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a crystal clear light straw colored body . a 1/4 '' head formed after a very aggressive pour , and faded very quickly to just a thin ring at the edge of the glass . a few fat carbonation bubbles rise quickly here and there . only a few strings of light lacing are left on the glass just after sipping , but fade very quickly .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy yellow colored , very weak off-white head ( literally almost nothing ) . carbonation bubbles covering the glass .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a pale clear straw yellow , your usual run of the mill adjunct beer here . not much of a head , and what was left of it fades quick .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hmm , hazy medium light yellow . not exactly beautiful . medium head and carbonation . not impressed ...	000000000000000000000
0	a : 11.2 oz bottle . this beer poured an uncontrolable amount of head , almost thinking i got a bad bottle . another interesting tid-bit on the bottle was it had a made date of 05/08/2009 , best before 05/08/2014 . that seams like a long time to collect dust on the bottle and for a beer to settle .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a motor oil black , with a small thin tan head , which surprisingly stays around for a long time , though it looks kind of flat on the first pour .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : very nice amber color , closer to orange . nice two finger head , and great lacing . very active carbonation .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours beautifully . a nice thick head which leaves a delecate lace . the color is amber with golden sides . i think this is the ideal ipa color . plus it is crystal clear . very nicely done .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark sepia brown , with a full , off-white/tan head , that stays robust throughout the whole glass , leaving excellent , thick lacing . a sight to behold .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a plain black body with a frothed , though quickly diminishing , off-white head .	000000000000000000
0	a : pours a big bold black hue with very little head . there are tons of bubbles , but all it can build is a rather wimpy lilly pad esque head . retention is nil , with no lace noted .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : light copper . medium carbonation pours into a half finger , bubbly , white head . dissipates quickly leaving not much to shield your beer from the dangerous and scary outside forces . carbonation continues to rise throughout . leaves some beer ring lacing as you drink .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a 2 finger foamy white head that collapses quickly . beer is a cloudy lemon with a slight red tint ... a golden raisin if you will . no lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : cloudy yellow , with creamy white head . the best part of the beer , i think .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : super clear yellow , with only a collar of head , but decent lacing flavor : smells like a candle , tastes like one too . swear i got a waxy taste out of it .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured out of an 11.2 oz . bottle into a nonic glass . the plastic label tells me to `` serve extra cold '' and to `` drink straight from the bottle '' , but i do n't take orders from bottles . this beer pours an opaque dark brown color , but when held up to a light the beer appears a dark , ruby red color that supports the old saying that `` there 's a ruby in every glass '' . the nitro-bottle gives the head the usual cascade effect and produces a swirling storm inside the glass that eventually rises to a soft , pillowy , and very creamy looking beige colored head about one-and-a-half fingers in height . the head sticks around for an absolute eternity , and never really dissipates , just stays a thin layer of foam on top of the beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : orange-copper color , medium head . very good lacing at drinking points on the glass , and in-between with a white dotty film .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear pale straw body topped by an inch of pure white , highly active foam ; surprisingly decent retention and lace . as much as i want to attack this beer , i ca n't really say anything bad about its appearance relative to style - the color is even lighter than i might like , but the carbonation is spot on : solid without being ridiculous .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours straw yellow with a very translucent stream and fizzy head , just like the lighter sibling .	00000000000000000000
1	appearance : perfect , poofy , marshmallowy cream-white head lasts and lasts atop a barely hazy , sunset orange-cinnamon body .	000000000000000000000
1	a : looks like the stone irs - black , with a thick brown head , nice lacing and legs .	000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a wheaty-straw color ... really has a nice even character when held up to light . pretty good head with slight lacing .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : very pale golden , half inch head dissapears fast leaving little lacing	00000000000000
1	a : poured a burnt orange with a frothy 2 finger cream colored head that was moderatly lasting leveling to a skim coating that persisted for the remainder of the drink . the lacing was spongey and near full coating the glass on the way down . perhaps the most intriguing aspect visually was the insanely turbid nature , my glass was a snow globe of eye candy ( im trade-marking this so do n't even think about using it in your review ) of yeasty flakes that danced and swirled around the glass much like in a snow globe . the feverishly strong carbonation produced a topsy-turvy and rising and sinking notion of large visible bran colored yeast matter creating a blizzard in my glass . needless to say this was one of the most interesting visuals ive seen .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a hazy dark yellow , very fizzy head .	000000000000
1	appearance : quite good . pours a pale gold with outstanding carbonation and a large bubbly white head that quickly dissipates to a thin lace . very champagne like .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : amber , slightly reddish . lacing is very white with smallish bubble , dissipates pretty quickly .	0000000000000000000
0	a : pours out like champagne . big , fizzy white head . it faded quickly , but left a thin layer on top . it looks almost like lemonade . it is a clear pale yellow , with carbonation running up the glass . it is almost clear . never seen a beer this clear .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured a beautiful honey/copper hue with a 1-inch cream colored head . head retention died off after awhile , but the beer still seemed to hold a quarter inch head throughout the entire drinking session . the only true knock on the appearance was the lack of lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : gentle pour yields a .5 finger fine , milk chocolate colored head that dissipates quickly into thin wisps atop an opaque black brew . lacing is very spotty and sparse with little cling .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this was a clear , dark , golden orange color . it poured with a large , airy looking , big bubbled head that faded to moderate lace .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a monster three finger ivory head that is creamy and foamy . the body of the beer is is a medium gold color with some orange hues . there is a lot of effervescence in the beer . the clarity of the beer is mostly clear with some haziness .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : this beer pours a hazy orange color with a frothy white head that leaves decent lacing . as with other brews from mad river , this one also throws some serious sediment .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : light yellow , to basically clear , even more clear than others	00000000000000
1	appearance : big , white , belgian head , mountainous and snowy with thick , cloudy lace . body is a bright orange-amber with tiny bits of sediment in evenly-distributed suspension . bold and classy .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : amber colored , with a white head which quickly dissipates .	0000000000000
1	a : poured a one fingered rusty auburn , which is a nice rarity . this is beyond cloudy and the color that it makes is just beautiful especially with its nicely rising carbonation .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : with an aggressive pour into my snifter there was barely a head . the 1/8 of an inch of bubbly white fizz faded to nothing . the color is a hazy straw yellow . the appearance is very disappointing and is easily overshadowed by many macro brews i have had . no lacing what so ever .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pale cloudy yellow , next to no head .	00000000000
0	appearance : the pale of this yellow is extreme ; one of the lightest colored beers i have ever seen . some soapy foaming upon pouring , but no head retention . after a minute , all you see of carbonation is a few itinerant bubbles . lacing , what 's that ?	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a brilliantly hazy , orange-tinged golden body with brilliant tendrils of yeast stretching from top to bottom . up top , a big , fluffy off-white head that leaves patchy lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : black . pours with a huge , off-white , almost tan head . there 's only a little retention , but it leaves a little lace .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a 1/2 finger pure white head which quickly falls leaving minor lacing on the sides of my snifter . the body is straw gold in color .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy light gold color . just a little lazy carbonation rising to a thin , short-lived white head . has a 'watery ' look , like the golden-ness of the beer has actually been separated out and is suspended . worst of all there are ( uh oh ) flecks of brown at the bottom the glass , either spent barley husks or cardboard ; either way , they should n't be there .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : hard pour produces a beautiful deep burnt orange & blood red sunset color , with 3-finger rocky , dirty white head . lots of lacing left behind .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : reddish brown hue with a mild head - offwhite , and did n't really last long . not bad , but nothing mind-blowing .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : light porter-brown colored with ruby red tinting and white 1 '' head with seemingly both cherry pink and cappuccino tainting that stays afloat like a raft . interesting for a stout .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a remarkably clear light gold with large carbonation bubbles fueling the big 4 finger whit head in my flute . the whit head has a decent retention but not quite impressive . what impressed me was the carbonation bubbles that looked like a lava lamp in the golden body . mmm looks good .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : copper in color with a short , fizzy head .	000000000000
0	a : pours into a goblet , the exact color of apple juice . the beer itself is crystal clear , but there are chunks of a bizarre fleshy bits in the beer . i suppose that means this bottle is either the first or last of the tank , since a quick scan of other reviews indicates that this is n't the norm . i 've also seen this in dogfish head 's red and white . kinda makes me question the brewery 's qc , but moving on ... white head that quickly vanishes .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a golden straw color . big bubbly head . varied fat carbonation bubbles lazily make their way to the surface .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : poured normally into a pint glass revealed a 1 finger head and a nice ambery-dark colour that i like to see in ipa 's . might be some malt behind that hop bite .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a cloudy muddy orange head : light tan head that dissipates quickly	000000000000000
1	a : pours very dark brown , nearly black , looks `` burnt '' and features a big pillowy beige head .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : crystal clear orange with a one-finger , nonpersistent head that fizzes down to a mackerel sky and then a lace ring around the goblet edges .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : black with zero head or carbonation coming from the bottle . it could be that i got a bad bottle but in any event this was pretty terrible in terms of presentation	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : copper-amber with a exceptional head , continual lacing even after it subsides .	000000000000000
1	a : pours a deep brownish amber color with a half inch of creamy brown hued head	00000000000000000
1	a : poured a nice dark brown with tan head .	00000000000
1	a : this pint comes in an almost opaque , extre ... mely dark brownish to pitch-black hue , with an inch-thick , incredibly tight and frothy , light-ovaltine-coloured beer head which lasts throughout the drink ... decent looking .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a golden , straw-like colour . looks like a standard lager . less carbonation than i expected , however .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : the beer pours a pitch black color , with a large fluffy mocha color head which is sticking all over the glass , may be one of the best looking beers i have seen ...	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours out a golden-orange body , quite clear , and with a bubbly white head that was gone in the time it took to yell at meemo the cat for clawing up the poor , defenseless carpet . that idiot .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a deep copper gold with a persistent tan head that fades to very nice lace . after last night 's pale yellow `` amber '' beer , this one is actually amber .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : golden-yellow , white head , very little retention or lace .	0000000000000
1	a : deep garnet clear body with a beautiful creamy 1 finger tan head .	000000000000000
1	a : very impressive , clear red colour , with a firm white head that lasts forever , with some nice lace .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : not a very thick head upon pouring . head is very , very white and a bit thin . color although not bad is very pale . looks like a pilsner . straw yellow .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : straw yellow with a massive white head that slowly recedes to a thick disk , leaving tons of lace and foam in my stein	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a cloudy , dark golden w/ 1.5-inch off-white , foamy head . lots and lots of lacing .	000000000000000000000
0	a : super aggressive pour gives a minimal creme white head . it quickly dissipates to a ring . the beer itself is burnt orange in color and cloudy , ca n't see through at all . almost no lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a deep ruby that 's nearly completely opaque . good strong head forms and holds nicely if not a bit rocky . nice sticky lacing throughout .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this beer looks really good . dark golden orange color with nice fluffy white head . good sticky lacing . this looks like a very nice saison .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : deep orange , totally cloudy with a crazy pinky of thick foamy head that leaves nice lacing . i guess that 'd be a 5 for malt liquor to me !	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dark dark brown , held up to the light dark amber . white head dissipates completely and leaves zero lacing .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : red and slightly hazy . one finger red/pink head that dissipated quickly .	000000000000000
1	a : served a super dark brown with red highlights under a half inch of dense nitro head that lasted forever and left great lacing .	00000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : oooh pale yellow . surprise . minimal head and scant carbonation . the head collapses to a film after 1.5 seconds . no lacing .	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a deep red clear body with two fingers of thin white bubbly head . retention is good and lacing is pleasing .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : lightly copper-hued . you expect copper hues , but you do n't expect them to be so light . another thing you do n't expect is the absolute clarity of this brew , a clarity which , the longer you study it , seems more and more suggestive of thinness rather than simple purity . other reviewers have noted their suprise at this brew 's paleness and clarity , and i got ta say : i 'm suspicious of claims to greatness in an ipa when you do n't see at least a dusting of yeast in the amber when you hold your glass to the light .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : super clear burnt orange color . the pour dropped a nice 2 finger cream head that receeded and left great lace . this is one seriouly good looking beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : looks like mango juice with a small but very creamy nitro-like head that was very persistent .	0000000000000000000
0	a : the cork rips in half when trying to remove . using a corkscrew results in the rest of the cork falling into the beer itself . poured through the strainer , it pours blacker than the inside of satan 's sphincter . the strainer catches the pieces of cork along with what looks like phlegm a smoker of 80 years would cough up . no carbonation .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured a half finger of extremely light , fizzy head that disappeared in the blink of an eye . zero retention up top and zero lace on the glass . color is orangeish amber , which is n't bad , but the lack of head is unacceptable for a wheat -- light or not .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : one of the most beautiful pumpkin beers i 've witnessed . beautiful amber in color , nice size head slowly rises and reduces as it settles in , perfect lacing and retention here , truly fantastic !	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : clear amber with a head that fades out to nothing very quickly .	000000000000000
0	a : clear medium-gold body with just half an inch of coarse white foam ( even after a fairly hard pour ) . moderate retention and only spotty lacing . not nearly as bubbly as i 'd expect from the style , but not too bad .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pee-coloured , bubbly on the glass . little bright white head .	00000000000000
1	a : pours black with an inch of foam that is a really nice shade of dark brown . retention is good . looks great .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : vigorous pour leads to a 4.5 finger quickly collapsing head that retains nicely at 3 fingers . head is white , semi-coarse , powdery , fluffy , and very foamy . also incredibly dense . brew is a crystal clear orange that reveals a ton of carbonation . lacing is second to none . frothy , thick , and ruler-like , measuring my every sip .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : looks like i just peed in the glass . and i was quite dehydrated . very yellow and a small amount of frothy carbonation .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dark brown , almost black . a small beige head forms and leaves some light lace behind .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a very dark brown , with only the faintest glimmer of color at the edges . three-finger ( large ) tan head that dissipates slowly . lacing is underwhelming however . the size of the carbonation and consistency of the head are indicative of bottle conditioning . very attractive .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : looks pretty good , nice warm dark brown with a soft tan head , with tiny flecks of lace left behind .	000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : i notice right away that the beer level is 2 '' from the cap of the bottle . a little suspicious ... here goes . golden orange color , orange highlights , ample carbonation , 2 '' light gold head . great retention and caked on , spongy lace all over the glass	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : jet black , large mocha colored head , reduced quickly . average lacing . this is the darkest porter i have seen .	0000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : slight head . pitch black . looks great .	00000000000
0	a : pours a reddish color , small head that went away quickly .	00000000000000
1	appearance : murky reddish/brown with a huge billowy tan head . amazing retention , this is one of nicest looking heads on a dipa i 've ever seen . thick lacing clings to the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : deep copper/red color and slightly hazy . a finger and a half of creamy head stuck around for a few minutes and left nice lacing . average carbonation on appearance . it looks very impressive : especially the deepness of color .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : deep brown to black color , nearly opaque . poured with about an inch of creamy tan head , which had a retention of a couple of minutes , leaving generous lacing . so far , so good .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dark tan , no head , no carbonation	0000000000
1	a : dark black , opaque , dark brown head , good legs	0000000000000
1	appearance : clear amber brew topped by a thick head of dense white foam . light carbonation , good lacing effects .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : if theres one thing that sun king has down , its look . this one has a gorgeous , shining gold body , with a creamy white head . the foam looks a bit oily at times , as it does tend to dissipate quickly ; lacing is there , but minimal . could have been the pour , too these pints are poured more for amount of liquid than head plumage . still , theres a pretty good showing . love that color , though !	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : there 's nothing pale about the color . this is dark , dark orange and is hazy . there is a 2 finger off white head that has excellent retention and lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : not much of a head when poured was my first significant note here . in fact it soon settles with a scummy looking thin broken covering that has a small sad looking beige ring halo head around the edges . the body of the beer has a golden glow , with a few streamers . looks flat , old , tired and lonely .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : i poured this both ways , vigorously , and easy . vigorously , a one finger head was produced ; a smoother pour produced virtually no head . this review is based on the rougher pour . as a result , the one finger head disappeared within the minute . the brew is a hazy light golden color , with a slight orange hue . there were quite a few particles floating around , and i 'm not sure what exactly what they were either , maybe yeast , maybe dried fruit . i was n't impressed .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : wow ... .this is a massive beer . a moderate pour resulted in a head that exploded in the glass and exceeded its capacity at over four fingers . after i recovered and resorted to a gentile pour i saw a dark murky chocolate body that when back lit had deep ruby colors . the head was massive and sticky and receded slowly to a nice rich cover over the liquid it also supported a long-legged curtain of lacing that also hung in there long into the drink ( surprisingly considering the high abv of this brew ) .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : gorgeous look to this one . dark amber body , with a two-finger cloud white head with great retention and enough lacing to make you wan na take a spoon to the sides of the glass to get your money 's worth . hazy , as the yeast is still hanging around .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : about a finger of white bubbly head dissipates rapidly into a body that is swampy and murky . it 's a very pale orangish-yellow that to me is not that appealing , though it may be appropriate for the style .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pitch black , guinness-like color with a mocha-tan , cascading , stout-like head -- around two fingers ' worth . fine , sticky bubbles leaving a nice lacing as the head slowly settles down to a finger 's worth . head thinning out dramatically as i drink , but still good lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a beautiful pink with a peach hue . pretty pink foam cap disappears quickly to a clean surface . really a pretty beer with murky clarity which lends well to the colors .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : looks a lot darker than i expected , almost an amber/honey color . about a finger of creamy , off-white head which dissipates smoothly leaving almost no lacing on the glass . little to no carbonation . perfectly average .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : appears similar to amber wildflower honey colored in the glass . huge voluminous snow white head forces me to pour by parts into my glass as the head recedes . insane amounts of lace sheets cover my glass . surprisingly it 's very leggy and viscous as well . it does n't get any better looking than this . 5/5	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : with 2 oz reserved , poured a light-golden , clear color with minimal head and rapid dissipation . pouring the remaining 2 oz resulted in a hazy appearance ( typical ) . this style should have a thick , mousse-like , persistent head ( -1.5 ) .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a deep mahoghany brown , almost maroon . little wisps of film on top ; no head . very still , color resembles brewed tea . quite a few suspended white particles ( yeast ? ) make it look murky and less attractive . bottle said nothing about pouring carefully ... did i do something wrong ?	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a monster two finger head that has really good retention . the head is frothy and bubbly with a nice off white head . the color of the beer is a medium amber color with a nice orange highlight . the clarity of the beer is hazy , with carbonation bubbles . the haziness is from the yeast .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : a thick off-white head quickly died down to nothing in the glass , not even a thin ring . virtually no lacing . beautiful mahogany color beer .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured a very hazy , orange color , with a nice two finger white head that looked very reminiscent of ground up penicillin . bubbles shot up through the glass from the bottom throughout the session .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : clear , yellow color with 1 finger of head that fades quickly to a ring with little lacing .	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : okay it 's a 4.75 ... the head could be darker . otherwise it 's perfect . the lacing is again epic . three finger head and the retention is going on five minutes .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : poured from guinness ' unique nitro bottle . watched the legendary nitro cascade effect slowly settle . dark brown to black body , big , thick creamy khaki-colored head . unmatched retention , the definition of lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a murky brown color with cherry red hues at the edges . a vigorous , but short-lived brown , red-tinted head builds and falls down just like soda would . a minimal lace ring stays behind .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : murky brown with ruby highlights ; there 's little foam and it falls quickly .	00000000000000000
0	appearance : this beer looked terrible in the glass . the beer poured a murky off colored brown . there was large chunks of yeast floating in the glass . the head was about an inch and a half high and quickly resolved to a foam . tight bubbles of carbonation broke the surface of the beer . dam near a drain pour just on appearance .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark , but clear , brown body . has a nice two fingers of off-white head in the glass ; it retains very well , and leaves thick sheets of lacing down the glass . it 's beautiful to watch as the foam collapses evenly .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours with a huge thick creamy light brown head , similar in look to a guinness but more porous . good lacing . deep but clear black in color .	00000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : clear red/amber glass with an off white short lived head that collared but didnt lace . flavor : has a u shaped profile with a touch of sweetness starting the show , an empty watery middle and a rush of hop bitter at the end . the overall impression was a bit watery and the hops gave a slight metallic note as well . given that harsh critique ; the hop and malt flavors really made up for the odd middle .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : huge 4 finger mousse-like head is off white and very long lasting . as it recedes sizable pockets form along the glass 's edge creating a rocky and uneven head . the body is a dark mix between ruby and amber . the opaque body becomes murky when held in front of light . lacing is between fair and good . s &	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : the ale went into a brooklyn brewery ( not that the actual branding on the glass really matters , but people seem to think it 's necessary to add to their reviews ... ) snifter . i poured it from the 12oz . bottle . humming ale pours full of effervescence with a thick , puffy white head . the color is a brilliant and crystal clear amber . scent : i smell just faint and snappy hopness . it 's very clean and pure and simple . the hop aroma is dominant ( but not too aggressive ) to the lightly toasted grain on the nose . texture : light bodied . nice prickly carbonation . flavor : as with the aroma of the humming , the flavor is dominated by hop . anchor focused the hop profile of this beer on the new zealand nelson sauvin hop . the bitterness that this hop brings forward is very snappy and aggressive on the tongue . the flavor it imparts is pretty grapefruity . the malt of the beer levels out the bitterness nicely .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : medium brown in color with a slight reddish hue . very minimal off white head	00000000000000000
0	appearance : standard pour yielded a small , loose , white head that completely fizzled away in seconds . body is clear and pale gold with no visible carbonation . a quick swirl reinvigorates the head , but only temporarily . this beer has zero head retention . no lacing to speak of either , but that 's not too surprising for a blonde ale .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : four fingers of eggshell white on the pour , this fantastic looking cap has a creamy/foamy texture and is very long lasting . the head deflates more quickly along the edges of the glass , causing a lumpy mountain of foam to remain in the middle . the body has light straw colored hues . a second pour produces contiguous lacing about the glass which is quite an improvement from the scrappy segments left from the first pour .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : thin yellow glass with a white collar . this was the only beer i tried here that didnt lace . flavor : again , this beer is a platform for yeast , which is really nice . the malt and hops balance well leaving a light lemon note .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : looks almost like a pilsner ; crystal clear and golden . pours with a nice bit of foam with good bead once the head falls with lacing on down the sides ( no doubt due to the carapils and red wheat mentioned on the label ) .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : poured a tight head of only around one centimeter , although the head stayed with the beer all the way to the end . good lacing . the beer is a murky light mahogany , and at cooler temperatures carbonation clings to the side of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : black , nothing but darkness with a light tan head .	0000000000000

0	a : pours a half finger head of no cream , bad thickness , and terrible retention . the colour is a bit more appealing : semitransparent vibrant copper with some floating yeast particles . it looks alright , but i would n't call it inviting . sm : bright fruit esters , biscuity yeast , well handled malt , and fresh barley . quite a nice aroma . moderate in strength .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : a little darker than ommegang 's witte ... hazy , saturated golden hue ... practically no head .	00000000000000000000
0	a : does n't look like much . pale straw color , zero head , zero lacing , no sign of bubbles throughout the beer . honestly , it looks like urine .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours an opaque black in the center with a light ruby translucence at the edges . mocha head dies quickly into a small ring of bubbles that leave no lace or curtains .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours clear pale gold with big , meringue-like head that shows great retention and leaves wonderful brussels lacing . effervescence competes with champaign .	00000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : poured a crystal clear , golden-orange that seemed very bright in the glass . dense off-white head rose up huge and took a long time to settle down , becoming fluffy as it did so . the density and staying power of the foam was amazing . tons of sticky lace was left on the glass . flawless appearance .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a one finger head of slight cream , fair thickness , and abysmal retention . colour is a solid hazy orange/pale gold . sm : a delightfully yeasty and biscuity aroma . a bit cidery as well . lots of bretts for sure . i would n't call it funky . a strong aroma .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this brew pours with a marvelous eggshell colored head . lacings are plentiful and head retention is long . color is a medium amber . i would be proud to brew this myself . excellent first impression .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : dark-amber . little head .	0000000
0	appearance : pours a smooth extremely dark amber brew that is not quite opaque , typically i like the look of a brew that is completely black with no light showing , but this one looks good . a inch dark almond head built but quickly faded to a thin ring around the glass , the carbonation streams feed the foam ring throughout the drink . as most stouts are to me this one has a definite appeal and fits the category well . there is however no lacing on the glass at all as it slides off with the smooth thin syrup brew .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : yellow water with foamy head	0000000
1	appearance : looks like a porter or a stout , stark black with a generous and foamy white head . as it slowly faded away , the head did change color a little bit and take on a more off-white hue . the head retention was a thing of beauty and there is some lacing forming on the top of the glass already where the head dropped from . update : as the beer goes down , the lacing does not . it is really clinging to the glass all the way around and from top to bottom . this is an exceptional looking beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : standard pour yields a billowy 1.5 finger light pink head with very good retention . beer is a clear , dark red that reveals ample carbonation . lacing is patchy with good stick .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : extremely clear , practically white with a drop of yellow in it . this is the clearest and whitest beer ive ever seen . had a creamy small bubbled head that dropped to the thinnest of collars quickly . flavor : tastes like soda and a malternative mixed together . fruity , sweet , and not at all like beer . more like a diet soda	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : very dark body , with slight reddish hue . exceptional carbonation , more force behind the cork than champagne , leads to a vary lively pour . head cascades upward into a tan , creamy , dense froth - reminds me of bread dough just after the rise .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a light copper amber color and hazy . this beer does n't seem to be filtered as it is hazy , but there is no sediment and looks very clean . the head is about two fingers high after being poured fairly aggressive and it is white and creamy . lots of creamy lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the beer pours a clear golden orange color with a large , fluffy , white head and lots of sticky lacing .	000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : brownish-black color . thick lacing that hangs around for a good while .	000000000000000
0	appearance : thick , blackish coffee brown with an impossibly pathetic toasted marshmallow tan head . impressively sloshy and sticky in the glass , but the head ( or lack thereof ) unfortunately keeps me from rating this above average .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear , dark amber color with over one finger of cinnamon-tinted foam head that collapses to a large island . heavy lacing -- nearly continuous sheeting -- remains on the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pour not as thick as expected . produces a 1+ finger , medium looking mocha colored head with pretty good retention . noisy head too . black body with higher levels of carbonation for the style . head slowly fades to a wisp with lots of carbonation decorating the top of the brew . lots ! a swirling wisp and a ring remain , leaving some dots of lacing down the glass . too much carbonation for the style .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a very pale yellow with a huge amount of beaten eggwhite head . about 4 fingers worth and pure white .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : pitch black with a tan head , dissapates quickly ...	000000000000
0	a : bad . a person with poor vision would mistake this for water .	000000000000000
0	a : black with a slight ruby hue . only a hint of tan head , which quickly dissipates . no lace what-so-ever . it 's a shame the appearance brings this down ... maybe it was getting old ?	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : straw like yellow w/ a white head the fades oh so quickly	00000000000000
1	a : pours a very dark chocolate color . almost no light came through . i poured to the suggested 25 cl mark and had a large creamy three fingers of head . there was a generous amount of lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the appearance is the best thing about this beer . it appears opaque , but upon holding it up to a light one can make out a faint , light , ruby-colored hue on the edges . the center is still dark , however .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : i knew there was a problem when the cork released without a sound ... pours out without producing any carbonation ; rich caramel color	00000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : slightly hazy golden straw color . small white head forms with moderate-low retention . small stream of bubbles from the glass is indicating a higher level of carbonation . overall a very good looking beer . although there is haze , it may be more of a sign of mishandling by the distributor and/or liquor store .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a crystal clear dark gold showing very vigorous carbonation . head is not particularly large , but it forms an egg-white like cap that clings to the glass . lacing is beautiful . one of the prettiest tripels i 've seen .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours out a clear , light mahogany color with a light beige head . no doubt , its one of the prettiest hues of the beer rainbow .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured a thick , orange-tea like color , with a very small head and minimal carbonation . the brown tea color is n't very attractive , really .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : very dark brown . appears black but when held up to the light you can see through the outer edges . decent size beige head which dissipated slowly to a surface film . nothing to change here for the style .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured from a bottle to a pint glass . had a golden yellow color and a completely clear texture . there was a small amount of foamy head that quickly dissipated . no lacing at all .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours a cool looking orange red color with a good-sized sturdy beige head . it takes forever to dissipate and leaves thick curtains of lace all the way down the glass . picture perfect .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : beautiful dark evil looking amber , with a brownish head and great lacing .	0000000000000000

0	a : pale gold in color and an aggressive pour results in an inch of head with decent lacing .	00000000000000000000

0	a : dull orange/copper with no head and no lacing . is this apple juice ? because it sure as hell looks like it .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : this beer pours a deep dark opaque brown , almost black . no head to speak of and the littlest of spotty lacing on the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours into an imperial pint glass - big bold mahogany body with a huge ( but well maintained ) head and terrific retention ... extremely nice looking beer to say the least	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : super deep red color with minimal tannish head .	00000000000

0	a : comes in a pint glass with no head , so i 'm looking at alfrantzell 's glass instead . it has a finger of off-white foam with seemingly decent retention . no lace .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : the bottle is cracked open without making any bit of hissing sounda leaked bottle perhaps ? ? very dark brown in colour , with russet glows , coming w/o any signs of a beer head and a rather static body .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : clear golden body with three fingers of foamy white head . great head retention and stellar lacing . fantastic .	0000000000000000000000
0	appearance : hazy gold with absolutely no head .	000000000
0	a : cork comes out with the slightest pop . vigorous pour yields a single layer of coarse bubbles atop a nearly opaque , dark brown brew , that dissipates very quickly . lacing is non-existant .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : deep , red-auburn body with nice clarity . surprisingly , no visible carbonation within the body . a creamy , sticky , khaki-colored cap sat on top for the entire session and left tons of lacing on the walls of the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : i had to suck that head as if my life depended on it . pour went fine til halfway in when i pour straight down and the head was coming with a vengance ! frothy , fluffy cocoa head . black as night .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : wonderfully translucent brew , with a color within the copper/reddish range , a nice contrast to the pearly white compact head .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a deep red/mahogany color , almost brown , 2 finger tan head settles after 5 minutes into a full cap , sticky small bubble lacing everywhere , and it refuses to let go of the glass . very , very impressive so far .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : deep brown color clear wen held up to the light . billowy off-white head that dissipated rapidly and and lace only in spots ; that was the only thing that disappointed me about this beer ,	00000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : great presentation in the wrapped bottle , corked and caged . brown but pure deep clear red on the edges when held to light . head was 2 fingers with ok retention .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : mine lacked the satisfying blackness of most stouts . it 's a dark and translucent reddish-brown , almost like an irish red ale . other reviewers seem to have generally found theirs darker than mine , so i 'm willing to give the brewers the benefit of the doubt . there 's a centimeter-thick tan head that retains throughout . it leaves bits of lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a deep , murky , dirty gold . not much different than a blended arnold palmer . head is small and after a very short time it has completely disappeared . this one is not off to a good start .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : below par overall , but it is your typical lager .	0000000000000
0	a : not to be cliche but piss color . no lacing and a microscopic amount of head .	0000000000000000000
1	appearance : everything one would expect in an english pale ale . clear dark amber that is a nice and bright orange-copper when held up to the light . very persistent light tan 1/4 '' dense head the whole way down until the very bottom of the glass . strands of lacing that slowly slid back down into the main foam . great looking beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours extremely black , blacker than night . very little head , maybe an 8th of an inch or so during a heavy handed pour . what little lacing produced was almost sheet like with cohesion . nice !	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : thick and black . big ol & # 8217 ; dark mocha head . killer lacing .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : does n't pour much like a ris - the color is right but the head formation does n't create the bubbles deep into the liquid that settle down into a frothy cap ; this one just creates a tan head atop the liquid that quickly fades to a ringlet	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : vigorous pour resulting in virtually no head and little lacing . for imperial stout just did n't impress me .	0000000000000000000000

1	a : latte colored head with medium sized bubbles which have shrunk smaller over time . head seems to be maintaining quite well , extremely well actually ... .very impressed . body is a clean very dark brown .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : transparent brown and nice looking ruby red	000000000
0	a : pours a slightly hazy orange with a finger of beige head that recedes into a thin ring with no lacing .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark brown in color with hints of cherry and a golden sheen towards the edges of the glass . an ample , half inch of creamy off-white head sits atop that dissipates to a thin layer of cream . carbonation looks ample with sparkling water qualities .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : sudsy head , whatever 's left of which by the time you get back to your table is thoroughly unrewarding .	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : it 's a bit of a gusher though that makes for a great looking pour , with a massive head that sticks atop the orange/amber liquid ; foams clumps to the side of the pint glass	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : light , fairly clear amber/orange body with a somewhat persistent one finger off-white head . not much lacing .	000000000000000000000
1	a : pours black , with a thick , creamy off-white head , with great retention , leaves medium lacing as the beer is drunk .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : just like the bell 's expedition stout i had earlier tonight there is no carbonation at all in this one . i know the style can have low carbonation , but there was n't even a ring around the rim . otherwise , it looks good . a nice pitch black oily looking beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a deep hazy amber with a thick foamy head which quickly fades with almost no lace . seems more carbonated than usual for a woodstock brew .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : this pours more like a soda . the head is none existent , it fizzes at the top . it is super clear with a tint of yellow . it almost looks neon .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : this is a bottle conditioned brew that has a heavy layer of sediment . keep this in mind when serving . head is minimal to non-existent . carbonation threads are not observed . color is a nice deep honey . clarity is high ( if sediment is left in bottle ) . not overly impressive .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : commercialy blond lager , no head ,	000000000
0	appearance : very dark brown / borderline black - oily looking without much of a head at all - might actually be oil , not beer ...	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : beer pours a murky brown body , with a two finger off white head that sinks slowly . the carbonation levels are slow . lacing is left in large swaths .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : well , i thought maybe the date was a mistake , but it pours with the gross chill haziness of an aged beer . looks like pondwater .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : amber in color with a 1/4 '' head that breaks apart immediately . no lacing develops .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : very dark black with a pissy sudsy head . the head ran away quickly , but left a small suds layer throughout the glass .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : the beer pours a darker golden , very clear , large white head an no lacing ...	0000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear maroon body with very small tan head , no retention . at best there is a very light collar on the beer .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a beautiful mahogany hue with brillant tones of red showing thru . there was almost head head upon the pour and the beer just lays there giving off a somewhat flat appearence .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a light , nutty brown color . disappointingly , this beer has almost no head or lacing to speak of . something seems wrong here ; an oktoberfest with no head ?	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a dark brown , near black body with a small , fine tan head .	000000000000000000
1	a : i 'm completely smitten with the look of this one : burnished copper/auburn with a multitude of carbonation ribbons . mostly clear , but something mildly hazed belies the latent strength . terrific head : a healthy 2-fingers of dense foam , gold-tinged tan cream that holds a couple minutes before a gradual fall to a patchy film and sticky lace .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the beer pours a dark amber color with some brownish notes and a thin layer of off-white head .	000000000000000000000
0	a : presents as a clear golden body ( with some champagne fizz going wild within ) . the pure white 0.5cm head sits proudly atop ; which is nice , but i ca n't help but wonder why this brew is filtered and not bottle conditioned like every other abbey beer ? scale of economics perhaps ?	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : gentle pour yields a .5 finger foamy white head with little retention that dissipates into a thin film atop a cloudy , lemon yellow beer . lacing is stringy and spotty with little stick . average and the cloudiness is forgiven due to the style .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pitch black in color with a nice 1 1/2 '' brown head on it . small bubbles of carbonation can be seen rising up through the glass if you look closely . just a thing of buety to look at	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : lots of carbonation bubbles sticking to the glass and good levels of carbonation . body has a very clear yellow character . white head sinks very quickly .	000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a one finger head of fair cream and thickness , and okay retention . nontransparent dark copper colour . sm : bacteria , souring hops , and some funk . a moderate strength aroma .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark golden brown . poured with a good two fingers of foam , which dissipated quickly .	0000000000000000000
1	a : delivered in a snifter with a finger of light beige head , with the creaminess characteristic of nitro taps . retention is quite strong , and it leaves some nice lacing down the glass as i sip . the body is actually a dark , semiclear brown with reddish tint , the clarity becoming more apparent as the beer vanishes in the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pith black with a tan , brown head that dissapears quickly . poor lacing and little visible co2	00000000000000000000
1	a : pours a beautiful dark amber mahogany color with a 3 finger white head . lots of carbonation bubbles sticking to the side of the glass . great head retention and lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a copper , almost rusty amber color into a nonic pint with the pretty cascade of bubbles and nice hockey puck of creamy , khaki colored head . this is a pruddy beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : slightly hazy , medium amber color with less than one finger of diminishing eggshell foam head . no lacing remains on the glass .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a two finger , thin head of poor retention . hazy dark yellow colour . sm : light . clean . barley . nothing extraordinary . a bit disappointing .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : reddish chestnut colour , small white head that disappears completely after a few seconds . little to no carbonation .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : very thin . very light golden orange , kind of resembles apples juice . small one finger head is pretty thick but fades quickly , decent lacing . the thinness/clarity is a little bit off-putting somehow .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : cloudy , cola brown color . thick , fluffy light tan head . moderate lacing .	000000000000000000

0	a : still maroon liquid . no carbonation at all . pretty boring , but i was expecting it .	00000000000000000000
1	appearance : bright golden-yellow in color , one inch head , cloudy , high carbonation	000000000000000
1	a : the top of this beer makes a huge pop as i flip it . this is a relief , the last th beer i cracked open gave me nary a whimper . in my glass , this beer sits handsomely , almost black , with a finger-thick dark brown head that slowly recedes to a disk . solid	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a very cloudy orange/amber beer with a thin creamy white lace . there 's a hell of a lot of sediment in the bottle -- way too much in my opinion .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours deep brown with rues of red . a very small tan and airy `` nothing-head '' . no lace .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear , coppery-orange with a finger of off-white head that recedes into a thin ring with no lacing .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : hazy golden orange colored ... good 1 fingers worth of creamy white head after a nice pour ... settles to a nice layer , with fantastic lacing.. wonderful looking beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a hazy dark-iced-tea-golden color with a thick oily head that slowly faded into a bubbly film that left great rings of lacing down the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a clear golden body with lots of bubbling activity ; huge , fluffy head that created an alpine panorama as it settled down ; tons of lacing left behind	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured without even a hint of head or lacing which is disappointed , the beer itself is a weak coffee like brown that does boast carbonation in the body .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a dingy yellow color which has a head that dissipates almost instantly . considering its a wheat it threw me off guard on how weak it appeared , no cloud at all .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pale gold with a 1-finger head which quickly disappears , leaving just the faintest ring . no lace whatsoever .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a magnificent chestnut brown with moderate light penetration . despite a vigorous pour , the only bubbles churned up are from agitation ; retention is nonexistent , no donut , no lacing . meh .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy hazy burnt orange color . very little head receded quickly	0000000000000

0	a : white head , gold yellow body .	000000000
1	appearance : pours a very clear , pale yellow , urine color with a 2.5 '' tall white head . carbonation flows to the surface steadily . it shows great retention , and lots of foamy , gobby lace . perfect .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : certainly looks the part with a cloudy ( bottle-conditioned ) tea coloured body and a dense packed off-white head that diminishes to a light foam covering .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : it came in a neat-looking bottle with a blue label . there 's a picture on the label . at first i thought it was benjamin franklin in the picture , but then i figured out that it 's a picture of ... sam adams . duh . i poured the beer into a clear glass and saw that it pours an interesting goldenrod color .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a dark yellow with a large white head that recedes too quickly . decent lacing though .	00000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a two finger medium fluffy white head . colour is a dark burnt orange or tawny with higher levels of carbonation . head has good retention and settles very unevenly to a thick cap . that thick cap remains the whole way and leaves lots of nice looking lacing down the glass . beautiful look and colour . this is as good as it gets here .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : hazy deep copper . perfect marsmellow head . this is probably the best head i have ever seen on a beer thus far . also , it stays thick and creamy the whole time i 'm drinking it . tons of bubbles racing around inside .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured this into a pint glass from a 12 oz . bottle . it poured beautifully a nice off white thick head that lasted for several minutes before settling to a white film that just sat there . the color was a deep tan almost light brown and very cloudy . at the beginning this beer looked fabulously but once the head settled it became rather run of the mill .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a deep choclatey almost ashen with a full , frothy head . not much lacing . the beer seems viscous , frothy and chewy .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : it was poured into none other than my bell 's brewery american pint glass . this bell 's poured a disappointing clear and bubbly straw colored beer with a 1/2 inch head of white foam . after about a few seconds , the head of foam dissipated into a small whie film , a few white foamy rings , and streaks of white lace . it just had your run of the mill typical lager appearance .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a very pale yellow colour , with a nice fizzy , white head a first , but quickly dissipates to nothing . looks like an other boring macro lager beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark brown in color . a small head recedes to nothing very quickly and it looks kind of flat .	0000000000000000000000

1	a : light amber color , legs when the glass is swirled . it almost looks like a dessert wine .	000000000000000000000
1	a : the pour is amber in color with a whit head .	0000000000000
0	a : pours a nearly headless clear amber body . the initial head is just a thick film , and fades very quickly to nothing . a few medium sized carbonation bubbles rise slowly . no lacing is left on the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this beer pours light copper color with a one finger of white head . head recedes rapidly without much lacing .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : beautiful bronze color out of the bottle with a rich tan head that does n't go away completely , and leaves extensive lacing .	00000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pale , light yellow-hued body with goody clarity and a scant head film , though it leaves a surprising amount of lace on the way down .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : deep reddish brown hue . excellent clarity .	0000000000
1	a : golden-orange body ... slightly hazy but with a lot of shimmering highlights ; huge rocky whipped head - 3 fingers thick on the initial pour . sticky lacing leaves littles patterns like clouds along the insides of the glass	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : darker than used engine oil . completely opaque . i put a flashlight up to it and still barely saw any light through it . awesome . poured with a very slight head on it , but not a lot of carbonation visible .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : deep amber with 2 fingers gorgeous , gorgeous head .	000000000000
0	appearance : poured pale yellow with lots of bubbles , but minimal head and no lace . completely failed to impress me - vernors has more of a head on it .	00000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : pours an attractive , dark brownish-red . has a clean color to it , with a few bubbles rising up inside . has a one finger , light khaki head which sinks pretty fast and does n't leave much lacing behind .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : poured a dark ruby color with an inch of fluffy caramel-colored head . it had long-lasting retention and left huge gobs of foam down the sides of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : slightly hazy , very light amber color . absolutely no head formation or retention . how is this even possible for a wheat beer ?	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear , dark yellow/ light golden color . it initially had a small white head , but it disappeared quickly and left no lacing throughout drinking . it appears to be considerably carbonated .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : hazy blond with a finger and a half of foam that sticks to the sides of the glass nicely . retention is solid . all-around a spot-on looking wit .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very very surprizingly dark for a hefeweizen ... especially `` the original '' german hefe-weizen ale ... not very consistant with the style . head dissapated very very quick . no lacing , no head after 15 seconds at all .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : slight haze in color looking through bottle .	0000000000
1	a : pours a dark brown with some ruby highlights around the edges . a tan head rises to over two fingers . rings of sticky spiderweb looking lace is left all the way down the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : one finger of light brown head crowns an intensely dark red/almost black brew . the head sticks around for a minute or so , but leaves no lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a perfectly clear copper body with a two-finger off-white head with amazing retention staying around the entire drink . leaves a perfect sheet of lacing all the way down the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a deep black stout with single finger head which retires leaving half as much in a latte color . the beer retains the head throughout the life . thick , resounding lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : deep black in color , thin tan head	0000000000
0	appearance : pours a cocoa charcoal , a nice hue really , dark but not oppressively dark , though it does look considerably thinned out by age and the coffee addition . this belief is confirmed by the permanency of the head , or rather the lack it - one finger of fizzy , frothy , foamy sienna head gurgles itself in to oblivion after about ten seconds of fervent activity ... definitely an oily coffee addition here . the side and surface lacing are similarly ethereal , or perhaps nonexistent is more appropriate a word . a few stray streams of bubbles rise relatively quickly to the otherwise devoid and empty surface , again suggesting a thinned body .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured dark and thick ... typical ... and appeared to be forming some head until i stopped pouring . on the other hand , the lacing was amazing ... sticking and looking all comfortable , just like how victor looks and feels in my snuggie currently .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a nice semi-heavy golden color and , even though it 's sort of thin for a lager , it sticks to the side of the glass quite nicely . little to no head , though , which knocks down the score . the head was n't a fraction of an inch tall and disappears almost instantly .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours from the bottle with a deep orange color and a light tan head . the head is just a few mm thick . despite the thin head , the brew porduces nice lacing . in addition , there is a steady stream of carbonation .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a one finger head of soft cream , decent thickness , and poor retention . solid brown-black colour . nontransparent . sm : esters of fruit , caramel , caramelized malt , cream , chocolate , raspberry , and toffee . no alcohol comes through . a mild strength aroma .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : slightly hazy copper in color with a good two fingers of off-white head , leaving an appreciable amount of lacing .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : black with thick head that dissipates quickly	000000000
1	a : pours a dark brown with excellent clarity . two fingers of latte fall to a very thick quilt of the same . stubborn lacing . good looker .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark brown at first , but no light passes through as more hits the glass . thin head dissipates quickly , leaving a very small lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : sounded like a gun shot upon opening and started to gush a little . never a good sign for a big stout . poured out a murky dirty-looking dark brown and produced a massive four finger thinner-looking bubbly popping mocha colored head that was pot-holed like swiss cheese . dark murky brown or black in the glass with a little bit of carbonation evident in the form of tiny bubbles . head slowly fades leaving some chunky lacing on the sides . a thick foamy cap stays until the end and leaves some bubbly chunky lacing down the glass . looks like an abomination of an imperial stout .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a 2 finger , light brown colored cap quickly fades away leaving large sudsy bubbles on the surface . the body is medium amber brown in color and hazy .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : amazingly clear , light yellow ; very good carbonation ; three-finger head ; decent lacing	00000000000000000
1	appearance : an aggressive pour yields an equally aggressive , foamy , 2.5 '' head that fills my entire 30oz snifter to the brim . the head is eggshell , the beer is a hazy , unfiltered , golden orange color . i can barely make out any carbonation , but it is in a flurry . great retention and as the head recedes it creates pillowy peaks and valleys . a faomy coat of lace remains .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : moderate effervescent carbonation , consistent with moderate foam from clean pour . opacity lightly cloudy with solid amber-orange color .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a black body with a surprisingly high mocha-colored head ( for such a small pour ) . retention is pretty good , and the head does not vanish while i 'm sipping . leaves clumps of foam on the sides of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : srm is golden yellow with a slightly red tinge . lots of sediment floating around . translucent . heavy carbonation . light lacing .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : straw colored with moderate lacing and good retention . the thing that kills me is that the beer is cloudy , never a good thing in the world of pilsners .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : cola brown with a bit of red thrown in for good measure , it sported a nice frothy ring .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : absolutely beautiful opaque golden-orange body with a nice looking off-white head with good retention and lacing .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : i think i might have gotten a bum bottle here . i poured this very aggressively , but it yielded almost no head and lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a beautiful clear ruby red with a long lasting head which leaves an attractive lacing on the glass .	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : nice can . red , white , and blue -- hey , these colors do n't run ! the beer , poured into a 16-oz . glass mug , is neither red , white , nor blue . it 's yellow .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the colour was a rich golden brown , with head that dissipated suspiciously quickly , leaving no lace at all . i last drank leffe blonde a few years ago and i recall it being fizzy and lacy .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark , but very clear red . white fluffy head , small bubbles , great retention and lacing .	000000000000000000000
1	a : clear copper with a small cream head with lacing .	000000000000
0	appearance : i had this beer at the source , on tap at the pub in eugene . looked red , cloudy , unfiltered , ring of foam .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pitch black with a creamy mocha 1-finger head . solid retention and fantastic lacing .	00000000000000000
1	a : pours like motor oil ; thick and black . creamy , brown head is short ( less than 1/2 a finger ) but resilient . beautiful reddish tinge around the edge of the glass where light can actually pass through .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : three finger head of nice cream and decent thickness . very hazy caramel-brown colour . sm : wheat , cream , hops . moderate strength scent . kind of disturbs the nose , almost to point of sneezing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : translucent and yellow . thin , foamy head that dissipates quickly .	00000000000000
1	appearance : pours a hazy lemony yellow color with a bubbly white head that leaves some strands of lacing behind	00000000000000000000
1	a : after a tip from a friend who tried this beer , i poured as slowly as possible into my duvel tulip . after this careful procedure , i ended up with 2/3 creamy , tan head and 1/3 glowing orange body . head hangs around forever and finally starts to recede but leaves a trail of rocky lace .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : yellow with white head that dissipated quickly . lots of bubbles indicate the presence of a lot of carbonation .	0000000000000000000000
0	appearance : clear slightly tanned color . looks like a budweiser . no head	00000000000000
0	a : pours a pretty nice and solid brown color . when the light hits it , it really bursts with some nice ruby highlights just pouring forth . the head was minimal and white . sadly , no real head retention at all . i mean nothing . this puppy is just beer now . very lazy carbonation moving around in there . pretty average when it comes to brown ales .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a half finger head of fair cream , decent thickness , and okay retention . colour is a transparent textbook copper . sm : lightly toasted malt . a mild strength aroma .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : an aggressive pour provided a quarter-inch of head that quickly settled down to about an eighth of an inch on top of a clean , transparent and deep copper colored ipa .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very hazy orangish color with a small head that dissipated quickly .	00000000000000
1	a : deep black copper	00000
1	appearance : perfect crystal clear copper hue , with an off white head . the head has some staying power , but eventually falls to a ring that laces all the way down .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a murky , bright , burnt orange with a small but frothy head . the head clings to the glass nicely all the way down the glass . overall , a traet for the eyes	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a monstrous marshmellow head quickly evolves upon the pour standing a proud and firm 3 fingers high in my standard pint glass . sturdy , it slowly lapses , first around the edges invoking a `` devils tower '' structure standing in the middle . the coloring was a orange-cream with a medium sense of haze , while an initial vibrant carbonation of feverish macro-bubbles race upwards in a fairly dense state . soon thereafter things quite down carbonation wise to a slow putter of random bubbles with no where to go in a hurry , much like an old women on a sunday drive . the lacing was spongey , of broken concentric circles running down the glass providing good coverage . substantial pours produced a dense head that looked like whipped cream . overall i really enjoyed the appearance , that of an honest grain base minus specialty influences , the haze , and the long lasting dense creamy head that gave me plenty of time to both write/review and still appreciate the visual aspect long after i was done .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : poured vigorously from 50cl can into goblet . piddly little head dissipates quickly , with a touch of lacing . very clear apple-juice color , which the can describes as golden ( dore ) .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : transparent , pleasant orange-copper in color . head retention and lacing are excellent .	0000000000000000

1	appearance : bright copper orange with excellent carbonation streaming . head is a thick khaki surf foam with outstanding , chunky lacing . a flawless looking beer . just gorgeous .	0000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a golden orange , a shade darker than the similar midas touch , with a small cap of white foam which dissipates rather quickly , actually looks a lot like a mead when it comes down to it .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a medium amber with a small white head , average retention , no lacing .	000000000000000000
1	a : poured a dark as night black with a thin tan head that with a little bit of lacing sticking to the glass .	0000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : sticky lacing , thin head retention . too much head and too light in colour ( pale amber ) for an english bitter . inappropriate , even if it were to be considered a macro lager .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : had this on tap at mackenzie river pizza in billings . poured into standard pint an amber red color , not too much head , very little lace .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : huge , huge pillowy head with an unbelievable level of carbonation . beautiful looking brew that definitely whetted the appetite .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : a pitch black liquid with a massive light brown head , which leaves some lacing as it slowly recedes . i guess this is pretty close to perfection .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a deep copper-brown under a fingers worth of white head . good lace , good retention .	00000000000000000000
0	a : deep dark brown with a miniscule head that fizzes up to at most half a centimeter and disappears quickly . makes me question the freshness of this beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : typical cloudy straw yellow of a heffeweiss . more bottom sediment than i would have thought gave way to some chunky floaters . not usual , i would think . head was ok , but not like the wipped cream topping i usually see from my usual weiss beers .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : looks awesome , thick and black with a think dark tan head .	000000000000000
0	appearance : thin golden body , light effervescence , with a thin iced tea head that shifts in unison with its body -- odd ...	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a deep solid looking black with a thick head of medium brown frothyness , leaves a nice amount of lacing	00000000000000000000000

0	a : the beer is a light gold color with a very thin white head that fades very quickly and leaves a thin lace on the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a 12 oz bottle poured straight down the middle of a pilsner glass yields a full four fingers of fluffy head that barely fits in the glass . the head slowly dissipates leaving sticky lacing on the side of the glass . the color is a bright yellow and completely clear .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : not pretty . deep copper-ruby colour . head was not high , but was very dense .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : this beer arrived topless ... a victim of an untrained barkeep and a pouring temperature which locked the co in solution . the body was light copper with very nice clarity but absolutely no foam or lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : amber in the finest since of the word with a perfect 1 finger head and some of the best lacing i 've seen all the way down the pint glass . this beer was crystal clear and looked perfect !	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : beautiful near black body with a nice tan head ; nice lacing	00000000000000
1	appearance : absolutely gorgeous dusty rose beer with orange highlights . the first half of this bottle went into my new belgium globe and pours remarkably clear for a bottle-conditioned belgian-style ale . creamy ivory cap with good staying power and some nice lace .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : standard pour yields a .5 finger foamy white head that dissipates quickly into a thin white ring hugging the side of the glass . beer is a slightly cloudy flourescent peach-orange . lacing is stringy and spotty with little stick . not heady enough for the style and deducted points for lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours like black oil with a decent brown head that is mostly lasting and leaving good lace on the glass .	00000000000000000000000

0	a : first off , when i popped the cap , a huge amount of carbonation smoke came out the top and it started foaming up over the top . pours a clear medium brown color with a huge 4 finger head that fades over 10 minutes and leaves thick fluffy lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : probably the coolest pour i 've ever seen . the bubbles just forged up from the bottom , settling into a nice , thick tan head . a perfect compliment to a very black looking color . lacing looked like an intricate lattice pattern of dots .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : this beer is cloudy , color is magenta and looks really thick . has a smoothie appearance it to it .	00000000000000000000000

0	a : typical american lager yellow .	0000000
1	appearance : pours to a very thick , expanding foam . be careful . the foam mass holds well , and when it finally diminishes , it leaves an intricate , robust lace on the glass . bon jambes ! body a somewhat hazy , golden honey hue . aromas : bright citrus notes interjected from beneath with a field of wildflowers late in the bloom . body : sturdy and the enough weight for this style . strongly carbonated which adds to the t	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : pours a one finger , medium-thin , white head with decent retention . orange peel or amber orange when held to the light , but more tangerine orange otherwise . perfectly clear with only a touch of carbonation . head quickly fades to a wisp and a bubbly , soapy ring . a ring and splotchy wisp remain leaving some legs of lacing down the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a beautiful hazy honey-colored gradient with a creamy two-finger off-white head and excellent lacing . it could n't look any more appealing than this .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : transparent	000
1	a : the porter is a dark black color that looks cola-like at the absolute edges of the glass . each pour generated a sizeable coffee-and-cream head , over 2 fingers worth , that threatened to spill over my glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured into a duvel tulip and is an excellent orange-red with a slight haze and a beautiful 1 '' head that retains its shape seemingly forever . a little bit of flocculated yeast made it into the bottom of the glass , alas . the sticky lacing is fantastic .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : standard pour yields a 1.5 finger fine , light tan head that recedes as quickly as i can measure it into a thin wisp floating atop the brew . beer is a unique near opaque dark purple-brown . lacing sits where the head used to be with a waterfall effect to the level of the beer . pretty beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : burnt orange in colour with a thin creamy head .	000000000000
0	a : looks black and viscous ... perfect for an imperial stout . on the other hand , the lacing and head profile was not just lacking ... but basically missing .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : deep amber , light tan head , good retention , great lacing .	000000000000000
1	a : dark rusty amber color . two inch head .	00000000000
0	a : hazy deep orange-amber body topped by a reluctant finger of very coarse tan foam . mediocre retention , very spotty lace . disappointing for a dipa .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : very standard looking , light to middle amber . very little head that dissipated quickly . quite carbonated .	000000000000000000000
1	a : slightly hazy , ruby colored in the glass . nice white head .	000000000000000
0	a : hazy gold body with just a few stray bubbles . boring .	00000000000000
1	a : pours a nice golden color with a frothy two-finger white head supported by a constant stream of bubbles . the head becomes rather rocky as it dissipates . the head stay around for the entire drink and leaves lots of lacing . does n't get get better than this .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : looks like a barely carbonated european lager . a somewhat orangey urine color .	0000000000000000
0	a : cloudy orange , with little to no head .	00000000000
0	a : pours a super hazy yellow with highlights of brown with a big frothy white head . cool little bottle from a brewery i 've never heard of before . head dissipates quickly with almost not lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : nice burnt orange color , hazy and not much head after pouring , maybe 1 finger . head dies away quickly , but overall nice first impression .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : two finger head of very slight cream , fair thickness , and bad retention . hazy murky gold colour . sm : yeasty malt scent with bland hops .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : wondering if i poured too soft ... . the head was almost non-existent , and from past pours i know this should n't be ... does anyone have any ideas ? i 'm wondering if i stored it at too low a temp and then let it warm up while in the bottle before pouring it ?	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : murky brown and orange , reminds me a lot of iced tea . there 's not much head to speak of but there 's a light tan ring around the top . this does n't look very appealing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured into a duvel tulip glass . very cloudy with sediment . dark orange brown color . thick head , that stayed with the beer and laced the side of the glass to the end .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very good clarity with a golden blonde color . the head is white and extremely low . no retention as there is no head to begin with .	000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a four finger head of nice cream and moderate thickness . hazy yellow colour . appealing . admittedly , i 'm a newcomer to the style . sm : fresh and lovely . wheat with treated barley . estery almost citrusy hops .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : the beer is a dark hazy amber/orange color with strangely little to no head . what was there was offwhite .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : one finger creamy light brown head . jet black . nice thick lacing .	0000000000000000
1	appearance : pours with 1 1/2 fingers of dark brown head . this settles very slowly , dropping to a thin coating of foam and leaving behind nearly complete lacing coverage . the beer itself is as black as ink ; opaque even at the edges . some sediment remains in the bottle .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a light honey body with moderate carbonation and a dense , dense , rocky 2+ finger head .	000000000000000000000
0	appearance : impressive , vibrant red with a slick of froth that contrasts with it 's pearly white color . it really does look like those alcopop nightmares ...	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear yellow , similar to apple juice . pours with a small , white head that quickly dissipates .	000000000000000000000
0	appearance : copper/brownish , 2 fingers of foam falls fast . off-white head , good beading but no lacing worth mentioning . thin white covering of foam stays above the beer until near the end .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear , pale yellow with an enormous , white head that took a while to settle .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours more like a sprite than a beer . very pale pale yellow , extremely clear . huge foamy head , not much retention .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clean , clear light copper with a fluffy white head . head is not as persistent as i hoped fro the style . medium sized carbonation bubbles move briskly to the surface .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : looks amber like , and a huge head that sticks around throughout the beer . lacing is evident .	000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a pale yellow color with about a quarter inch of head that dissapears fast leaving no lacing	00000000000000000000

0	appearance : sadly , no carbonation meant no head . beer looks strange when you pour it in a glass and no head forms . it looks naked . my named doggie claws displayed a deep amber color , almost brown with decent clarity . no lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours with a slight head that eventually dissipated , deep copper , clear color	0000000000000000
1	appearance : beer porn to look at - pours a hazy golden color with a prodigious head that lasts and lasts and leaves thick gobs of lace along the side of the glass	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : viscous pour yields a very slowly forming layer of bubbles around the brew that seems to emerge gradually from the depth . beer is a dark , cloudy mahogany . no lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours with a bubbly three-finger head , with excellent retention . left delicate lacing all the way down the glass . the beer itself is gorgeous . the outer edges appear golden and almost silvery , but it quickly accrues a red hue as your eye moves towards the center of the glass , resolving into a pale amber color . the best looking beer i 've seen yet .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : absolutely spot on for the style . deep , tawny reddish body , tan head , pretty good lacing on the glass as well . looks almost identical to a paulaner salvator .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : totally black body , head is light brown creamy with good retention . lacing is great .	0000000000000000000
0	a : pours a cloudy light orange with a minimal white head , spots of lace , i like the colour , but it looks gloopy .	000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : i 'm a little nervous to try this one ... no head whatsoever suggesting a lack of carbonation . thick dark brown ( read : murky ) color dotted with what looks like chips of white paint . maybe it 's just the batch , or maybe it 's just the sediment left over from brewing , but this beer is by far the worst-looking beer i 've had this year . ( amendment : read some other reviews and realized that it was my mistake to pour the sediment into my glass ... whoops ! lol ... i raised the score from a 1 to a 2.5 )	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : delivered to the table a clear , golden-amber body with just under an inch of white head .	00000000000000000000
1	a : deep brown , barely visible light . thick , whipped tan head . strong lacing . great .	00000000000000000000
1	appearance : two finger , foamy , tan-peach head forms on the initial pour . body is dark brown , if not black , in the center and shows shades of reddish amber around the sides . head retention is awesome - freakishly long-lasting . great notch-like lacing all the way down . what else can i say ? perfecto !	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark husky brown , with a thin tan head that dissipated quickly but had good lacing .	0000000000000000000
0	a : the usual piss-yellow that i 've come to despise .	000000000000
1	a : pours beautifully , great 1+ '' head and lacing during the drink . color is clear and great .	000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a bud light esque yellow with a small white head that disappears in about 3 seconds . not particularly attractive .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a nicely hazy , almost opaque , pale hay color . the pour produces a 4-5 finger head that fizzles down to a one finger head by the time you finish the beer . the head is extremely rich and creamy . this is the best looking beer of the style that i have had and may be one of the best looking beers i 've ever seen . there is some lacing , but not too much , i feel this does not distract from the fact this has a virtually perfect appearance for the style .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : beautiful golden brown color , nice white head , peaceful stream of carbonation . if looks were taste this beer would be off the charts !	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pale yellow and not very cloudy at all . nice lacing though .	000000000000000
0	a : the beer is a light yellow color with a very thin white head that fades almost instantly and leaves very little lace on the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this is what a good , drinkable stout should look like . it poured nicely , forming a slightly brown cap of foam that stuck around for a few minutes before fading into some very lovely lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pale yellow , almost no head of foam ;	00000000000

1	a : pours a deep mahogany brown color with one finger of frothy off white head . leaves a small amount of lacing	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : clear mahognay . thick , healthy crop of rocky light beige head is erected on top . the retention and lace abilities are very good . vigorous carbonation is noted in the body of the beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : cloudy burnt orange in color with no head .	00000000000
1	appearance : this beer looks rich , completely dark with tremendous amounts of sediment . there is paper-like and fine particle sediment in the bottom and sides of the container 's inside , some of which transferred into my glass ( even with a slow pour ) . the beer has an oily halo that is of incredible richness . this fine layer left on the inside of my glass produces a rusty-yellow glow when held to the light . i have never seen anything like this beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : cork flies out of this one . huge fluffy white head over a straw body with lots of trains of bubbles	00000000000000000000000
0	a : i rated this average b/c i drank this from the bottle while camping and really could n't see it that well . i did notice a good , creamy lasting head .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : popped the cap on this one and it bubbled up and over the top of the bottle almost immediately . when poured into the glass it has the appearance of cloudy cola with a quarter inch of tan and sandy brown loosely bubbly head that fades into a cap rather quickly . maybe it was a result of the initial bubble over but i was hoping for more than this in the looks department .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : this is one fine looking beer . its black with a very big very creamy light light brown head . good lacing , good retention . i even got somewhat of a cascading effect . lovely .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this one pours a very deep brown ; its almost black . the head is superb , bubbling up like a thick , beige whipped cream . excellent retention and some really spectacular lacing give this one of the most sophisticated looks ive seen from a stout . its one of those examples of timeless beer beauty .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : crystal clear pale yellowish straw colour , thin lace that has trouble staying right after the foam subsides .	000000000000000000000
0	a : this stuff reminds me of ginger ale or n/a sparkling wine . pale golden color . huge and copious carbonation bubbles . head fizzes up and disappears almost immediately . no lace . the color hue is the only reason this stuff does n't get a 1 on appearance .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : burnt amber with a nice two finger frothy tan head disspiating into a substantial lace .	000000000000000000
1	appearance : a vigorous poor gives the beer a nice , 2 finger thick khaki colored head which settles to a quarter inch film . nice lacing so far . clean and clear and deep red ! this looks good , the red is very rich and when held up to a light , amber glares peak through .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a transparent golden color with plenty of active carbonation rising to the surface . off white head rises to 1.5 '' and is cakey . the lace is very sticky and clings to the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear golden straw color . a white head forms and leaves some light sticky lace .	00000000000000000000
0	a : it pours a very dark and murky brown color with no head and very low carbonation . it does not look appetizing .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : mild amber color with medium head .	000000000
1	a : hazy bottled-conditioned medium orange color . two fingers of incredibly creamy and dense off-white head with sickeningly wonderful retention and tons of sticky lacing . i ca n't find a reason not to give this a 5 . 3.5	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a very light straw yellow . it has a fizzy head with large bubbles , nothing spectacular .	000000000000000000000
0	appearance : body is thick and viscous , just about as opaque as they come , the blackest shade of burgundy . even though i poured as vigorously as i could , there is virtually no head , just a thin layer of creamy tan froth that disappears quickly .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a one finger froth creamy white heads that has very little retention . the color of the beer is a pale straw color . the clarity of the beer is clear to brilliant . there is a lot of carbonation .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : the appearance is a very cloudy pinkish orange with no head , this looks more like juice than beer . i understand that the addition of mangoes makes for a cloudy appearance , but this just does n't look like a fantastic beer . i have a feeling that the taste will make up for the appearance .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured into a pint glass a lemon yellow colour with a 1/2 '' bright white head after a vigourous pour . lively cabonation bubbles from the bottom as the head disintegrates . looks very crisp , not off-putting .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a pink grapefruit hazy body . creepy . 1 '' soapy white head fades fast to nothing . lots of tiny stuff floating around in it , i do n't think it 's yeast .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this class of beer does n't belong in a glass . great looking can .	00000000000000000
1	a : slightly hazy , faint lemon color with a decent fluffy white head that fades quickly to a thin film of bubbles .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : jet balck and topped with a half inch , mocha colored head that faded into nothing for some reason . i cleaned the glass too .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : bright , clear light golden color , with a few bubbles seen streaming from the glass bottom . the head starts out huge at about 5 fingers , and features a good amount of lacing and fair retention .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : i love a robust ipa in color : this one is a deep auburn-brown , about the color of the crust on a loaf of baked wheat bread . cloudy and unfiltered , the haze glows a ruby-orange when held to light ; tiny bubbles rise periodically . terrific head , a fluffy tuft of khaki building to well over a finger high . creamy lace sticks in wide webs from top to bottom .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : an insanely huge , billowing white head of foam , like ice cram , with big bubbles sucking to the glass . body is a hazy golden yellow , with tons of tiny bubbles swirling and surging toward the top of the glass . even with subsequent pours it leaves such insanity , and the lacing 's left in clumps and nice lines .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a light golden ale with some haziness . a three finger , large bubble , whipped meringue-like head hangs out nearly indefinitely . nearly total sheets of lacing . almost perfect look .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : translucent and pale yellow like a macro lager . the thin fizzy head dissipates almost immediately leaving barely any lacing .	00000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very little head retention at first pouring , soda like . clarity is fine but no head .	00000000000000000000

1	appearance : very dark and cloudy brown with a huge thick head and above average lacing .	00000000000000000
1	a : pours a hazy golden with a massive white frothy head . long sustain and tons of lace .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : disappointedly clear for the hefe as the body is not very cloudy , however it boasts ample carbonation . it produced a finger 's worth of head that sadly did n't lace or retain .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pour is a cloudy orange-yellow , erupts out of the bottle into the sink . fills the glass entirely with foam .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : this thing looks fantastic , plain and simple . not only is the nitro effect completely stunning , but the body has an imposing dark body ( not pitch-black , though ) , along with a fabulously creamy 2-finger head with some of the best retention and lacing i 've seen .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : good white head , gradually collapsing but never quite disappearing . beer itself looked a little cloudy/turbid . this particular cask did not seem to have dropped bright .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : 1 1/2 finger off white head . pours light copper . decent retention . very little lacing .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : nothing exceptional about the appearance of this beer . it was a light copper color with a white , coarse head . i got a finger of foam out of it with some coaxing , but it was gone in a flash . the small amount of bubbles that remained left no lace on the glass . it did have a pretty heavy bead , which i was surprised to see .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : slightly hazy , golden yellow with a nice white head that leaves minimal lacing .	00000000000000000
1	a : pours black with ruby highlights . has about a finger worth of tan head . settles to a nice cap and leaves quite a bit of lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : cola color , with very tiny foam and low carbonation .	0000000000000

0	a : pours a murky , maroon body with half a finger of instantly-vanishing beige head . there is light filming across the top , a collar around the drink , and lacing down the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a hazy light amber with about one finger of off-white head . the head retention is quite poor and there 's little carbonation .	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pale straw yellow , big sudsy head , impressive carbonation effect , could be the glass helping but still impressive . big patches lace sticking to the glass . honestly good looking for a light beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a pitch black color with a two-plus head which is tan in color . great retention . very impressed with the carbonation level after 2 years of cellaring .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured a deep orage with good carbonation and a nice white cap	00000000000000
0	a : light yellow . very fizzy . bit of head . standard for the style .	00000000000000000
1	a : poured with a very large , off-white , creamy , frothy head that seemed to last forever . thick , clumpy lacing left on the glass . body is a deep , ruby-red color , and extremely clear .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a watered down translucent amber body with a tan head that leaving a bit of thin lacing and not very good retention .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : deep amber to brown with loads of brown speckled sediment . i 'm seriously wondering if it 's not some rehydrated bits of crispy bacon . a finger or so of dusty head recedes to a wisp ring and leaves no lacing . not very appetizing appearance . 1.5/5	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a nice black-amber . head is about a half-finger with some white foam haze resting on the top of the liquid . lacing is splattery and fine . pretty nice looking , fits the bottle color scheme and the devil motif pretty well .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : fizzy and light brown beer with absolutely no beery yellow touches . a color i can honestly say i 've never seen in a beer . carbonation is high and generates alot of billowing , empty foam .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : seriously looks so good . pours like a yoohoo with mixed brown colorings during the pour but all mix to a super dark brew with a 2 inch rushing waterfall head . looks awesome	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : clear yellow . slight orange hue to it . the small white head drops to nothing . it has only the slightest bit of haze to it .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : gold-ish yellow , light in color . small head that faded quickly . light lacing .	000000000000000000

0	a : pale orange but it looks pretty decent overall .	00000000000
1	a : it has a common pour from this style of beer .	0000000000000

1	a : really goo-looking ruby-brown with creamy off-white head with good retention .	0000000000000
0	a : nearly black with ruby edges with cola-like 1-2 finger head that disappears pretty quickly and leaves no lacing .	000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a fizzy , thin , loose off-white head with horrible retention . very loose and fizzy head . pathetic . fizzes down to a bubbly ring and half wisp . slightly hazy tenne orange with no carbonation evident . a bubbly ring remains but leaves no real lacing down the glass . color is nice , but the head is embarrassing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : i remove the cork without so much as a hiss of carbonation . beer is completely flat as totally expected . no head and no lacing . beer is an opaque , motor oil black .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : porter/3 pistoles like dark , the ring of lace was sort of off-grey .	0000000000000000
1	a : the beer looks great ! its a light orange color , visible carbonation , perfectly clear , and a fluffy cloud-like head but with no visible lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : mild haze within the deep reddish amber colored brew , patchy big bubble lace is thin and soda like .	0000000000000000000000

1	a : pretty decent creamy head , very brown in color , about 1.5 fingers thick . it lasted for the entire beer ; i love when that happens . high expectations for lacing were met , covering the walls of my pint glass in sheets . the body was dark black ( as if that makes any sense ) and completely opaque .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours amber with a thick white head , good retention , great lace .	0000000000000000

0	a : opaque black color showing light transmission at the edges , with off-white residue of foam that tries to climb the walls of the glass . no lacing remains on the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a deep mahogany with red highlights . appears black on a superficial look . mild off-white head , fizzy , hardly any lace - spotty .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a cloudy brown . has a slightly offensive color to it ... looks a tad like diarrhea to be honest . very fluffy head with little retention and lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a beautiful golden hue . some fizz leads to a light head . okay retention and no lace .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : i 'm sure this is described as `` golden '' quite often but it looked like more of a urine yellow to me ... decent head that was quick to fade , minimal lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : basically no carbonation , slightly cloudy thin yellow .	00000000000
1	a : a light straw color with a nice white head . crystal clear .	000000000000000
0	appearance : opaque due to the black colour . the head is deep brown and low . poor head retention and no lancing whatsoever .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : super carbonated bubbles forcing their way to the surface consistently . veyr light golden color with a thick 2 inch white head that does n't fades very quickly at all . holds steady for a while . very good .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a one finger medium looking off-white head with good retention . no carbonation evident . pours clear and a nice venetian red in color . head fades to s wisp and a thick ring . splotchy lacing remains until the end leaving some splotchy lacing down the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : waaaayyy too much head . from what i did pour out of the bottle with the most gentle of angled pours , it frothed up immediately into a huge 6 '' frosty white head in the mug . retention is astounding as i let it sit in the mug for a solid five minutes with no reduction . clings and laces like a mf'er . if you 're looking for beer foam as a cooking ingredient , this is your beer . do n't even attempt to shake one of these suckers up as a joke . you 'll kill somebody . when it did settle down , it was a medium bodied amber color .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : this is a pretty darn fizzy-looking beer , light yellow - almost in champagne territory - with a rather sad head that does n't last long enough for me to even accurately describe it . but i 'm pretty sure it was white .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a dark chocolate brown color with ruby highlights but , as others have commented , no head	00000000000000000000

0	appearance : impeccably clear , with a color similar to that of apple cider . no head at all . it does n't even look like a beer , really .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : light amber colored , slightly hazy , finger and half of cream colored head . lots of carbonation off the bottom	00000000000000000000000
0	a : a light greyish yellow , with a very short lived head that fades into a white ring arround the glass .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : pours the most pathetic head i 've ever seen ; a quarter finger of bubbles sits atop the beer , and dissipates within a couple minutes . not even a true head as the bubbles do n't cover the top entirely ; there 's a patch devoid of bubbles . jet black colour . it seems something is wrong with the beer even though i poured it from a just-opened bottle . sm : coffee , roast , chocolate , caramel . light . i 'm hoping this beer tastes better than the appearance and smell are indicating ...	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : honey color , not quite clear , small head with no lace	00000000000000
1	a : poured into a pilsner glass , this is a spectacular looking beer . crowned with a moussy , gleaming white head that slowly drops down to a quarter inch or so . light gold hue . cloudy . visible effervescence .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy and gold in color . it has a substantial amount of head and noticeable amount of sediment .	000000000000000000000
0	a : pours into a goblet an almost jet black hue , with a little reddish hint against light . the head is very restrained , without the help of force-pour , forming just a thin layer of sparse big bubbles . quite static it looks .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a slightly brownish shade of ruby rude with a mixture of loose clear bubbles resting on top of the tightly packed one inch head , the head fades away into a cap in a minute or so and leaves little lacing along the way to the bottom of the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a lightly hazy lemon-yellow with a thin , short lived , fizzy white head that quickly bubbled away into a faint collar . carbonation and head characteristics remind me of soda , not of a heff . no lace .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : extraordinarily pale yellow . a decent amount of foam for about 2 seconds then it goes flat .	00000000000000000000
1	appearance : the color of ... it 's a medium gold color . ( i 'll let some other reviewer make that joke . ) a 1/4 inch head with minimal to moderate lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a translucent , muddy orange color with a very short ivory head . retention is short as well . some spotty lace remains on the sides of the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours dark mahogany brown . little mocha head falls quickly leaving a simple , oily surface . excellent clarity , actually surprisingly thin appearing with light passing through a full pour , a bit disappointing . no lacing . surprised there was no head given the description on the bottle bragging about the head quality/quantity .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : beautiful rich yellow/orange color like a popsicle , little carbonation , and little head retention .	000000000000000000

1	a : pours a deep , dark brown with an off-white head . looks like a porter should .	0000000000000000000
1	a : as usual , this beer has amazing clarity . great lagering effect . medium lacing with an offwhite head . wouldnt call it amber in color , more orange to red .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a pale , straw color with virtually no visible head . highly effervescent .	00000000000000000
1	a : flawless . beautiful dark red-brown color that is still a little transparent . lots of carbonation can be seen feeding a tan-redish head . no lacing or film left on the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : head fades almost immediately . dark with lots of brown and amber tones . pours and looks like a glass of diet dr. pepper	00000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : golden in colour with a small head but with reasonable retention which is quite solid . some totaly sexy lacing which is very respectable . there isnt much that is wrong with this beers appearance .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured from one of those giant cans into a pint glass . looks pretty bad and the head is downright awful .	000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : deep and dark with glints of toffee around the edge . two fingers of off white head slip down to a touch of sticky lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : wow , thats some head . billowy , fluffy , starting to condense on itself forming a rocky landscape , clinging to the sides like its drowning . body is a deep gold with a solid column of carbonation at the center of my fischer tulip glass . left clumps of foam on the side of my glass that look like ill need a wire brush to remove them . flavor : a mild malt taste , gentle fruit and pepper tastes , with a slightly funky finish , almost a cardboard but not unpleasant . some alcohol tastes come through as well . overall , a very subtle flavor , and somewhat like a wit minus coriander . i was expecting a more tart or sour flavor , but im not getting that .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : very , very light . would be like apple juice if it was mixed with water . honestly , if i hold the glass to the screen , i can read through it .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a very light lemongrass color . no head at all , this looks like dead hottenroth . there is some bubbles sitting around in the glass but overall this could have used some time to possibly develop some carbonation .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : ca n't say much as i drank it from the can , but i am sure i can take a wild guess and say it looked like piss with no head .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : orangey color , opaque , like the traditional unfiltered yeast was also mixed with some tropicana pure premium , or something . definitely caught me off guard . not sure i was a fan of the appearance .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : amber-orange with tons of tiny suspended particles in the glass . a good finger of head at the pour faded to a half cover then disappeared about halfway through without lacing . flavor : a good winter ale . rich malt with some molasses notes , but not sweet . spices are at a nice level , mostly allspice and spruce , both fairly mild . not nearly as heavily spiced as anchors seasonal or as rich , but kissing cousins from an extended family .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a very prodigious head of tan atop a deep brown/black body . two fingers of head that really stick it out leaving residual up the side of the glass at least a half inch and in the glass until near the end .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : hazy , very dark golden-brown . a spiraling , massive white head , and i tried to pour it lightly . it eventually receded to a few millimeters with patchy lacing high up the glass . the lacing is amazing to look at .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : deep brown with tons of yeast and protein sediment suspended in the brew . a two-finger head of creamy , beige foam holds pretty sturdy and leaves a bit of nice lacing . a bit off-putting appearance though .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a clear orange tinted lemon-yellow with that signature duvel billowing whipped egg white head that we 've all come to love . a huge oily dense pillar of foam appeared as the frothy white mound slowly receded into fuzzy lace .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the beer is transparent and light yellow in color . the head is light , white , fluffy and stands in at about a half inch tall . as it fades , it manages to leave some faint traces of lacing on the pint glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear medium-amber body with a big 3 '' head of rocky white foam . good retention and tons of fine spiderwebs of lace . lovely .	0000000000000000000000000000

1	a : clear brown body under a big slightly off white head . excellent retention and lace .	000000000000000000

0	a : pale amber that 's perfectly clear . very complex , thick head of off-white foam head .	0000000000000000000

1	a : the appearance is a thing of beauty . the head was bone white , 3 fingers easy , and so rocky it was falling over itself . and i poured the double simcoe as gently as possible . the head retention was in another time zone . picture-worthy lacing . the body was richly brown , medium saturation of color , and showcased orange and tawny tints . so hazy and , with the yeast sediment still getting situated , i 'd say it was heavily cloudy or even murky .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured with an exceptional 3 finger head of some of the thickest and richest foam my eyes have ever seen . the beer itself is a murky burnt orange ... which shows streams of carbonation rising to the top .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : opaque black with a thin ruby edge . dark tan tight head has already left thick sheets of lace that look like frost on a window . flavor : seems like a stout base , and a fairly thin one , almost a brown ale . spices are nice , present but not overwhelming . very mild malt , no real hop note .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a murky brown color , with not much head . and what was there did not retain well .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a classic ... guinness draught..that you can find just about anywhere . how i forgot how damn cool it looks in the glass . it looks as good as any beer . pours a nearly pitch black color , while the nitro-tap gives this beer a gorgeous , creamy tan head that is so dense that you ca n't distinguish a bubble at all..head retention is outstanding . i could go do my laundry , make a sandwich , and catch a few episodes of seinfeld and i still do n't think it would look any different than the second it was poured . leaves rings of lacing on the glass with every swig .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : half finger head with appealing slight cream lacing , decent thickness , and abysmal retention ( less than fifteen seconds ) . colour is a light amber , semitransparent . sm : amber hops , heavy raspberry and strawberry fruit ester hops , butterscotch , and cream . quite pleasant and unexpected for the style . moderate strength aroma .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a nice dark copper to amber body . very fizzy head builds to about a finger and then , well , fizzes away . minimal lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : two fingers of dark beige head that laces the glass nicely . dark amber in color , good amount of carbonation off the bottom .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : amber color with a small whitish head that fades rapidly ; poor head retention ( better head retention is standard for this style ) but good lacing . clear which suggests no dry hopping .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pale yellow body . tiny white head that fell to almost nothing .	000000000000000

0	appearance : a crystal clear , bright pale yellow liquid with not much of a head at all . in fact , it 's nearly still .	000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : on-tap at the new claim jumper in clackamas , or . the beer was served with a lemon ( i should 've asked for it without ) floated on top of an overfilled pint glass . very hazy wheaty yellow , absolutely no head or lacing , lackluster to say the least .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : when poured into my samuel smith imperial pint glass , the beer was a light mahogany brown color with ruby highlights . the head of foam was a big disappointment . all i got was a small skim of white foam and after only 1 minute , there was nothing there . no rings , no white sticky lace , nothing ! by the appearance it looks like it 's from january 17 .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : medium cola brown , fading head , no lace .	000000000000
0	a : pours a murky orange body with a pinky finger of off-white head . for a pale ale i expected something fluffier and longer-lasting . the cap quickly vanishes into a thin collar and leaves only the slightest dribbles of lace at the beginning , then nothing more .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : beer pours a slightly hazy very light orange with a beautiful dense foam that reminds me of the way most sierra nevada foam looks . the meringue floats atop the beer for the entire glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : black , that showed a deep amber red when backlit . clear , with a creamy light tan head that lasted a while flavor : clean taste with malt and hints of smoke . great balance with the malt being dominant , but not heavy handed . i let the beer sit for a while and the carbonation died off , but still left a bubbly and dry aftertaste .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : tons of head atop a clearish pale orange body . gorgeous lacing .	000000000000000
0	a : clear , dark amber color with a peripheral ring of off-white bubbles . no lacing remains on the glass .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy beer of dark yellow-orange color . head is only about 1 finger high and seems small for a wheat beer poured in a weizen glass . lacing is very low .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a dark mahogany color with a huge head . i can barely pour the beer . every drop is turning to foam . just wo n't seem to go away throughout the beer . this does n't look so good . leaves alot of lacing . more than some pale ales and maybe too much for this style .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours as i thought it would , not black , but more of a deep brown . there is almost no foam , absolutely no lacing , and you ca n't tell that you even drank any beer cause the glass stays clean the whole way through .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : holy jeez , batman ... it looks like beer !	000000000000
0	a : dark rasin black , very alluring , could kind of see into it if it were just a shade lighter . thin to no head , no lacing . a vigorous swirl provides a half finger tannish head , but again doesnt stick around for very long .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : well , i have to agree with joe os this one . it is indeed a deep mahogany color , but i was not impressed with either the head or that lack of carbonation or the lack of lacings . this beer , after about two minutes , looks like a flat pepsi that has been left out for a couple hours . not very impressive .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : light yellow tinted , like a faded stained glass window .	0000000000000
1	a : light amber sort of orange color . incredibly fluffy and long lasting off white two finger head . sierra nevada 's ipa 's always look so good .	000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a macroy looking golden straw color though admittidly darker than its american counterparts . head as typical macro foamy white that bubbles away into nothing in a matter of seconds . less than impressive .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : i would not call this dark , really . its orange . its lighter than most dubbels . its got a nice puffy white head . looks really good , but does n't look like a dark beer of any kind . that 's not really unibroue 's fault though .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : this brew pours with a thick foamy head . color is a medium amber . clarity is fairly high with a very slight cloudiness . chill haze ? lacings are very plentiful . head has an amazing sustain . this is certainly an exceptional appearance .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a very dark ruby with a massive persistent head . even after waiting several minutes , i still have 2/3 of a pilsner glass full of foam .	0000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : i have to say , the bud light does look refreshing . the light color with a tiny , but very bright , white head makes it look pretty appetizing . that said , what little head there is vanishes almost instantly and there is no lacing at all .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a copper color , slightly amber , with lots of fizzy carbonation . there 's not a prolonged head . in fact , after a minute or two all that 's left is a few bubbles skimming the surface .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : hazy copper with no head ; very little carbonation . plenty of sediment left stuck to the bottle .	000000000000000000000
0	appearance : well , usually this section is dedicated to describing the head and overall color of the brew . well , the only thing that i 'm going to add is that there heavy sedimentation . bottle conditing is not unknown to very small breweries . however , this brew , despite the front of the label , is actually bottled by pyramid breweries . this is a contract brewing . sedemintation is not expected from a brewery with that kind of capacity .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : wow , is this one light colored dipa . held to the light , would have thought it was some sort of belgian , strawlike . the head is sturdy sea foam and flat out great lacing . we have some floaties at the bottom of the glass . from a bottle , this is one of the most distinctive and nicest looking pours i 've seen .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the pour is black and completely opaque with a finger and a half of tan head that holds very well and leaves good lacing .	000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : looks just like a draft the way the bubbles settle down into a nice black body and a creamy tan head with lacing all over the place	00000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : very slightly reddish yellow . pours with a heavy thick head , which i should add now to watch out when opening the can , head subsides to a nice covering and continues to cling to the glass all the way down .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : yellow , slightly richer in color than bud or miller . no head but it was probably a faulty pour , as is common in chain restaurant bars . clear with slight lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : a nice copper mohagany color . starts with a decent off white head and instantly dissipates into nothing . nice and clear	000000000000000000000000
1	a : vibrant golden rod with massive amounts of bubble activity . head is slightly spritzy but overall creamy , just a touch off white . the bubble activity nevers stops actually , i 'm quite impressed . head remains as a solid pillow the entire time . edit to add that after reading other reviews , this picture perfect carbonation is not common . either i got really lucky or they made some positive changes at the brewery .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : gorgeous hazy pear with particles that hardly settle , a thin sheen of a white head that almost seems like an afterthought of the haze ( the gradient of color from the top to bottom is perfect ) , and some brown yeast floaters inside .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the color is like a beautiful honey , great carbonation .	0000000000000
1	a : the beer is a deep black color with a short dense light brown head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : this is an ugly looking brew . opaque orangish brown . one of the worst colors i 've ever seen . this had too much carbonation , so it took three pours to get the glass full . eventually , three fingers of foamy off-white head . retention is good , but lacking is sparse and completely randomly placed . 3.5	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark black , with a slight ruby tinge . some off-white , almost tan head , but no retention or lace . a stout needs a standup head !	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours an unsurprising wheat-like color , hazy and unfiltered with a small amount of sediment .	000000000000000000
1	appearance : cloudy orange haze head : fluffy cream head that dissipates quickly	0000000000000
1	appearance : pours a copper color with orange highlights . about 1.5 '' white head forms which has very nice retention and lacing .	000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : looks like a nice lager - deep golden amber , medium viscosity with heavy lacing .	000000000000000000
0	a : i had read a few reviews of this one that talked about how flat it was , so i was n't surprised when there was absolutely no pop when i took out the cork . what i was n't ready for was the way this beer looked . this is an ugly mother . the color is a muddy , murky brown that kind of looks like sewage .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very saison-esque golden/peachy with a pearly white head that did n't last too long , but i 'll blame that on the fact that it 's a little aged .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark black with tan , almost brown one-inch head . nice lacing on the edge of the glass . head gradually dies down to a thin layer left along the edge of the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : the appearance is n't that great at all . the foam hardly even lasts for a minute i think . it has pretty luch no lacing . i like the color though . and i always think it looks nice when it 's in that green bottle . ( no i 'm not being sarcastic ) . i honestly think that they would n't be able to make a crisp smooth heineken and have a creamy long lasting foam at the same time . you ca n't have everything i suppose .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : dark brown body with a fizzy , small , tan head that vanishes quickly .	00000000000000000
1	appearance : the body has a bright clear orange amber color with lots of cool visible carbonation . the head is very long lasting and maintains a small cap of foam all the way to the last sip . lacing is very good as well .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dark brown/black with clear crimson tones around the edges in the right light ; a ring of foamy head , which dissipates quickly , without much lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this bottle of beer wonderfulness pours a an extremely dark garnet with brown hues . on top of that is light foamy tan head about two fingers worth . this is one beer that i could gaze at for a while . aromas : a very light hop nose with the coffee and chocolate malts roaming all around . the vanilla beans it 's brewed with top off all those scents like a cherry on an ice cream sundae .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured a dark amber , slightly cloudy . 1 finger slightly off white head , with decent retention ; it soon levels off to a few mm thick coating . very nice lacing all the way down .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a half finger head with okay cream , bad thickness , and bad retention . colour is a cloudy yellow . sm : light champagne , unfermented sugar , and lemon . a mild strength aroma .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : a dark , nearly black , reddish brown body with laser-beam red highlights . up top , two fingers of creamy -cream-colored head that endure almost to the end of the glass , leaving excellent sheets of lacing on the way down .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the beer pours a very nice , blueish purpleish color , very cloudy and an almost pink colored head , and great lacing ...	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a murky straw color with a huge rocky head that faded to absolutely nothing and left no lace .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : gold with small head , but reasonable rising carbonation .	000000000000
1	a : poured a neaf black color , with a dark tan , frothy head .	0000000000000000
1	a : dark brown , just short of black with a huge rocky cap and great retention . impressive .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : i would n't be able to clearly identify this as beer by sight alone . as described before . it has lots of rising bubbles but no head retention , like soda .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : i may have gotten a bad bottle , this one had zero head on it . very nice amber color .	00000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a yellowish orange color with a thick white foam head that dissipates to a small film . there is some moderate lacing .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a nice caramel color with sudsy light tan head , but is marred by an unappetizing suspension of particulate distributed uniformly throughout the glass . with each sip , i think of that particulate , and the fact that i am ingesting it . off putting .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the beer is very dark brown ( close to near black ) in color and poured with a finger high creamy brownish gray head that has excellent retention properties and consistently left a quarter finger high head covering the surface .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : rather bleak looking , served with absolutely no head whatsoever , looking thin and watery in the glass . dark brown to black body without any retention or lacing . yikes . i 'm not sure whether or not to fault the brewers or the tap system at the bar for this dismal looking beer ...	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark ruby/brown color . a large beige head rises to over two fingers . the rocky foam recedes to a ring , and leaves some spotty lace behind .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy , unfiltered dirty blonde color . lots of big streaming bubbles to a thin head that dissipates too quickly in my pilsener glass .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a quite cloudy , dark orange copper hue , with a rimmed beer head which looks really just normal	0000000000000000000000
0	a : poured very hazy amber . minimal carbonation . at first i thought this beer was flat , like something had gone wrong with it . but with a very aggressive pour i managed to get a thin head that turned into a thin ring around the glass . this is probably the only bland feature of the beer . it just looks kind of flat .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : copper in color with minimal head and virtually zero lacing .	0000000000000
0	a : brass in color with a quickly vanishing head .	00000000000
1	a : a fairly rough , careless pour produces a perfect two-finger head of tight tan foam above a clear dark amber body . average retention and some spotty lacing . maybe not as lace-heavy as i 'd like , but a great looking beer nonetheless .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours into an osa tumbler a dark bronze with slight red highlights . the head is creamy and blonde in color and starts out at over 2 fingers in height . it shrinks down a bit but continues to hold firm the entire way down the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : pours a cloudy reddish amber with hardly any head at all .	00000000000000
0	appearance : well , the dang thing blew up on me as i opened the bottle . not sure why because it 's been siting in my basement for a while but it is n't the presentation kind of killed it for me . pours a hazy yellow/orange with way too much chunky white head .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy yellowish-orange color , the white head is minimal , the cap is persistent , and the lacing is adequate .	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : opaque black with chocolate brown head .	000000000
0	a : pours a light brown color that is close to a dark orange . there is no head or carbonation to be found . it looks very still and dull .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pour is clear golden with a very large , kind of sparkeling thick head . dissipates slowly into quite nice ladings .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark brown in the glass with a 1 finger tan head that leaves some great lacing behind after a short while .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy orange-brown ale , a vigorous pour into a tulip kicked up a very brief and bubbly head which was gone within a minutes . looks more syrupy than it tastes . b : scents you 'd expect from a pumkpin ale , but with a sharp spice note that sets it apart - clove , i suppose	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : nearly opaque ... a deep rusty brown where it does come through . almost white head which does n't last long or impress much	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : well , not called big head because of the foam pillow . thin head on top of apple juice color and the head dribbles out to naught . lacing holds on for dear life . n : my god , is the nose on this beatiful . if i could bottle this or use as an air freshener i would . ive heard description before of mowed grass , this one has it combined with pure pink grapefruit . the malt and alcohol are there too but wow with the fruity hops .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : small but long lasting creamy head , dark red cedar brown in color . pitch black body . lacing is spare . s &	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : golden-bronze with a fluffy , white head . great retention & lace . exceptional .	00000000000000000
0	appearance : looks like cola when light passes through the beer as it 's poured . much lighter in color than i 'd anticipated . bold coffee-colored once in the glass with tinges of ruby . not opaque . one finger of head quickly falls to a thin layer of splotchy foam , and then to a circle of foam around the inside of the glass . on a related note , many of the labels of the other bottles on the store shelf were torn for some unknown reason . i now see that there appears to be dried beer on the outside of the bottle , presumably from the ( hand ? ) bottling process . the notion that this was hand bottled is appealing , but the appearance of the outside of the bottle is amateurish and reminds me of my early bottles of home brew . flavor : not nearly as complex as the aroma , unfortunately . light molasses sweetness up front . boozy alcohol then creeps in , and is followed by a very slight but noticeable metallic twang . the finish is bittersweet and hot . the flavor of this brew is reminiscent of dfh world wide stout ( `` did someone dump a shot of vodka in my stout ? `` ) , but is slightly better imo .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : looks great , just like a dark belgian ale should . dark brown with a bit of a misty look	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : the beer pours clear with an ample white head . the retention is completely ridiculous and the lacing is superb as well .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : light orange color , slightly hazy , one finger off-white head with killer retention time , excellent lacing .	000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear gold with a fizzy minimal white head that does n't make it past 2 seconds .	000000000000000000000
0	a : ruddy , vaguely hazy complexion reminds me of apple cider.. low carbo and hardly any head or lacing	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : wow , i 'm not sure what happened to this beer -- it was stored right along side the other four -- but as soon as i popped the cap , foam came pouring out like a science-project volcano . as i write this review , the beer has been sitting in its glass for at least fifteen minutes and there 's still a big , frothy head on it . colorwise , it 's similar to the rest , a dark gold , but is noticeably cloudier than its brethren .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a reddish honey color , somewhat cloudy with under a finger of white head . no lacing , next to no film .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : muddy light brown body with no head whatsoever . kinda ugly , but what do you expect for a beer this old and strong ?	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : jet black with a decent tan head , good lacing .	0000000000000
0	appearance : cola-ish dark brown with slight hints of crimson , soapy bubbles with little to no head retention .	00000000000000000000

1	appearance : a crystal clear , golden amber beer . the widget produced a super dense and creamy head . the beautiful cascading action settled down into a two-finger head that just sat there . it showed no signs of dissipating at all before i took a drink . even as i polished off the last drop of liquid , a good finger of head was still present . it left solid sheets of foam stuck to the sides of the glass in its wake .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : how the hell do i rate this one ? i poured about an ounce into a 12oz glass , and the glass overflowed . the head explosion was a joke ! it took me about 5-10 minutes to fit the entire thing into the glass . eventually , i got an extremely sticky , rocky , white head with lacing soapy lacing , and a clear goldish-orange liquid underneath . while one wiseman says the head was a bad joke ( rates it a 1 ) , i thought it was quite funny and give it a 3.5 . after it settled , it looked like soapy urine . we averaged out the score to give it a 2 .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : pellucid dark brown with some mahogany traits when backlit . breaking tan colored head builds quickly but like a soda it soon rescinds to leave only a thin covering , and with further time it breaks down to just a sad looking halo . low on carbonation but a gentle swirl reinstates a coca-cola like appearance , which soon fizzes back to how it was . no lacing whatsoever . a little more head retention would have been nice .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : clear , light amber color with two fingers of eggshell-tinted foam head that diminishes to a thick half-dollar sized pad . heavy lacing remains on the glass and scattered solitary bubbles rise infrequently .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear golden amber , minimal head and very little retention . quite flat looking	0000000000000000
0	a : this beer is definitely took `` extra pale '' seriously , it hardly has a color at all ... weak , quickly receding head . the only thing saving it from the lowest rating are the pretty carbonation bubbles .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : great looking beer ! pours a cloudy straw color with a puffy white head that hangs around for quite a while and leaves plenty of lacing along the side of the glass	0000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pour is a very deep dark brown and starts with a 1/2 finger , light tan head that is creamy looking , but fades almost immediately to nothing but a thin ring around the surface and a light whisp that is unevenly distributed over the top ; body is nearly opaque with the exception of some deep ruby highlights taht appear when held to the light that offer up a glimpse of what looks like pretty strong carbonation ; lots of spotty lacing is left on the sides of the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured like liquid evil , slow and black as tar . a firm drop in the last bit trying to raise a head showed a brief flash of deep tan froth that slipped quickly back into the ooze from whence it came . my mug looks like a black hole . bright light showed about a millimeter of clear black that a few carbonation bubbles could be seen , but not else . stuff looks freakin ' great ! flavor : burnt coffee bitter is quickly soothed by slightly sweet roasted malt base and dark chocolate . the flavor is simple but delicious . the back end has a wet hop light bitter to give the beer a wonderfully round profile .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a slightly cloudy amber / orange body with a huge , fluffy off-white head that fills most of the 1l glass . it collapses into a thick clump on top of the brew , and leaves substantial sheets of lacing and register marks down the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : dense , pillowy , three-finger white head w/ great retention . thick rings of foam are left behind as i drink this one . body is a deep , clear gold . great looking beer ! flavor : honey sweetness is well-balanced w/ spicy , fruity hops . interestingly , i 'm picking up a cotton candy note as the hop flavor intermingles with the malt . at the end , a nice , strong bitterness rises up and stays through a long finish .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : the body is a fairly typical black with clear red-brown highlights when held up to light ; above is a lovely 1 '' head of tight , creamy , light-brown foam that delivers very good retention and leave some spotty lace . good looking stout in a great looking glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a pale orange with a big-bubbled single finger of head . i poured in and then opened my computer , and the head is already gone gone gone . very clear as well . in this heat ( 97f as i type ) , this beer looks beautifully refreshing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : served up a clear , fairly bright mahogany body with a slim , ivory-hued head . looks like an amber ale . taco mac staff has been known to goof now and again , though , a quick double-check was made to confirm that this was , indeed , the watership `` brown '' .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured a dark brown hue and thinner than what i had originally anticipated . after letting the beer settle for a few moments , i noticed the lack of head and lacing ... which was bit disappointing as well .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : got to say i am digging the beer from the pour . the beer pours a clear dark amber coloration . the carbonation is active and plays with the light in the room . the head is a monster . i am looking at about 3.5 fingers of amber / tan head . the retention is fantastic . the lacing on my glass is like pancake batter . a visual treat for the beer lover in me .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a pretty cloudy burnt copper color with a thick 1 '' head of creamy white foam . as the head fades a little it is leaving a thick wall of lace on the side of the glass . overall , this is a nice looking beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a nice golden amber with a lot of long-lasting head that leaves behind some nice lacing . probably , one of the best looking beers i 've seen . nice , simple bottle , too .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : slightly opaque and a medium copper color . the head was a nice solid inch thick with almost completely homogenous bubbles of a medium size . as the head slowly dissipated some of the bubbles combined to form larger ones and a few bigger bubbles dotted the top of the foam . the strong head also leads to some very nice lacing . in fact , this is some of the finest lacing i 've ever seen . it is very thick and bubbly and covers about 60 % of the backside of the glass all the way down to the bottom . it is gorgeous .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a clear amber with a finger of long-lived cream-colored head . initially it deposits some nice sticky lace on the glass , though that ceases as i get past the first 25 % or so .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dark black in color . the black is nice and glossy , pretty vibrant for . . . black . there is no seeing through this for sure . the head was a bit disappointing . it built incredibly slowly but brought up a fluffy dark brown color . sadly , it does n't last but for a couple minutes . it falls to a thin ring with a very thin mass in the center floating around . lace slides back into the glass , but it is very spotty as it goes up . the reason it slides back in is because this beer is oily slick . leaves a thin and clear film on the glass , keeping any stickiness from happening . it still looks good , just wish the head was a bit more .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : amber , sometimes more of a reddened macro lager look to it . little head , on the first pour i turned my back and before i had an opportunity to consider it , there was none . when poured strongly for my second glass where it gave a white head with little retention and no lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : does n't explode out of the bottle like some of the 8 and 10 did . pours a lovely mahogany with red hues . the carbonation is strong , creating a bubbly , champagne-like head initially . the head unfortunately dies after a few seconds into nothing . the bubbles continue to eminate from the bottom of the glass however .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours pitch black with a finger of dense tan head . retention is nice .	00000000000000000
0	a : clear bright red body with an inch of bubbly pink foam that quickly disappears completely . ok , but slightly better retention would have been nice - that head was beautiful for the few seconds it lasted !	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : nothing great here , pale yellow , decent carbonation .	000000000000
1	a : beautiful translucent orange-copper colored body . cream-colored , small-bubbled foam makes up an impressive 1 1/2 finger head that never dissipates . leaves sticky rings of lace all the way down the glass . i find it impossible to believe that a beer of this style could look any better than this .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : clear golden color . fluffy white head when cracked , thins fast .	000000000000000
1	a : hard to know if this is the 'correct ' look or not ... beautiful auburn-amber hue , crystal clear and cut by a multitude of cascading carbonation stream . all this occurs beneath a gigantic rocky head of ivory seafoam - over 3-fingers - which drops slowly , leaving plenty of sparkling lace . i do n't know if it *should* have such a massive head ( it has been at least 5 months since our trade ) , but i honestly do n't care ; it 's quite pretty all the same .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : black . an aggressive pour creates about a finger 's worth of dark brown head that lasts for a minute or two . the lacing is quite prominent for the style . this is what an imperial stout should look like .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured chilled into a room temp pint glass with a full tan head that stays throughout the session . carbonation appears medium to high . color is black .	0000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours into my new belgium tulip a crystal clear yellow gold . a giant , rocky , white head forms on top and does n't really shrink at all because of the nucleation site in the glass constantly refreshing it . the lacing down the sides hardly lets any glass show whatsoever through the wall of white foam .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : dark as hell obviously but what surprised me was how aggressive the head was . i poured fairly gently and almost overflowed after 2 inches . it is the brownest head i have ever seen . really does look like milk chocolate . tilt the glass and the head does n't even move ! it is like cement . anyways not too many beer overly impress me here .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : kind of looks like flat guinness extra stout . nearly jet black , but actually dark dark brown . no carbonation or head retention , which creates the flat look . i 'll give this the benefit of the doubt ... maybe it was just a bad pour .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a dark brown porter that kept a decent finger and a half rustic head . light penetrates the sides of the beer to give it a very cola look , it comes off as a bit light in the visual for the style . the movement of the beer itself also makes me scratch my head a bit ; just so thin .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : i decided to pur this british ale into a brooklyn brewery imperial pint glass . out of this can comes a beer that was a dark yellowish amber color . the color of this beer was nice , but it does n't compare to the head of foam . this beer had one of the creamiest heads of foam i 've seen on a beer . that was thanks to the nitro widget inside the can . when it was poured , the glass filled up with nothing but foam . but then the foam slowly started receding and filling up with beer . it was like watching a beer show ! i almost forgot to mention that the head of foam was a light tan color at first , but then turned into a solid white color . if that was n't enough for my eyes , the head of foam was long lasting and left behind a ton of milk like streaks of white lace around the glass . it was truly an exceptional appearance .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : thick flakes of something make the rounds in a dark cloudy orange glass . solid finger of meringue head laces heavily . flakes are dark , they dont look like protein coagulation , a bit disturbing . as the head settles , there are dark particulates suspended in it like dirty snow . flavor : heavy bittering hop , firm tea flavor , mild malt base . theres a heavy orange peel element and some earthy tea flavors that make me think english hops . as it warms up a bit , some of the worty under-attenuated malt flavor comes out .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : clear amber with two-finger , off-white , creamy head that lasted . nice lacing .	00000000000000000
1	appearance : good-looking , overall . the body is clear and sparkling with bubbles , and is almost identical in color to grain belt premium . head poured about 1.5 fingers thick and rocky , and receded over about 5 minutes to fine film .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : wow , this one really lets off a bit of fizz when poured into the glass but the head dissipates in the same violent fashion that it poured ... disappointing . the body is golden bordering on a certain yellow colour that we 've all seen before while going to the loo . the head is straight white .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : clear golden orange body with very faint head . no retention and little lacing .	00000000000000000
1	a : it 's a darker shade of brown , but not black . it is transparent and has a very nice thumbs width white head that stays up and leaves good lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : pours a medium amber body with a tiny head that quickly disappears and leaves no lacing	000000000000000000
0	a : the beer is a cloudy pale tannish color . almost light brown , sort of orange . odd color here . not the most appealing , but not too far from an average witbier . head was 3 fingers and pure white with ok retention .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : not the most attractive beer . it pours a turgid yellow amber , sort of a dark goldenrod , with the majority of the turgidity likely being the result of the yeast kick in the finish , though likely not all of it . the initial pour - even split among three glasses - yields a nice , initially fluffy head , sort of a dull white , but it ends up fading fairly quickly , fizzing , bubbling down in to nothingness . no lacing and no surface dusting of which to speak renders this one fairly average-looking .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a mildly hazy golden straw yellow with a half inch head that fades into a white ring but still leaves a decent amount of lacing behind on the glass . not much yeast for a belgian style ale .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : copper colored with a towering off white head that dissipates halfway and then lingers , great lacing . nice looking beer .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours cloudy , murky , dark yellow , with a fizzy head that disappears after a few seconds , almost like soda pop . there is what looks like an underwater vent of bubbles coming to the top , which was cool , but overall , not impressive .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : deep red or dark brown . very thick , light caramel head that settles like a guiness . nice looking beer .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a fresh lemonade like murky , pale yellowish hue ; a nice , thick and creamy foamy beer head sustains on top of abundant fizziness . looking very nice indeed .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : : clear , amber colour , little head .	00000000000

1	a : a dark beer with red hues shining through the edges . a 2+ inch tan head that fades quickly to small bubbles atop the brew . very good .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : two finger head of nice soft cream , decent thickness , and average retention . colour is a clear yellow . sm : souring hops , cream , and light non-citrus esters . aroma is moderate in strength .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dark murky brown with hints of ruby and a one finger head that fades very quickly to a thin ring around the edge of the glass . decent lacing , but nothing standout .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : cap pulls with the faintest of hisses , and the cork releases no sound to speak of . the copper hued nectar pours lifelessly into the glass , with only thick chunks of sediment to break the monotony .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : big , foamy white head with deep amber/reddish color - almost copper . a rather dark lager , and has a look of being `` heavy bodied . ''	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours an opaque , jet black color . a two finger beige head forms with good retention . as the rocky foam gently recedes , sticky lace is left behind .	000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : cloudy orange amber in color with no head , just a spot or two of foam . no carbonation bubbles seen at all .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear golden apple-juice color with a fairly large and frothy bright white head that slowly receded into a thin film that left streaks of bubbly lacing . head is not nearly as rocky and billowing as i would have liked , the retention sucks , and the lacing disappears very quickly . bottom of the bottle yielded no yeast , not sure what others are talking about .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a medium amber with a very light off-white head .	0000000000000
0	a : pours an extremely deep red which , had i not held it up to the light , i would have thought was black , pours with a finger of big bubbled mocha brown colored head that dissipates pretty quickly , leaves a small amount of spotty lacing	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : golden with a slight copper colour to the body . the blonde head began at around 2cm and dissipated to fine lacing .	0000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very pale yellow with a small head that does a quick disappearing act .	0000000000000000

0	appearance : when i poured half of this bottle into a pint glass it actually looked like one of the bud light drafts i pour at work . that said , bud light draft generally looks way better than it actually is . the demolition was very light in color with a consistent carbonation with a very thin , but ( big bubbles ) bubbly head .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours with just over 1 finger of white head , not nearly that normally associated with a hefeweisen . this settles to essentially nothing , leaving the barest of rings around the glass . the beer itself is pale yellow and cloudy . interestingly , the pour was like amny hefe in thatt he last swirl of the can produced some yeast sediment to pour .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : cloudy orange , thick foam head which rescends rockily .	000000000000
0	appearance : pours with 1 inch of light tan head . this settles slowly , leaving behind nice sticky lacing . the beer itself is a nice orange/amber , with just a hint of chill haze .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : nothing to brood about , clear red with a lemony-coarse head ; this does n't speak to me , but i reserve each beer of purchase for varied stable of minds .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this ale has a pale amber color .	0000000000
1	appearance : i love the way this beer looks . it 's almost a solid black color , but it takes a couple minutes for the head to settle and while it 's settling , you get that crazy foam flowing throughout the beer . i think it 's beautiful .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : golden with a finger of white foam which falls nearly immediately to a broken sheet of the same with cobweb lace . nearly murky .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : brownish amber , hardly any head . looks very much like an oktoberfest .	0000000000000000
0	appearance : cloudy dark golden liquid with a small white head . poor retention for a belgian beer . very little in the way of lacing .	000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : just gorgeous . a copper , amber , ruby glass crowned with a clumpy tan , slightly red head that fades slowly leaving great loops of lace as it fades . flavor : hop on pop ! rich hop flavor but backed by a rich malt base . the rye comes out nicely . the overall taste is that of sugared hops , a great blending of basic beer goodness .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : the usual cascading appearance that a nitro gives ; the glass becomes completely enveloped in the foamy head that quickly dissipates into a clear dark golden hue , with a solid bone white one finger head that does n't let up . moderate amount of lacing left as i drink . really spectacular looking .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear golden yellow color . first pour gave about three fingers of white frothy head with pretty good retention and some spotty lacing . 3.0	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : the beer pours a deep brown color , maybe medium brown , not dark , and has a small off-white colored head , but the head quickly recedes and turns to nothing ...	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : probably what i liked the most about this brew . poured a dark brown that could barely be seen through.the head was a 1 '' tan head that disappeared fast . the lacing was tight and present all the way down to the end of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear light amber	00000

1	a : very clear , orange-copper tone with a fluffy white head , great retention and lace . exceptional .	00000000000000000000
0	a : pours a hazy gold color into a pint glass . having this on tap , i expected a little more head . i got absolutely none . the bartender filled it so high that i did n't dare reach over the person who was sitting at the bar to get it . luckily she handed it to me .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours an almost entirely opaque murky mud-water color . minimal head did not retain for long . definitely got some yeast ? ( or so other particulates ) floating around as well as resting on the bottom of my glass . very fine carbonation bubbles slowly trickling tot the surface .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : thick honey-amber with short and quickly dissipating off-white head with minimal lacing .	000000000000000
1	appearance : opaque and black , with soft hints of red and/or mahongany . thin tan head which does not stick around very long . does n't look overly thick or too thin , i like the look of this brew .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : amazing creamy white head and excellent lacing . the beer is colored straw golden . strangely lighter than most ipa 's .	000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a black color with a creamy tan head ; tiny bubbles galore , great retention and good lacing	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a crystal clear golden-orange ( more orange than gold ) , with lots and lots of bubbles and two fingers of slowly dissipating frothy white head . incredibly thick lacing . beautiful looking beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : off-white head , tinted brown like dirty snow ( i do not miss michigan right now : ) . creamy and frothy as could be . extreme bubbles rising to the top making for wonderful cloudy head retention . body is murky brown color with a dark amber hue .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark , muddy amber . thin tan head . pretty gross in my glass , but i got some of the dregs ; other tasters ' samples looked significantly better . i 'll average things out to average .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear brown orange ; good head but it dissipates quickly and looks thin ; carbonation action decent	0000000000000000000
1	appearance : very deep black ( it almost looks brown a little around the edges ) and makes my pint glass ( yes , i had a full pint of this bad boy ! ) look like an opaque plastic cup . very rich and thick brown frothy head that took quite a while to settle . it does have a somewhat red wine looking coloration on the edges of the glass as you drink it . very deep and looks the part .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : really good , actually . rich , clear , cola red with a thick tan head . very good retention . moderate to mild carbonation . no lace , but a collar throughout . smell . again , really good . dense nose of caramel malt , red apple yeast , fruit juice , and a slight hint of smoke . oddly , no real hop notes . taste/mouthfeel : good mouthfeel , slightly thin , but a bit coating and crisp -- yeah . taste starts with a good mouthful of chewy malt , tart and juicy mid-palette , a bit yeasty , with a nice shot of ever-so-english-tasting bittering hops to dry out the finish . once again ...	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a slightly hazy golden color with a thin spotty white head . pretty much no head at all , but i did n't really expect very much . some tiny bubbles cling to the side of the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pale yellow , fast fading head to nothing .	00000000000
0	a : could pass as a coca-cola , dark brown but not quite black . very clear/clean . slight off white head when poured into glass , no retention after a minute . lasting ring throughout enjoyment .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : this ale comes rushing out of the gates with excitement only to fizzle down to nothing like a horse i decided to back in a race . the body is cloudy orange with a pale though nonexistent head .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear , pale goldenrod body with a short-lived finger of off-white head capping the brew . no lacing .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a beautiful , golden , amber , great clarity in the beer , glass-like , with a beautiful , thick , white head , which lasts for the whole glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : glowing amber in color with some brownish hues . 1.5 inches of beige , creamy head . lovely coat of creamy lacing at first , which fades to sticky rings further down the glass . one of the best looking beers i 've seen .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : the beer is a murky brown with little head and only a bit of lacing , not an appealing start .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : ruby color , not much head and it goes quickly and leaves no lacing .	00000000000000000
0	a : surprisingly enough , this beer is n't pitch black but is a very dark brown . very aggressive pour did n't give much of the beige head and the little i had did n't last very long . super low lacing considering the residual sugars that this beer shows .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : extremely gorgeous . rich deep deep pure red color . not brown at all , only red . the head is off-white and strong , even if the brew does n't look much carbonated at first .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a dark , dark brown , that looks black in the glass and lets no light through . two fingers of a chocolate brown head that receded fairly quickly , but left a decent bit of lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : friggin wax coated neck took me about four minutes to break through . once i did , it pours a beautiful hazy caramel color with an abundantly foamy head that lingers a very long while . the lacing sticks to the glass like few beers i have seen .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours blackness like a storm . a large fluffy dark tan head . lacing and retention is brilliant .	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a clear reddish amber color with a respectable 1/2 '' of off white foam on top that is thick and creamy and looks like it will be there for a while . there are quite a few bubbles rising , and they stick once they make it to the top . there is quite a bit of lace left on the glass after drinking . almost through with the beer , there is still a pretty solid layer of foam on top of the beer , so overall this is a pretty nice looking beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : to be quite honest with you it looks like i pissed in the glass . very thick urine yellow with a thick head .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : this beer looked great , but looks can be deceiving . a wonderful clear amber color , and a thick white head .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : black color . two and a half fingers of frothy/creamy tan head with great retention and a thick ring of lacing . good looking brew ! 3.5	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this is one of the enduring things i like about killian 's . the say irish red , and they mean it . it a deep red with brown highlights , sporting a 2-finger white head . lacing and head fade quickly , but it 's because it 's more like a micro-carb than anything .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : liquid ink , with an angry pallour . i am unsure if ink can be pissed off , but i feel like the slight bubbles are mocking me but they rise slowly and linger as if they dont care in their murky depths . there 's some carbonation but it is spiteful in nature .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a pale straw color with a one-finger white head ; slightly opaque .	0000000000000000
1	appearance : very respectable murky peach , topped with a perfect head well woven honeycombs and plenty of effervescence . it does n't get much better than this for the style , at least to my liking .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours an amber body with a small , white head but not very good retention and minimal lacing tunil the finish .	000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a slightly hazy reddish-brown body with what is at least initially a good , tan , one-finger head . retention is average , fading in about a minute , and the lacing is similarly runny , fast-fading . not a great start .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : looks really nice , big deep orange hazy , with a huge sticky head . very nice .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : crystal clear yellow glass with the thinnest of white heads that showed no lace . flavor : clean macro lager taste with a spot of grain . nothing to fault , nothing to love .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a crystal-clear golden-amber body capped by about a finger and a half of pillowy off-white head that leaves great lacing on the way down .	000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : this beer had no head when i poured it , it was a nice black thick beer though .	000000000000000000000
0	appearance : the beer pours a very light yellow color with a good amount of carbonation . it almost appears too light , even for the style .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : the pour into my pilsner glass gives a huge , slightly off-white , meringue like head . it takes quite awhile for it to recede enough for me to take a sip . great lacing . the beer is a pale golden amber in color .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a dark brown color like mahogany with a thin white head that is bubbly . there is carbonation in the beer . the clarity of the beer is clear .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : not exactly the prettiest of beers , its an awfully hazy pale orange with a head that needs some nourishment . retention was ko , and lacing was good , but still , this beer looks kinda bad . i guess i should n't expect a clean , refined look from a `` wild ale ''	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a murky apricot-straw body with very little head , no retention , no lace . this might be an old beer , especially since it 's retired , but they sold it at the brewery recently , so ... .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : from great divide 's new labels , old ruffian is probably the most beautiful looking barleywine i 've poured . it appears a clear deep ruby red color with a very nice amount of carbonation that forcefully makes its way up and out of the glass . there is also a substantial amount of light and frothy tan-colored head that is accompanied by an unyielding amount of lacing . the lacing as it slowly drags down the side of the glass has a sparkly ( or sugary ) effect . very nice .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear golden color with a decent head	00000000000
0	a : 1/2 inch of white head with large bubbles that drops quickly to a ring with thing film of bubbles on top . color is dark brown with nice highlights around the edges .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this is one of the best looking beers i can recall drinking . brilliant copper/orange color . 1 '' of dense marshmallow colored foam that dissipates down to a thin white layer of sea foam covering half of the surface area and laces nicely to the side of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : loads of tiny bubbles fill a murky brown-red body with off-white foam that just sits there with amazing retention and spidery lacing .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a light golden yellow hue with a medium white head . no lace .	00000000000000000
1	appearance : pours ( from a rock-heavy bottle -- what 's up with that ? ) a surprisingly ( for the style , anyway ) deep , clear straw gold . big fizzy head comes ... and goes . not too bad .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this beer poured an exceptionally dark-brown derived black . even holding it up to a light , i can only see a ring of brown translucence around the very top of the beer . not artificially jet-black like some beers , just so ridiculously brown to be almost entirely opaque black . beautiful . a thick tan head stuck around for a minute or two , dissolving to a ring that hung on for the rest of the beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : one finger , thick head of fair retention . not particularly impressive . sm : caramel ; a bit devoid of hops actually . fresh barley . medium strength scent , all things considered .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours an extremely unfiltered straw color . was expecting some haze , an extreme yeast presence . about 1/2 '' of eggshell white head forms that has poor lacing and retention .	0000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours opaque and seemingly viscous and black , yet very little head and no lacing . is low carbonation meant to be ? who knows , but i know this was quiet fresh ...	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pale golden yellow colour , two fingered head forms from a spritzy big bubbled carbonation . very thin sprinkled white lace is left , something is better than nothing right ?	000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : starts out looking brown until the nitrogen bubbles propagate on the top of the brew . then it is rather black with a thin , very creamy , resilient white head on top . the foam coats the sides of the glass while drinking .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear , light amber color with one finger of white foam head . heavy sheets of lacing remain on the glass . the appearance of this beer is as close to the ideal of the style as any yet seen .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : yellow straw color with a small head .	0000000000
1	a : deep tan/amber , glows red in the light , mostly clear , full one-inch head with amazing retention , stong on bubbly carbonation	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark cherry red in color . the head was minimal , and because of the gushing , there was massive amounts of sediment and even some hop leaves floating around in the glass , this one was ugly .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dark reddish amber color that is transparent . little to no head .	00000000000000000

1	appearance : lightly hazed dark gold color , giant white head , fills the stop of the glass nicely .	00000000000000000000
1	appearance : crystal clear golden yellow beer with a persistent 1/8 '' dense white head . strands , walls , and islands of lacing as i drank it down were seen . when held up to the light along with the plentiful bubbles you can see what looks like a faint peach color to the beer - making the beer almost a rose gold in color . a nice looking beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : beautiful ruby red/orange color with a thin white head made of lots of tiny bubbles . head retention is almost non-existant though . some visible carbonation bubbles .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : encouraging medium amber that grew a little more opaque as it it warmed . a solid fingers worth of head quickly retreated but retained some solid lacing until the final moments .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : light gold in body with a white , creamy thin head .	00000000000000
0	a : pours a clear golden color with very little carbonation and a thin layer of white head . lacing is good until about half way down glass , then it turns to nothing . t/m : crisp with a mostly grainy sweet malt taste . goes down with an easy not too overpowering hop taste and feel . finishes with a bitterness that is not overpowering at all . clean aftertaste .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : minimal head formation takes place upon first pour ; the retention is also minimal and lacing is virtually non-existant . the color is a very pale , translucent yellow . carbonation is also minimal .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours light golden yellow , hazy , 2+ finger white fluffy head that sticks around a while and leaves good lacing .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy yellow-gold . pours a half finger head that dissipates before i can note any of its characteristics . appealing in a general sense - it 's beer anyway . sm : peach and malt dominate . maybe some apricot esters creep in ; perchance the yeast affected the peach in a certain way to cause this . a moderate strength aroma .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours a big billowing two finger super thick looking tan/brown head with great retention . poured out looking like thick black sludge . jet black with next to zero carbonation evident . head slowly fades to a decent film cap that remains the whole way and leaves sheets of nice lacing down the sides of the glass . gorgeous looking , and exactly like the oak aged variant .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : wow , really clear , almost crystal , bright crimson red . one of the most beautiful looking krieks ive seen . fluffy pink head that creates a nice layer but reduces prompty to a foamy blanket on the surface . 5	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : crystal clear bright gold that sparkles . pours big dense pure white head that drops down to a finger/finger-half that is very stubborn . some lace and lots of carbonation . best looking export lager ever .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pretty standard for a pa. orange , a little lacey .	0000000000000
0	a : dark reddish amber . very fizzy head which almost immediately turns into nothing with little to no lacing .	000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poor head , no lacing , and almost no pigment .	0000000000000
0	appearance : clear brown in color with a short 1/2 head . the head falls quickly . no lacing develops .	000000000000000000000
1	a : the bottle looks great : 75 cl . with a cork and steel cage . when you `` pop '' it and starts pouring it 's pure amber with a medium large head that leaves some lacings .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : thick black with a nice , full half-inch of cream-colored head that remains big the entire way down . generous clumps of thick lacing down the entire glass . gorgeous-looking stout .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : light brown with a big head that leaves a lot of lace	00000000000000
0	a : pours a murky , hazy orange-brown color . not much in the way of head , although the little that there is has a similar tint and a sudsy texture . retention is mediocre , with a bit of lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : part of a mixed sampler pack . i chose to pour this in a pint glass . dark brown body , shows some reddish tints in the light . a foreceful pour gives rise to a nice 3/4 '' of dark tan head that has above average retentioin and laces down the insides of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a hazy orangish yellow color . provides a thick off-white foam head that had moderate retention . there is some lacing as well .	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours brilliantly clear copper , fading off-white head	0000000000
1	a : it just does not get much better than the look of this stuff in a pint glass . jet black ... amazing tan head .	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : black pour , medium brown , dense head . terrific looking .	00000000000000
0	a : pours a completely opaque brown with faint orange highlights . 2-finger head settles into a 1/2 finger cap , leaving no lacing on the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dull golden hue with a minimal lacing that ends up to be just a ring around the glass .	000000000000000000000
0	a : pours type black with a minimal if any type of head . just a smattering of bubbles . not a great start , but it 'd change my mind .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : free pour yields a tiny offwhite head that disappears immediately . pours a dark blackish red brown . no lacing . considering this is n't an unblended lambic or something , looks like something went wrong .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : thick white head that recedes fairly quickly , golden straw color , nice lacing	0000000000000000

1	a : clear copper color . nice , this is one good looking beer .	000000000000000
1	a : the ale is a deep amber red color with orange hints and a 1 finger head that does not retain well .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : with the risk of an overflow in mind , a gentle pour produces a meager finger of bright white head that is quick to recede . a high level of carbonation is apparent and a steady stream of bubbles adds life to the thin collar that rests along the glass 's edge . ( lacing is highly unlikely . ) the body has an elegant ros color , approaching pale , and is medium-light in saturation . gorgeous . the last pour deposits suspended yeast sediment and likens the appearance to that of all natural grapefruit juice . despite the spare head and lack of lacing , on the merits of the body 's color alone , the beauty of this beer can not be denied .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : no head , no lace , no nothing , just yellow water	00000000000000
0	appearance : color is golden orange , not red at all . lots of carbonation flowing upward from the bottom of the glass . one finger white , pillowy head with decent retention .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured a nice little head but dissipated too quickly leaving no lacing . hay-like color . a little too light for a pilsener and looks somewhat bland .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours an opaque , dirty and dull yellow with straw highlights . little to no head .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : 2.0	000
1	a : pours a very dark red color that could be mistaken for a murky brown . a nice one finger head sits on top and turns into a beige colored film . nice thick lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : thick foamy head slowly settles to a nice layer , ruby red color , pretty stream of bubbles in the middle	00000000000000000000000
0	a : slightly hazy yellowish orange . slight 1/4 finger white head that disappears instantly . almost no lacing to speak of .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : light pour , very nice foam head , white . very dark red , not a whole lot of light passes through this beer .	000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a dark red , but mostly brown color with absolutely no head . this might be a bad bottle . it is a little cloudy but shows no other signs of life .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the pour is light golden with a pretty large airy white head that dissipates after a little while , leaving nice lacings .	0000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : medium copper color with a pretty small whitish head dissipating quickly .	00000000000000
1	appearance : pours a hazed sunset orange , light hazy yellow to darker , hazier orange nearer the top , which is capped by a good two-fingers of foamy , white head that more `` melts '' than fades . this speaks largely to the consistency of the head - it 's incredibly fine-bubbled , dense , almost like the cap on a root beer float . once it does begin to recede - more due to the receding volume of liquid than the natural fading of the head - it leaves loads of sticky , sudsy lacing , full in places , stringy in others . this one looks incredibly well-carbonated , as well , full of incredibly fast streams of average-sized carbonation . the lacing actually bears further mention . so i keep bottles . i save them . bottles of rare beers , of beers i 've tried that are particularly good , of beers that are n't distributed regularly in virginia , of beers that i 'm proud to have tried . one of these beers was the kuhnhenn raspberry eisbock . the kre smelled so good , so amazingly incredibly , so decadent , so opulent that i did n't wash it out before putting it on my display shelf . i would occasionally walk by and indulge my olfactory , and would invite guests and relations to do likewise . one day , a good three or four months after i 'd emptied the bottle of its contents ( largely ) , someone made the mistake of looking inside . that 's what the lacing on this beer looks like . a massive , sticky , clumpy , hairy mold , voluminous and chunky . anyway , back to the review .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : well ... it 's orange . it 's so fizzy it looks like there 's some kind of whirlpool in your glass . this sets the tone for what 's pretty much a standard lager on a tonne of steroids .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : i watched the bartender pour this beer in the proper manner and hand it right to me , but in that 10 seconds what head it had was already gone . what remained was a thin patch of scummy tan bubbles drifting around a molasses-colored morass of a beer . muddy and ugly .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : once served in a weissbier mug seems like cold coffee , very dark brown , almost black , no foamy head , just a few white burrs on the surface ;	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : bright orange off white head with a sponge type of bubbles	0000000000000
1	a : three fingers of gorgeous , tight head . so dense at the top i suspect it could support my weight . startling retention . the beer is opaque , coca-cola brown ( well , actually it 's several shades darker , bordering on black ) . smallish bubbles up the sides .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours an almost crystal-clear amber-copper with three fingers of frothy , foamy white head , good retention , and great lacing .	000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured a almost black colour w/ no head to speak of . no head ... no lacing ... no little ring makes me sad	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark golden-copper body with two fingers of white fluffy head . retention is great along with amazing thick lacing .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : whoa ! pours very hazy and honey in color . the head is massive and craggy with little flecks of sediment held in suspension . super aggressive carbonation froths about below the surface of the liquid . the head lasts forever and leaves an impressive amount of lacing . simply beautiful .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : wow , awesome looking brew , it is a hazy brown color with a tan head that is an inch thick , and i mean thick and rocky and creamy and all the things you dream of the head on a beer to be . when i think of a 5 out of 5 this is what i hope for . i hope for a good solid color and a head that makes me thirsty	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a clear golden color with a thick cream that rises to the top in layers much line a guiness does . there is a super thick creamy white head on top of the beer that is about 3/8 '' thick and looks like it is there to stay .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear golden straw color with a small head that fizzes and dissapated more like a soft drink then a beer , bubbles continue to rise from he sides of the glass	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : tall , frothy , meringuey head with great retention supported by a column of bubbles , rising like little sparks , in the center of a light , peachy whisky-colored body . almost belgian in appearance .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this looks great . an almost black color with some dark brown highlights . a huge head forms and sticks around to leave a coat of lace down the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : light golden , lighter than most pale ales ( extra pale in the title ) , slightly cloudy , white fizzy head with solid retention , not especially sticky .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : bottle , which is not nearly as nice looking as the can . dull gold , not much of a head .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : i love the way this beer looks in the bottle . the bottle has an individual style with simple graphics . plus the name screams that it should be a great beer . pours light golden color with no/very little head . nice czech pilsner carbonation .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : i did n't read the bottle and therefore did n't know it was bottle conditioned . needless to say i ended up with a lot of floaties . other than that it looks good . a thin white head tops a hazy dark orange beer . little visible carbonation .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours with a small bright white head that fades quickly to a collar , and lasts for some time after that . the body is a murky soft orange color with yellow tints and light brownish-grey flakes of sediment at the bottom . lacing between good and fair .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear yellow color . no head and no lace .	00000000000000
0	appearance : this was a dark brown beer that let plenty of filtered , red light through when it was held up to a lamp . a fizzy , light tan head rose up to only about a finger with an aggressive pour . it lost some of its coarseness and thickened up as it settled down . it dissipated rather quickly , though , and had dwindled down to just a thin ring of foam around the circumference of the glass before i had taken a drink . there was no lacing at all .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : the body is a rich dark brown , very nearly black outside of direct light , with reddish-brown highlights . on top , a two-finger caramel head that leaves decent lacing . this is a beautiful presentation .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : golden , slightly brownish amber . i gave it a hard pour , but it only resulted in an average head that quickly disappeared . i like the color , but the nearly total lack of head is a big minus .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a dark purple dingy looking beer . not much head despite trying to pour it rough .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a dark , dull orange-hued body gunked up with more than a fair share of over-sized particulate matter . thin , white head . now i wish i had n't taken a good look at it .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pitch black and viscous with a milky white head ... beautiful .	00000000000000
0	appearance : very dark brown to black , with only a small amber glow when held to light . lots of apparent carbonation on initial pour ; wondering if this is an older bottle that didnt age well . carbonation thankfully calms down swiftly . head is appropriately mocha tan , though only covers half the surface , unevenly . disappears completely midway through the drink . no lacing . 3.25/5	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : pours a hazy red orange with a nice inch and a half creamy off-white head in a stein mug . color is a little off . highlights are orange and the shadows are n't very red or amber either . head retention is good and lacing is pretty good . there is a suspended smokey shape in the middle of the brew .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pitch black , no head .	00000000
1	appearance : this is a dark beer . pours a flat black to be quite honest . cascading brown bubbles down the inside of the glass from top to bottom almost like a rip current effect . you wait the 60 seconds to 120 till the brew settles to a nice tight 1/2 inch thick white head . the finest amount of lacing with a lasting head that will drop to the bottom as you drink .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : a dark brownish/red color with no head at all .	000000000000

0	appearance : crystal clear , straw color . perfectly white head with good lacing . everything about the appearance screams `` macro '' .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : a fast pour into a pilsner glass shows clear gold beer body with a white head that vanishes right away .	00000000000000000000000
0	appearance : its really a clear amber . almost no pop when the cork comes out , and very little head , even when warmed up and with a vigorous pour . almost no lacing . below average for a belgian .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a dark brown with a tan fingers worth of head that fades to a film and leaves no lacing . smells : a sweet plum and caramel malt with little hop notes but a dark fruit like figs are apparent . tastes : this is a really malty brew . there is sweet dark fruit flavors and a maple hint that last trough to the aftertaste . there is a little hop character that is floral from what i pick up .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : yellow in color , amazing head with ok retention , fair lacing .	000000000000000
1	appearance : the beer is dark , dark brown , almost black . the tan head is about `` thick with the very fine bubbles characteristic of the nitro pour . as the foam recedes a bit there are ridges of foam around the glass and some trails of lacing . the head never does disappear completely .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a dark amber with a slight murkiness . a dense , foamy head left lots of sticky , eye-catching lacing .	000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : soft polished golden body with a fantastic well water clarity to it . pristine off-white pastel beige head with a light absorbing quality . head retention is purposeful whilst the conditioning is above average , a stiff swirl will produce a feisty head and a creamy body that has a resemblance to boddingtons from the nitro-tap .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pour a cloudy pale orange body with four fingers of beautiful white fluffy head . retention is great as is the lacing .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : gorgeous ! the body on this one shines like a masterpiece , a bright amber-orange . age may have given it an extra pop , as it shows consistent , heavy fizz through the body for the longest time . the head is a silky cream that leaves just a hint of micro-lacing . great retention and clarity give this a professional , aged look , as it should have . the imperial ipa has never looked better .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : bottle poured into harpoon pint glass . pours a dark brown-red , decent creaminess at the top .	00000000000000000000
1	a : each had the same appearance . very dark brown with some deep cherry and mahogany colors on the edges . light does n't come close to making it through in the middle . no carbonation . extremely viscous . as i gave it a little swirl , it stuck to the sides very easily .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : probably it 's weakest attribute - pours an unimpressive yellow/gold - very little head which fades instantly .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : beer is a faded golden colour with absolutely no head . so far , very uninviting .	0000000000000000000

0	a : a clear , golden yellow with a head that fades quickly .	00000000000000
0	a : for an amber this one is pretty pale . fluffy white head with a bit of carbonation . the color is really getting me here though . im having trouble believing this just poured from a bottle labeled amber .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : clear pilsner-like golden color that has a thin , dense white head , which leaves nice lacing .	00000000000000000000
1	a : wow , that 's a pretty ipa . caramel/copper with just a faint haze , crowned with a great 2-finger crown of light ivory . a little crackly , a little spongy-looking , it clings with a lovely lace on all sides . drops hesitantly to a creamy film , very little carbonation showing . otherwise , perfection ...	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : very good looking . copper color with a thick white head that quickly fades .	00000000000000000
0	appearance : a deep deep amber when some light comes through it . unfortunately there 's hardly any head on the beer . even with subsequent pours as it warms , hardly any lacing or head , which is really odd .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : straw colored , nice and clear with lots of rising carbontion . half an inch of foamy white head sits atop and leaves very big gobs of webbing behind	0000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : dark ruby in color , 1 finger tan head that stuck with it .	0000000000000000
1	a : pours a turbid ruby ale with a two finger peanut head . this falls slowly to a fluffy quilt of the same . nice orange-brown color where the light shines through near the edges . spotty lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : good foamy , white colored , long lasting head clarity is excellent : crystal clear . color is golden yellow . flavor : lots of spicy/peppery saaz hop flavor up front . something of a minerally character in the flavors . hop bitterness is moderately high , and lingers long in the finish ( ibu 40 , maybe ) . very clean lager like character . backed up with malt sweetness , but the hops dominate . mouthfeel & body : carbonation percieved as being fairly high , but saaz hops also contribute to the feeling . also somewhat minerally water gives it a dry , lending it a moderate-low mouthfeel and body .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : awesome head retention , i wait for a beer to come across with a head so perfect it makes me cry knowing i have to drink it . this is brussels lace . the vibrant brownish brick red colour embers in the light .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : pours a hazy but translucent dark ruby red , with a big 3 finger head that dissipates quickly like soda , lacing is an equally bubbly ring of lacing . plenty of visible bubbles from carbonation .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : an aggressive pour came out flat regardless . a few juice-like bubbles formed from the vigorous pour , but that 's all . no carbonation at all , pitch black in color . disappointing . hopes were shattered .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : has an unfiltered haze with a woody , tan color .	0000000000000
1	a : surpringly black , almost no ruby hues in this beer . very nice inch of creamy brown head . the head on this beer sticks around longer , and leaves more consistent lace behind than almost anything else . superb .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : body is cloudy golden white in color . head is fluffy white but not terribly long lasting , and the lacing is minimal . from the appearance i 'd think this to be a wit instead of a here , but it 's a nice color .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours an extremely deep ruby hue that seems to be kinda light brown around the edges . not much head to speak of , and it disappeared rather quickly . a few soda-like bubbles remain floating on the surface . no real lacing to speak of either .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : intimidating , huge , it 's a 40oz . it looks like trouble . it 's actually a apple juice color , few bubbles , no lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : poured pretty flat with a cherry-caramel dark brown hue with absolutely no head or lacing . a little disappointing to be honest , but due to the nature of this beer ... i ca n't be too sad about overall appearance too .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : light light yellow .	000000
1	a : the beer has a fabulous appearance . the liquid is completely opaque and extremely dark.the head is thick and dense , standing in at nearly two inches thick . as it gradually recedes , it utterly coats the glass with thick , sticky lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : deep copper , thinnest layer of head , sporadic bubbles , - 4.75 ,	0000000000000000

1	a : dark amber , white creamy head , dissolves quickly .	000000000000
1	appearance : the beer is a deep reddish brown color with amber highlights , somewhere between cola and strong iced tea . it never develops much of a head , though the thin cap of ivory foam hangs around for quite a while . the foam leaves attractive , generous lacing on the glass . this is a good start .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : hazy pale yellow with little white head .	0000000000

1	a : oh dear , i poured the beer before realised that i can not see through lacquered clay ... err , i 'm sure the body would appear amber as advertised ( actually it 's more of a `` caramel brown '' - i 've had this beer before ) . 2cm tan head that dissipates to a thin layer that leaves lacing in the chalice .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : well , i already covered this . what do you want me to say ? it looks perfect for the style ... but that 's only because some food scientist carefully formulated the amount of caramel color additive that they needed to make this beer look good .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : kind of a brownish/redish/purple ? an odd color . lots of bubbles and no head . flavor : spicey as all get out . roast and caramel . prunes . quite alcoholic . palate : at first its pretty silky and soft . then settles into an alcohol burn and is prickly on the tounge .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : awesome pinky size head that will not go down , lots of lacing left after each sip and a jet black color . what more do you expect from a draft ( nitro ) stout ?	00000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : very cloudy pale orange with visible sediment floating down by the bottom . a full two and a half fingers of soda-like head . appears to be highly carbonated .	00000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : nice two finger head . a light yellow color with a bit of carbonation .	00000000000000000
0	a : ... a touch of carbonation had presented itself . but do n't worry , your bottle is n't going to be the way it should be . by a touch i mean that even with a semi-aggressive pour , i managed only about 1/16 inch of head that was quickly pulled back into the black colored abyss . also of note , a chunk of some sort of sludge fell into the glass about 3/4 into the pour . images of triple bock plopped into my head as the sludge cake plopped into the glass . 4.5	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : i used to drink this beer frequently at this pub in singapore , and truth be told it is an exceptionally pretty looking beer . pours out a beautiful golden colour with lots of bubbles which dissipated quite quickly .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours turbid brown with subtle dark amber highlights . head is minimal .	000000000000000
1	a : beautifully clear pale amber hue , with a nice , muffin-like fluffy as well as frothy bear head , lasting extremely well and leaving wool fibre-like thick and tight lacing~~ sheer brilliant for a cask-conditioned ale .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a dark golden color with a little white head that disappeared quickly and even with a steady stream of bubbles coming from the etched d at the bottom of the duvel tulip no resemblance of a head is there .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : the pour is gorgeous ! as the dark chestnut brew hits the glass a wonderful three finger tan head rises up . the retention on this thing is amazing and it laces throughout .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the beer poured jet black with a two finger tan-colored head . it has excellent head retention -- a thick head constantly covered the surface all the way until it was all finished .	000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours a very clear dark amber that turns brilliant ruby red when held up to light . the head is a light beige , massive , and dense . it takes forever to drop . even then , a hearty cap stays with it the entire way down the glass and even leaves a few scant patches of lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : ruddy caramel pour , slight murky haze . very little head , a forgettable ringing sliver and a whisper of film . barely any lace , just a slim string that quickly droops . virtually still , almost no visible carbonation ; furthermore , there 's a fair amount of suspended yeasty dust . pretty color , but otherwise pretty disappointing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : liquid brain is deep brown , but not quite black , with mahogany highlights and a rich , tan head with quite a few large bubbles . right after the chalice was served , all of the big bubbles migrated to the rim , opening up the middle of the glass . for the first half a minute , they popped , sending little shockwaves of cream towards the center . i 've really never seen anything like this . ethanol `` legs '' stick to the glass like you 'd see in a typical mega-strength beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : pour gave a good finger head ( a relief given the bottle state ) but dropped back to the scantest of covers . goblet is dark brown with clear ruby edges . flavor : again , grapes lead the way for me . quickly following is a firm yeast note . the profile is much like a belgian strong dark ale ( ok , ba agrees with me ) . im reminded of terrible from unibroue . some other dried fruits come out and a light rum note as it warms .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : in my experience i assumed it would have looked like a hefewizen that i was used to ; being lighter in color . instead , i see a dark amber colored beer that looks like an average ale . thin to no head , small bubble carbonation .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : 2007 vintage , bottle # 263 , and what an awesome bottle it is ; great packaging here . the beer itself has a pitch black body with two fingers of thick brown froth . rings of lace cling to the rim of the glass as the head slowly falls . off to a good start .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : good glowing amber hue . no real head . slightly opaque .	00000000000000
0	appearance : after the demise of the 3 second head , it looked like a cup of coffee in a pint glass .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a translucent pale yellow , with hints of orange . tons of carbonation bubbles are cascading up from the bottom of the glass . the foamy white head is fairly large and reasonably thick , with so-so retention and a bit of weblike lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark brown and is topped by a massive head that took forever to die down . at the end the head was about a finger width .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours pitch black and completely opaque . huge 2-finger foamy mocha head on a fairly aggressive pour . sticks around for a while . has a little lacing . picture perfect looking stout .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a cloudy , fuzzy orange with a big 2 inch evenly sized bubbled head . head retention is good , but no immediate lacing detected .	00000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : its body has a light yellow gold color with great clarity . on top of the body is a small white creamy head . the head fades fast and makes only a very little slick lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy , pale yellow body seriously , i cant even see through it . chill haze or normal color , it doesnt look very appetizing . the head is very nice , though its white , foamy , and very sticky . lots of lacing is what i like to see from a beer like this , and its exactly what im getting .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : very dark brown color , almost black . small tan head quickly dissipated .	0000000000000000
1	appearance : copper ( like the roofs of many a boston building ) .	00000000000000
1	a : i thought the beer was pitch black at first , but holding it to the light i can detect what i think is the faintest hint of red . the head is small and the lacing is light .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : black body with reddish-brown tinges around the edge of the glass ; two fingers of dense brown head that wo n't go away ; tons of glass-coating lace . simply beautiful beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : ca n't be a true maibock , golden tone thin white head disappears in seconds , lacing yeah right .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : well , not really a looker . am extremely thin head formed , but dissipated almost immediately atop this reddish brown brew . yup , that about covers it .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : slightly hazy dark amber color with a head that disappeared so quickly that i could n't even identify it .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dirty , hazy orange color with a pink hue to it . when held up to the light , the edge is a beautiful pink/maroon color . there is minimal off white head ( 1/2 finger ) that quickly disappears . massive amounts of bubbles are present cascading off the bottom of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dingy murky brown . appears to be completely still . some bubbles from a rough pour but not carbonation .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : the bottle was a clear bottle with a piss-yellow beer inside topped off with a dull-olive-grey chilli floating on top . a small layer of oil on top of the ensemble made it look like a cherry from a drink served in hell . i poured it out onto an asahi pilsener glass , wisely ( as i later realised ) leaving the chilli in the bottle . it poured a piss yellow colour with a head that dissipated quickly .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured a black with 2 finger of brown head that faded very quickly . it leaves no lacing or ring of head .	0000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : dirty yellow body with a huge head that lasts quite a while . once the head subsides , there is a decent amount of lacing on the glass . there is also a show being put on by the bubbles due to the markings in the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : single finger head , multiple bubble sizes , very little rising carbonation . transparent gold .	000000000000000000
0	a : black , soily ale drizzles to the glass and excites a nice single finger of mocha head . this head dissipates in a couple minutes , but is easily reintroduced with a quick swish of the stout . scattered sticky lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : strong head , light blond color , no carbonation ( like many bulgarian beers , it all washes into the head )	000000000000000000000000
0	a : a light yellow gold color with a small head that dissolved to a lace .	00000000000000000

1	appearance : very light brown , almost non-existent quickly fading head	00000000000
0	appearance : i poured it with perfect form , yet there was almost no head . what little head there was dissapated within seconds . looks like a pale colored piss . absolutely disgusting and unappealing	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : head dissipates quickly , no lacing . copper color unusually light for the style .	00000000000000000
0	a : lightly hazed dark yellow/light orange color . just a half finger of frothy white head that fell quickly and left no lacing . 4.0	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a caramel brown body with no head to note ; no significant lacing either .	000000000000000000
1	a : wow , this is one of the best looking belgian ales i 've ever seen . almost completely black pour with a huge rocky tan head that leaves a cap for the duration leaving good lacing . it looks almost like a stout .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : awesome looking brew . soft and golden yellow that is completely opaque , big white fluffy head with only a few bubbles in it .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : in the bottle , like a hand grenade , it 's fun . brown bottle cold on a hot day . nice .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : slim head but decent lace , just on the orange side of golden . lace dies quick .	00000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear orangish amber with a thin white head that maybe measures a half finger . poor retention and no lacing .	0000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a very pale yellow , bright beer with large carbonation bubbles and lots of activity . heads pours a thin white bubbly lace , not at all impressive .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : nice blackish brown color with a smaller head that does n't really stick very well .	000000000000000000
1	a : pours pale golden with a really large creamy white head . dissipates quickly into some lacings .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : deep amber in color , low head and poor retention .	0000000000000
0	a : big piece of sludge floating in the head very unappealing . brownish black with a small brown head that dissipates quite fast . decent lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : very foamy stuff this , and quite hard to pour properly . the beer - once poured into a goblet - is cloudy and maple brown topped by a huge off-white head .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : hazy dark yellow , very nice head , carb ok	000000000000
1	a : huge head with mountainous peaks . thick lacing around the glass better head than duvel .	000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a golden yellow-orange in a pilsner glass . very noticible carbonation as the head is over 2 inches fluffy , tight and just slightly off-white . lacing and retention is quite good . red-orange shadows and bright yellow highlights . very few noticible bubbles rise through the clear brew .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : wow . this looks quite a bit different than the guinness i am used to seeing . the liquid is a deep , rich , impenetrable black shade . the head is two inches of thick beige head that has long lasting retention . as it gradually subsides , it coats the sides of the tulip glass with sticky lace .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : an aggressive pour resulted in a body that was somewhere between a bright rich copper and brick orange and a massive white head . the head was dense and sticky and receded slowly to a even cover over the liquid and fed a layered even curtain of lace .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a bright golden-blonde swimming with fine sediment topped with a white head . i think this is one of the most interesting-looking beers i 've ever seen .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : beautiful dark nut brown with a 1 inch head . dense in color and carbonation is hard to see .	0000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours hazy golden with a small , quickly dissipating white head that leaves behind no lace .	0000000000000000000
0	a : pours golden-apricot with straw highlights . small amount of head subsides within seconds , leaving no trace of ever existing . really ugly .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : the pour is magnificent . just what you want from a belgian . a very very large fluffy aromatic head , and good lacing . its a nice darker amber color maybe light brown and a tad hazy as i let some yeast in ...	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear middle-brownish red with a 1-finger head that laces very nicely after 2 minutes . still 1/2 a finger !	0000000000000000000000

0	a : a deep murky dark brown color with no head and no glass lacing .	0000000000000000
1	a : let the cascade effect settle . appear the very dark brown to inscrutable black color with thick creamy tan head naturally for nitro system . the head recede slightly and stand until the last sip and leave fine lacing along its path .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark brown , with a nice , thick off-tan head which looks like its going to fade away fast into nothingness at first , but stays there the whole glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : beautiful clear golden orange with a dark off-white head that disipates and leves nice lacing in a chimay goblet .	0000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a light golden amber . no head at all and no lacing .	000000000000000
0	a : looks kinda like a darker cranberry or rasberry witbier to be honest . mild head with little lacing .	000000000000000000000
0	a : a cloudy brass body with a small cream colored head which falls quickly . a few pillars of carbonation .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : dark as all hell . decent head .	0000000000
0	a : hazy straw pale with a light orange tint . poor head retention . large amounts of carbonation and no lacing .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : unexpectedly light with a thin white head , fading to a thin and fastly disappearing ring .	0000000000000000000
1	a : nice black appearance and when the light reflects through you get a little mahogany hue . nice head at first .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : for a light beer , this looks really watery . very light yellow , resembles ginger-ale . the head was the only redeemable quality , light and fluffy for a few minutes , with wisps of mild lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear gold with a large , pillowy , ivory head . lots of little carbonation bubbles flowing . good lacing .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : i really prefer to drink in the can because poured in a glass seems urine ;	000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours about two fingers of creamy , beige head . a deep , dark brown . dark amber when held up to the light . slow moving , subtle carbonation . a tiny bit of lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a half finger head of slight cream , fair thickness , and poor retention . colour is a semitransparent yellow . sm : light vinegar , earthy notes , pleasant funkiness , bacteria , and heavy yeast . a moderately strong aroma .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a certain cloudiness shows this beer as unfiltered and the bubbles that struggle to the top show that the beer has some body to it .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : urine . with some bubbles .	00000000
0	a : a little uneventful ... a decent golden amber pour , head is a bit lackluster , pretty much no stick , and lacing is minimal .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark ruby red brilliance with a small amount of head . this is one damn good looking beer . let 's hope the carpet matches the drapes !	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pale , golden color . small , white head .	000000000000
0	a : very dark , but lacks the type of head i would expect from an oatmeal stout . the head dissipated almost immediately . disappointing .	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : it pours a clear , but dark colored amber , the shade of rosewood . a thumb 's width of fluffy white head , and lots of lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours an opaque black with half an inch of thick head . great cascading effect from the nitro-tap . always a pleasure to see this . thick lacing down the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : rich golden amber , very little head or lacing . carbonation light as well . solid looking .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : it poured a yellow body with a small white head holding poorly and leaving no lacing .	0000000000000000000
1	appearance : this beer lives up to the first part of it 's name - it 's black as night . the beer sports a fingertip deep layer of a frothy chocolate colored head , floating on the surface of the beer like the milky way against a black night sky . a herd of carbonation bubbles scurry up the sides of the snifter to the surface , creating a small ring of bubbles underneath the layer of head . the beer leaves behind a curtain of light brown lacing along the side of the snifter . pretty . 5	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : very dark brown with lighter edges , no head at all but i 'm going to call that the bartenders fault .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : standard pour yields a .5 finger cream head with poor retention . beer is a dark , blood-red mahogany . lacing is web-like , patterned , and spotty in parts but with very little stick .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : black color with little head . it dissipates quickly .	000000000000
0	a : this brew pours a dark amber looking color . after the pour the small head turns to nothing , with no lacing .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : i love the look of a nitro-beer ... cascading is cool . ok. down to business . pale copper color with a dense cream nitro head , about two inches thick . excellent retention . a few clumps of lacing , but nothing really to speak of . tons of tiny bubbles cling to the inside of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : hazy , unfiltered look . a combination of muddy oranges and lighter amber colors . pours with a light white head . dissipates quickly and leaves little lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours black with a decent brown/red head that dissapates to a thin layer quickly . it looks pretty good through the whole bomber though .	000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a dark black color with a 1 '' milk chocolate colored head .	0000000000000000
0	appearance : red/amber color with a monster head . also noted the very active carbonation seemed to keep some very small ( spices ? ) particles suspended in the brew . also have to note , the entire pack i got were all gushers , quite a surprise from such a prestigious brewery . a solid coat of lace , which looked more like spray paint , dominated the glass . flavor : spices are right up front , nutmeg , pepper , allspice ? i & # 8217 ; m taking wild guesses here . spice fades into a malt sweet that takes about 5 seconds to transition to a hint of hops at the end . balance is good and allows the spice and yeast to come through , but i have to say , this wasn & # 8217 ; t the transcendental experience i had hoped for .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : clear , golden straw with 2 finger white dense head with nice lacing retention	0000000000000000
0	a : hazy , light amber color with two fingers of diminishing off-white foam head . pebble-sized yeast solids are seen slowly settling to the bottom of the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : i must have to say , this beer is gorgeous , crystal clear shimmering copper/amber with golden/orange hues on the edges . creamy off white head ; 1 fingers worth . good head retention all the way down the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours an ultra clear yellow . heavy carbonation , with a large white head . no lacing because the head evaporates in seconds .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours with a decent frothy bubbly head about a finger to start but fades quickly to a light head covering . it has a brilliantly clear toasty maple leaf brown color that gives me vertigo as i stare through it . n : it has a sweet malty aroma to start , with a crisp marzen feel . some toasted malt character and syrupy cracker aroma is there . i also get a slight alcohol and a slight porter style roasted malt smell that finishes off the nose . different but still a decent oktoberfest nose .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a pale straw , transparent yellow colour with a bone white head , instantly dropping to a very thin ring .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear yellow color , perhaps slightly darker than most adjuncts , with a pitiful fizzy white head ( you can literally hear it fizzing like a soda ) that fades before i can even take my first sip . needless to say it did n't leave any lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : great head and nice lacing . smells citrusy and watered down.. not very strong , but nice	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : clear straw color with a large white head that dissipates pretty quickly and leaves no lace .	0000000000000000000
1	a : poured at about 45 degrees into a huge wide mouth belgian glass from iron hill . slow pour down the center of the glass leads to a thin head after two minutes only a thin ring remains . wow this one has really tight bubbles and awesome legs . when held up to light it is a beautiful glowing red . 4.5	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : deep auburn in color , clear , with about 1/2 '' of white soapy head . head dissipates quickly to a very scarce ring of bubbles . no lacing to speak of .	00000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : crystal clear brassy body with a good 3/4 '' head that kicks around for a few minutes before departing in a thin layer of brussells lace .	00000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : yellow to clear . not much to look at . some white head and lacing .	000000000000000000
1	appearance : very clear with amber colored tones . the head was a perfect big fluffy two fingers that slowly receded to a nice foamy covering . the foam produced some of the best lacing i 've seen . i was shocked that a beer that looked this good could come from a can . i have totally changed my opinion of beer from a can .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : i was not at all impressed with the pale straw color , but the head was one of the most substantial and beautiful i 've seen . gorgeous lacing left on the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : the brew pours a light mahogany color with mauve hues . a soft pour resulted in a bubbly two finger pinkish-white head that recedes quickly leaving very little lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a hazy , pale orange color . has small , fizzy head that dissipates quickly and leaves only spotty lacing .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours super viscous . no head or lacing . beer is a deep , dark , opaque , motor-oil black . leaves nice oily remnants on the side of the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : very clear , honestly , it truly is just slightly colored water ( piss actually ) . decent initial head , but dissipates quickly , no lace .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this poured an opaque pitch black with some thick dark tan head . very dark .	000000000000000000

1	a : pours a very dark brown , with a full tan head , medium retention , looks like a good porter should in a pint glass .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a very light crystal clear yellow like any other adjunct , with a pithy white head that fades to nothing and leaves no lacing at all .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : thick foamy head , but not much , deep deep dark brown . i want to climb inside of this beer and drink my way out , from the look ( and the name ) .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a medium to dark brown with almost no head . a small island of foam floats in the middle of my glass with a thin ring around the edge . kind of looks like coca cola that has been left in cup for too long . after a second pour , even the carbonation looks like that of a soda , thin bubbles and extremely short lasting .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : the same pale , straw color as bud light , i can not tell these two beers apart based on their color , but the regular bud had a little more head and it actually retained it for a minute or so . it is a good looking beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : could n't get much of a head no matter how hard i tried in my freshly washed glass . orange amber color . incredibly horrible retention of the head that i did get and minimal lacing . fine particles floating throughout .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : gold to copper . nice and clear , a job well done . nice head befitting of lager , leaves half a finger until the last drop .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : normal beer yellow , no head at all	0000000000
0	a : when i opened the bottle ( 33 cl . ) with first the bottle-opener and the cork-screw it poured golden ( with some orange ) . the head was surprisingly small , white and compact - but small . the beer was also cloudy , with some residual lacings .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : deep reddish , full color , with a thick , almost picture perfect creamy off-white head , great lacing on the glass . bubbly at first but that settled quickly .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : bright copper , 3-finger cloudy head sticks around , impressive lacing	0000000000000
1	appearance : wonderfully dark with a slight cream colored head . appears golden ruby around the edges of the glass when held up to the light . ca n't get much better than a properly poured guinness ! perfect lacing down the whole glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : looks like a plain lager , complete with rapidly-fading head . nice bit of lacing , though .	00000000000000000000
1	a : black with light tan head . there is carbonation , which is a big deal coming from la .	000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours a transparent golden orange color with a two inch ivory head . lots and lots of spongy lace that sticks to the sides of the glass . head retention is incredible .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours with a wonderful golden color and a massive , briliant-white head . the head is very rocky and produces magnificent lace . plus , there is a giant stream of bubbles . all-in-all , a picture perfect beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : nice cloudy golden color with a robust head on it . there was almost too much sediment which quickly settled at the bottom .	00000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dark amber body with a large dirty-white head on the pour , this sadly all too quickly disappeared and finished up as a small blob of froth floating like an island on top of a lifeless brown pond . smattered lacing is few and far between , with some weak looking patches here and there .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : deep golden , turning to medium brown body . little to no head , though its more carbonation than i expected for the age of this bottle . doesnt look likemuch but i didnt buy it to look at it .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pale golden yellow with a thin weak white lace , if it was not for the quick champagne like carbonation forcing bubble to the top there would be no head at all . yeast is quite compact and stayed on the bottom while pouring to leave a nearly clear beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured a nice straw yellow color with light carbonation and a nice white little cap	00000000000000000

1	appearance : a crisp , clear , golden yellow pour . this stuff wont stop foaming ! ! wow .	00000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a midnight ( ha , ha ) brown with a fluffy , two-finger dark tan head that moves around quite a bit and has large bubbles -- and enough movement to seem , well , alive , at least at first . lets of fine , tiny bubbles move to the top of the glass , but calms down into a fluffy , espresso , cherry tinged head . the head retention is amazing -- it 's been sitting here for at least ten minutes and the head still rises to the top of the snifter . in fact , the lowest level the head ever gets to is about half a finger , and there 's quite a bit of fluffy sticky lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : nice golden color , but a bit hazy . moderate head and retention .	0000000000000000
1	a : beautiful maize pours with a fluffy white head and sparse lacing . a lot of sediment floating around amongst the bubbles on of the more active and beautiful beers	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured a orange amber with a 1.5 finger head which dissipated quickly but a nice lace hung around . the beer was quite cloudy due to some yeast coming out during the pour into a piraat tulip glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : black body with a nie silky tan head , sith fair retention , reduces to a lacing ring aroud the glass	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : we 're off to a good start . an aggressive pour yielded an impressive 1 1/2 fingers of creamy mocha colored head . the beer itself was jet black with minimal garnet hued edges when held to the light .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dull , cloudy yellow with a short white head . the foam does not linger long .	000000000000000000000
0	appearance : you 'd think this beer was once a little more reddish than it is , now it 's sort of an off-brown murky color . for a high octane beer , the head was pretty solid .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : its a light gold color and with sediment	0000000000
1	a : a relatively aggressive pour resulted in a finger thick tan head that had decent retention before finally becoming just a slight covering of bubbles after quite a few minutes . there was decent lacing . the beer is opaque and only shows the slightest tint of red when held up to the light .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : it would be a stretch to call it a `` light straw color '' . most likely it was the dirty glass that tinted it to the shade of urine normally reserved for those rare moments when you know you 've had too much to drink 'cause your pissing nearly clear .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a blood-vomit color , to steal a phrase . murky light rose color with a short-lived off-white head . it looks like a lambic , but knowing what is to come , i ca n't give it a lambic pass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : rusty reddish body , minimal head barely covers the surface then dissipates .	000000000000000
0	a : orange and hazy with a small white head ( bad pour by the bartender ) either way the head had very little retention and no lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : two finger pathetic , thin abysmal head , devoid of cream and of laughable fourteen second retention . clear dark yellow off-urine colour . this is looking like a cooking beer already . sm : a bit like creamed urine . i try not to laugh in front my german friend , but she joins in when she sees what i 'm drinking .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a cloudy light amber color with a prodigious head that few but fantme can produce ; sheets of lacing all over the place	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark brown/black with three-finger , tan , rocky head that lasted several minutes . good lacing .	0000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dark reddish brown color . a small white cap of foam forms , and leaves hardly any lace .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear ruddy/pink hued copper body that momentarily develops a finger of off-white head . there is a small collar after collapse , with no lacing . swirling pulls many bubbles out of suspension and produces a pretty decent ( but again , short-lived ) head . quite nice for the style .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : extremely deep mahogany color with nice lacy head	0000000000
0	appearance : hazy deep honey color . 1/2 '' creamy head that did n't last long . lots of tiny rising bubbles and pretty lacing	0000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a transparent copper orange color with tons of carbonation . the head is off white and tops 2.5 '' with lots of great retention . tons and tons of coating , spongy lace cling to the glass . a real beauty of an ipa . a ramp of foam stays on the surface of the beer and then attaches itself to the side of the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a burnt ruby red with 1 finger of white head that dissipates quickly . excellent clarity and moderate carbonation . there 's a fluffy layer of webbed lacing . n : apple cinnamon , huge clean caramel malts , banana , booze , hints of clove and perhaps some coriander .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : light to dark brown . a small fizzy head . lightly laced .	000000000000000
1	a : pours a deep dark shade of brown , *nearly* completely black , with a thick frothy 2+ finger light brown head that sits nicely on top . it leaves great lacing on my glass as i work through the bottle . 5.0 .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : amber ; minimal head , no retention or lace .	000000000000
1	appearance : golden brownish with a two-finger creamy head . no transparency ; totally cloudy . one of the finest-looking beers i 've ever set eyes to .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : orange/copper with a little haziness . nice looking white head does not stick around long . thin lace does .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : dark black , no head .	00000000
1	a : i like it . bronzed , translucent amber with a rolling `` tight 'n ' tiny '' bubbles foamy head that dwindles to the likes of algae .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dark brown brew with a frothy tan head that dissipates quickly .	00000000000000
0	a : pours a light brown , some light passage , minimal head , no lacing	0000000000000000
1	a : a clear , bright reddish amber with vivacious carbonation . head is vigilant and leaves a nice lacing behind . as good as you are gon na get looks-wise .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : light brown pour with lots of foam coming out of the bottle . makes an impossibly huge , thinner looking , fluffy , off-white head that sticks around forever . could only pour half the bottle into my snifter , as the head was so insane . color is a murky brown with very little carbonation evident . head slowly fades unevenly and bumpy , leaving some thin , chunky lacing down the glass . a thick film lingers and lots of chunky , gobs of foam . this does n't look like a stout . maybe an out of control strong dark ale .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours dark brown , near black , with minimal head that quickly reduces to an uneven ring of bubbles . light lacing .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : bottle poured into duralex tumbler . slightly cloudy reddish amber . 1/4 '' head dissipates quickly .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : very dull amber brown color . the clarity is poor with a lot of haze . a small white tan head barely forms and fades very quickly .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured into a duvel sniffter ; beautiful dark blackish red with just a trace of light sneaking through . the head is a glorious eggshell white so dense it looks like the matting on on a picture . excellent retention with full lacing as its enjoyed .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a hazy yellow color with huge foamy white head . slight lacing down the glass	000000000000000000
0	appearance : this looked dissapointing . there was a very small head when served and it left almost no lace at all . i 'll give the brewer the benifit of the doubt on the head as it was poured almost to the top of the pint glass so there was n't much room for a head . the color was a darker brownish amber . it was very clear .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : the most disgusting beer i 've ever set eyes upon ... immediately off the pour , the body was a light , sunny yellow , but as the head stabilized , a thick column of sediment that reminded me of whale sperm in an ocean began to very slowly lurch down toward the bottom of the glass ... and , i was using a weizen glass , so it was truly horrifying to behold . many large chunks settled to the bottom , and some lighter chunks stayed suspended in the body , which eventually settled on a rich tequila sunrise orange . head was of the persistent , off white , three finger variety .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy pale yellow with a small white head that fades quickly . color is a little dim .	00000000000000000000
1	a : pours golden , clear , with a thick fluffy white head that thins out considerably , but leaves a nice ring lace behind . carbonation is visible ; this beer looks great .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : wow . pitch black . thick head that threatens to escape my snifter that holds a 22 with ease . thick light brown rocky head that lasts and lasts .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a translucent brown color , slight head , and lacing . looks a little wattery/thin for a porter	000000000000000000000
0	appearance : extremely cloudy orangish-yellow with tiny bits of stuff floating around . it needs to be poured slowly because of the crazy foaming white head . the head dissipates fairly rapidly , with decent lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : looked like upchuck with tons of particles floating in the glass . it grosses me out to look at it . i 'd probably have rather taken this right out of the neat bottle in which it came . points given back for a beautiful foam that seemed to want to launch right out of the bottle .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pale gold ... . pretty thick on the bubbles . not very impressed at all	00000000000000000
0	appearance : first off , this beer 's got some pretty cool artwork featuring an old train on the bottle ( not to mention , the name is pretty cool ... ) . a somewhat dark , murky , orange liquid poured into the glass . has a beige-colored head that does n't last too long . however , with the relatively high alcohol percentage , i ca n't really fault the beer too much for having a quickly decaying head . carbonation seems weak ; tiny bubbles , and very few of them at that ; maybe more of it would have improved head retention a bit . this one just looked so ... dead . ca n't say i 'm all that impressed so far .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a clear golden amber with a small head made up of big bubbles which turn into a thin silky cap .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : very pale straw yellow . typical adjunct lager look but it did yield quite a nice head . follows the style just a little too closely to the big boys .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pale gold ; quick dissipating head .	000000000
1	appearance : pours with just over 2 fingers of off white head . this settles slowly to a still substantial cap pf foam , leaving behind thick , complete lacing coverage . the beer itself is a light copper with a the slightest of haze and moderate activity . absolutely beautiful .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours brown with a small head that fades quickly , no lacing . there are very large chunks floating throughout .	00000000000000000000000
0	appearance : rich dark gold beer , pours clear at first , but towards the bottom of the bottle there is a lot of sediment in suspension . this is an unfiltered beer so i guess that 's to be expected , but damn . on the upside , this beer produces a creamy , fluffy stark white head with good retention .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : clear orange in color with some golden highlights . one inch head lasts a while and some thick lace paints the glass .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : pitch black . almost non-existant lace .	000000000
0	a : super hazy ruby-orange . visible carbonation . off-white head starts promising but dips down to more of a rim . a fair amount of sediment dumped into the glass as well . i understand it is a bottle-conditioned beer , but this seems a bit excessive .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : the pour into my snifter creates an off white 1 '' head composed of big bubbles . the beer is a dark burnished copper color .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : great appearance of a deep amber/red as anticipated and expected of an amber ale .	00000000000000000
1	a : sticky , two-finger , foamy white head . clear , yellow - light amber pour . lace sticks to the glass beautifully .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : pale yellow -- like lemonade ! cloudy , which i expect from a wheat ale . the head was short-lived , and no lacing .	000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : hazy golden yellow with a small white head .	00000000000
0	appearance : pours a very light yellow color with a short 1/4 '' white head that breaks apart immediately . no lime in the pint glass .	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a tar black with a substantial small-bubbled tan head . head slowly fades leaving a bit of lacing .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : standard pour yields a .5 finger semi-coarse head with great retention . beer is a clear orange-peach . lacing is stringy with great stick . great on all fronts .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a cloudy dark brown , nearly black color . a fairly aggressive pour gave a maximum head of about 1/4 a finger , which quickly receded . i 'm sure the abv did n't help with the head formation , but i 've seen other kuhnhenn brews form very nice heads despite super high abvs . 5.0	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : well , it 's certainly a dark beer . very thin amount of head with the pour . pretty average looking for a imperial stout	000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : i poured some out just so i could see what it looked like . into the plastic cup it went . very , very pale yellow . some carbonation , but virtually no head . about what i expected .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dark orange hue , almost no head , moderate lacing , carbonation briefly collected on the glass and disappeared shortly after i began to drink .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : for a macro , the head looks pretty okay . still evaporates fast as hell . looks like apple juice .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : dark mahogany . the color reminds me of a well worn in dark red cigar chair . a 3 finger head that is a mixture of large and small bubbles and is light tan in color . the head settles quickly to a lacing that continues to lace as this beer disappears from my glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a deep black with no visible light . 1 1/2 fingers of mocha colored head , tight , with good retention . good lacing throughout .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark brown and quite red on the edges ( even towards the middle ) ; pretty clear even on the brown sections . smaller off white bubbly head that dissipates quickly . very little lace . not a great porter look . 2/5	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : beautiful . golden . very thick lacing in my plastic cup .	00000000000000
0	a : pours a deep honey color with a small white head that quickly vanished into nothing . after a couple minutes there where zero bubbles to speak of and it looked like a glass of juice . no lace .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this is undoubtedly a perfect looking beer . pours a gold/orange color with a little bit of haze . white , thick , tasty head that lasts for most of the beer . great looking lacing . this beer is at the peak of apas appearancewise .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a hazy mahogany brown color . a two finger beige head forms that leaves rings of patchy lace .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : clear burnt orange . quickly dissipating head leaving a nice 1cm froth .	000000000000000
1	a : beautiful mahogany color . clear . looks varnished . three fingers on sticky , light tan head with decent retention and a good amount of lacing . a picture perfect beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pale gold ( exactly like champagne ) , frothy white foam that dissipates to a thin layer of spittle , lots of rising bubbles	00000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this sample has a magnificent candy-apple red color . in addition , it produces an interesting pink head with loads of lacing . this brew has a striking appearance .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a thick very dark brown with a nicely laced brown head . looks exceptional .	00000000000000000
1	appearance : the pour is black with chestnut highlights . a thin light brown head does n't quite cover the body and soon fades away completely .	000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : one beautiful beer , with a clear pale golden color and a fluffy white head that lasts forever and leaves lacing all over the place	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a golden-amber pour , though the head was a little insignificant . about a finger tall , and a bit quick to recede to a thin sheet .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours from a bottle into a pint glass with a deep caramel color , but looking through the glass , this beer settles into a dark , slightly reddish color , almost like a cola . a head is present , but it is a mild tan , unremarkable , and full of larger bubbles as if you poured a budwiser , foamy not frothy .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a pretty bad look to its . yes , its black , as it should be , but no head at all , just a few brown bubbles ...	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a clear red-brown body capped by a little less than two fingers of densely-packed cream-colored head that features terrific retention and lacing .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : bready , fluffy head . great golden color with very vague amber hues . decent lacing .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : looks like a strawberry amber color . it has a medium sized head that dissipates quickly .	0000000000000000000
1	a : a nice deep ruby red / dark mahogany . a tan head that disappears quickly .	000000000000000000
0	a : no head whatsoever , and my glass is clean . pours an opaque dark orange/brown color . honestly , not very appetizing .	0000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : by far , the best thing about this beer . large off-white head that lasted until the last drop . pours a nice dark golden amber color .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear medium amber body under a frothy pillowy ecru head that just wo n't go away , leaving thick , comprehensive lace . stunning .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : no doubt , the lack of any head on top of this brew is hindering the strength of the aroma , but what 's there is respectable . initially , a boatload of caramel sweetness hits me upside the head along with a toasted biscuity malt . as for the hops , the pine-scented variety is the most dominant , followed by citrus in a distant second . i also get some toffee and the slightest hint of chocolate in there , too .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a hazy straw yellow with huge bubbly white head ; good head retention with spotty lacing .	00000000000000000000
0	a : pours dark , almost like a stout . head is disappointing at best . one finger lasted for about 30 seconds , giving way to a next-to-nothing lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a nice dark orange transparent orange body with a just off white huge head . the head had great retention and large bubbles and had good lacing all over the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this one is a clear dark copper color with orange and yellow highlights . it pours with a nice two finger white head that has decent retention .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : jet black and opaque ; nice brown head with tight bubbles	0000000000000
1	appearance : pours a hazy chestnut color with a nice , rocky head that sheets lacing all over the chalice	00000000000000000000
1	a : dark red with a creamy fluffy head that stayed the course . the cloud of foam was like one of those simpsons marshmallow clouds .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a rather pallid gold with a very light head , looks like a macro lager .	0000000000000000000

0	appearance : ultra pale yellow with a small head	000000000
1	a : clear amber color , huge foaming head that slowly settles to 2 fingers thickness , lots of lacing	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : amber , clear carbonated , medium head	000000000
0	appearance : admittedly did not pour out to be able to determine	000000000000
0	a : pours a hazy dark cherry colour with little to no head . lots of bubbles floating to the top .	0000000000000000000000
0	appearance : the beer has a very clear pale yellow coloration . any less yellow and this would be clear water . the head was about one finger high with no retention .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear golden copper with a finger of white head that fades into a thin ring with a little lacing	00000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a cloudy dark orange , very light head , no lace , poor appearance for a wheat beer .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours an opaque black body with a tiny , tiny beige head that , regardless of being so tiny , was rather short-lived .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : a vigorous pour from on high results in a midnight-black body supporting two and a half inches of dense brown foam . impressive retention and thick sheets of lacing . spot on for the style , there 's really nothing to mark off for here . awesome looking brew .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : very clear pale straw in color with a white head .	0000000000000
1	appearance : 5 |	0000
0	a : this is one black stout ! this is blacker than satan 's armpit . slight carbonation ( i was worried by the previous talk of flatness ) but it was there . not much head to speak of , just a slight brown ring .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours very very light yellow , good finger and a 1/2 of white head that settles to nothing ... no lacing at all ... looks very flat , no carbonation at all .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : medium golden amber . very nice head formation and retention . looks beautiful in the glass .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : a dark orange with what appear to be floaties suspended in the beer . a nice white one finger head that settles after a good length of time and leaves nice spiderweb sticky lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a fire-y plum flesh amber , nearly opaque . 1 1/2 fingers of off white creamy heads forms and holds forever . lots of lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : crystal-clear with thin white head that recedes quickly .	00000000000
0	a : the pour is clear and very pale yellow with very little head . they serve it with a lemon wedge . i declined to make use of it .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : thin head , quarter or half a finger at most . very fizzy , raised a head then it dissipated very quickly . color is a deep gold , slightly hazy .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours an amber in color that has a nice amount of copper hues to it . held to the light , more of that copper and some reds come out . the body is pretty clear , for some reason i was expecting a little more haze or darkness to the body . a light carbonation is moving around in the body . the pour yielded about half a finger of off white , cream colored head . it does n't stick around too long and falls to a thin top cap that leaves minute amounts of spotty lacing . meh .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this has to be the pretties beer of all time ... .pitch black beer with a fingers worth of off white creamy head . the beautiful cascade as it 's being poured is wonderful to watch ... the head settles to a 1/2 a finger layer and stays there ... lacing , hell the foam sticks to the sides of the glass all the way down .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : muddy-brown , hint of tan head , touch of lace .	0000000000000
1	a : a pale copper color with a dirty , off-white , one-finger head . lots of lace as the head drops .	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a deep golden amber with little or know head , however , there was some lacing which was a pleasant surprise	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : extraordinary appearance with a cloudy tea brown body and a rocky beige head ; great retention and lacing	00000000000000000000
1	a : the pour is pretty dark and dense for a porter , in my opinion ( maybe i just have n't had that many primos ) . the single-finger head dies down relatively quickly , leaving a nice , thin vanilla top-coating , which rests upon the chocolate bottom like a somewhat flat guinness . some subtle lacing that sticks well to the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : the pour creates a 1 '' white head that never really falls back into the beer . some moderate lacing is left behind . the beer is a rich golden color .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : 1 1/2 fingers of that creamy , grey beige head forms more quickly than other nitro dry irish stouts i 've had . the body is dark brown with red and orange edges . good retention and lacing . and this beer actually fills up my whole pint glass !	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : golden color with a thick head	00000000
1	a : the beer is a cloudy orange-brown color with a big foamy off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass . the pour also creates a nice guiness-like cascade of carbonation , which i havent seen too often in this style .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : to be expected	00000
1	appearance : does n't pour pale really but more of a copper color with a generous 3 finger off-white head that sticks around for awhile and leaves some lacing . looks more like an ipa that an apa .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : nothing special . pale yellow color with white , quickly disappearing head . if you drink it straight out of the bottle though , it does n't matter .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a lovely crystal clear honey gold with three fingers of dense white head . the head retains well all the way down the glass , accompanied by a constant torrent of bubbles and leaving a good lacing . beautiful .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours red , with a thick , slowly leaving off-white head that leaves behind lots of lace .	00000000000000000000

1	a : looks just like the picture , pours very nice , lacing is good and is retained throughout the drink . beautiful color , very impressed , like looking at it a lot .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : the head is ridiculous and a bit obnoxious here . several pours to get it out and got annoying to wait for it . hazy orange with loads of sediment , not the most attractive color either . obviously , there was serious lacing . n : far more sweetness than i was thinking i would get , didnt really catch the abundance of ibus it is listed as having .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : i struggle to pull the plug on this one . it reminds me of decorking a wine bottle ; i say this because it has so little carbonation evident on the corking , that there ca n't be any carb . so i pour it , and here we are : flat as kansas . dark brown . no lacing . hazy even at the edges .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : pours a dark orange color with a wispy head that disappears in seconds .	0000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark , translucent , brown with lots of rising carbonation bubbles . it has a 1 1/2 finger , off-white head with good retention and leaves a decent lace . if only the rest of the beer could live up to its somewhat promising appearance ...	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : deep amber/mahogany , minimal head . nice lacing and plenty of carbonation bubbles oozing from her .	0000000000000000000
0	a : murky orangish color . not really any head going on and thus no lacing . 4.0	000000000000000000
1	a : pours a very dark brown , almost black with a massive 2.5 finger tan/brown colored head . this slowly dissipated to about one finger of foam that lasted for the rest of the time drinking . lacing covers the entire glass . picture perfect .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the beer is a deep black color , with a short dense beige head that fades very slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : i 'm glad that the bar-tender gave me this caveat : do n't let its appearance fool you . it looked disturbing like a light beer , with a whole lot of hazified yeast action going on .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours black with ruby highlights , no real head to speak of . even with a hard pour .	000000000000000000000
0	a : looked exactly like tomato soup ... honestly it looked better after i threw it into the intracoastal ... even then , in brown ocean water mind you , it left a red trail	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very thing looking , clear and bubbly . pale orange in color with very fast dissipating head .	00000000000000000000
0	a : very hazy , medium golden color with over one finger of diminishing white foam head . no lacing remains on the glass . specks of rusty brown sediment are visible at the bottom of the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a surprisingly dark amber/mahogany color with about a finger and a half of white head , which recedes into a thin cap with a little lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : poured with a wonderfully massive , foamy three-finger head . as a drink it , i 'm notcing some nice cling ... which is pleasant to the eye and almost mandatory for an ipa . the beer is a burnt orange/copper . looking closer , you may notice that this is a damn murkey beer . i 'm gon na say this is bottle conditioned .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the usual color of a porter ...	000000000

0	a : brown , somewhat lifeless with a short lived head .	000000000000
0	a : black with little head production . there was a substantial amount of rust around cap ( probably from the tin wrapper on the top ) . no lace . near mirror surface .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy beige to orange color with huge , bubbled and persistent white head which does n't desappears . many lacings left ( reminds the duvel 's famous foam )	0000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pretty basic golden yellow . no head . no real lacing . meh .	0000000000000000
0	a : zero head , zero implication of a head , no carbonation at all , even when held to light . beer was poured to the lip of the brim . looks like blackberry juice . this is not beer . from appearance alone , something is obviously off about the tap setup , why did they serve this to me ?	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : nice yellowish orange color . super hazy . you can see the yeast swimming around , looks almost like glitter . big fluffy , like a cloud , 3 finger head . perfect white , with a couple light tan spots where the yeast came out of the bottom of the bottle . great lacing and the head might never go away .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : possibly the clearest ipa i have seen ! absolutely see-through amber , possibly from the 90 minute boil or just the knockdown times in the fermenter that really give this beer a sexy look . good head , mild lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours an entirely clear golden amber ; mountainous , foamy white head tops off the glass , with a constant stream of bubbles flowing up through the beer for the entirety of its time spent with me . very impressive to look at , and one of the most visually appealing beers i 've seen .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : light golden-yellow color , with a huge , billowy head , with excellent retention and lacing . actively visible carbonation gives it something of a nice animation .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours with a 1 finger high , creamy light-brown head that becomes fizzy and diminishes fairly quickly . the film that is left disappears eventually but the bubbles continue to actively float through the glass . the body is 95 % clear and a cross between amber and orange in color . no lacing . very illuminating , capturing the light from my lamp and becoming , sort of , it 's own new light source .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

( very cool ! ) after it settles it forms a thick , supper creamy , tan head . its head is stiff , has great retention time and leaves light tan rings of lace on the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : the appearance of this beer is great ... a rich golden amber , topped with a head that carries over some of those golden hues . the head forms into a tulip pretty much picture-perfect , at least from the pour i got from the bottle . it holds on for a while , never completely disappearing , all the while leaving behind some nice sticky lace patterns all over the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

'05 . the beer is black , no other way to say it . i held it to the light , nothing really gets through . there is also a nice thick light brown head , about 1 1/2 inches that fell to , well , a nice 1/4 inch thick light brown head as the beer was consumed . good thick lacing to the end .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a very dark mahogany brown with a great 2 finger chocolate milk colored thick frothy head . the carbonation looks great , and the head retention is awesome as its very slow to fade . lacing is great too , forming amazing patterns on the glass and not leaving .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a clear straw yellow , with a laughably pathetic thin disgusting head that goes from two fingers to one in ten seconds and completely disappears to nothing in twenty five seconds . at least i do n't have to taste that part of the beer . sm : smells of straw with maybe a bit of horse urine for flavouring ( that extra touch from the brewmaster - eau de cheval , anyone ? )	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : this beer was poured from the 11.2oz bottle into a standard pint glass , in direct violation of the instructions on the label . the body is remarkably opaque but not terribly dark . the structure of the head is unique . it 's super yeast and looks like the foam that forms on the top of baguette batter . this is obviously a gift from the beer gods .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours a clear copper with a thick , creamy , off-white head that 's fed by a massive quantity of bubbles . retention is excellent , the head slowly fades to a persistent quarter-inch layer leaving lace that clings to the glass in thick patches . i ca n't think of a single thing wrong with the way this beer looks .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a clear straw body beneath half a finger of coarse , quickly-dissipating foam that leaves an oil-slickish island of tiny bubbles . minimal lace . boring , ugly fizzy yellow beer . ugh .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : golden clear white quickly dissipating head leaves no lacing left on the glass .	0000000000000000

0	a : a cloudy amber colored beer with a white head , practically no retention , the head disappeared just as fast as it showed up , just a few clumps of bubbles linger . a few spots of lacing as well . some more head retention would be nice .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : dark brown with a slight hue of burgandy . poured to an inch of off-white luscious foamy head , with fabulous lacing that sticks to the side of glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : sludge-tastic brown with plenty of chunks . if it did n't have that thick greyish head , it would have passed off as raw sewage . serves me right for procrastinating and ending up with the tail end of the bottle .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark amber , with a thinner head than expected . didnt really look like a triple .	0000000000000000000

0	a : no head . colour is a clear light gold . i 'm unimpressed . sm : pear , citrus ester hops , distinct ammonia ( i shit you not ) , and maybe cream . the aroma is just downright repugnant , but fortunately is only moderate in strength .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a murky orange/copper color with a two-finger off-white rocky head . nice lacing as the head slowly fades . ( there seems to be an unfiltered trend in russia right now , so i do n't know if the murkiness has anything to do with that , or not . )	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a moderately hard pour yielded one finger of bubbly white head that dissipated to a thin layer of about a centimeter of suds , leaving a bit of lace in its wake . the beer itself was a slightly hazy golden orange color .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a beautiful golden , copper in color with a plethora of thick , creamy white head that lasts . tons of lacing . carbonation levels are solid . exactly what you want to see from an ipa . all signs point to plenty of hops with a bit of balance from a malt backbone .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : it looks more like a lager than a witiber ... in fact , it looks more like a light lager . it has a once inch head . moderate lacing . the body is a slightly hazy straw color .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : only poured it out once because let 's face it , this is definitely meant to be consumed by the can . when i did pour it out it was a very pale yellow color . light passes through very easily and reveals a clean , bubbly , hay colored brew . a rocky head dissipated within seconds and fizzes into almost nothing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : poured with some carbonation and head , but eventually died down into a dark and still liquid . one of those beers that exhibits no lacing , but is still able to stain the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : best by date printed as 6/25/13 . pours dark and thick into a snifter ; 1 finger of head forms on top and stays there forever , like vanilla icing on a dark chocolate torte .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : unbelievable white head with easily the best retention of any beer -- i think it is actually growing bigger after pouring and sitting for a few minutes . the head 's consistency is like frosting made of bubbles . the clear golden hue after careful decanting accentuates the active carbonation .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a piss yellow with small but steady carbonation streams and a inch white head with solid retention and lacing that is above average for the style . i hate the color so it gets a two . ( i 'm being harsh )	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : dark black colour . brilliant creamy , tan , thick head with amazing retention . this is a proper head . sm : coffee , oats , toffee , chocolate , cocoa , alcohol .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : natty light is an amazing beverage in that it 's physical appearance is almost identical to water . some bubbles and a slight yellowish tint are the only indications as to its true form .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : 1 '' foamy white head that fell to a collar with thin lacing everywhere . slightly hazed reddish-copper body .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : not a very pretty beer to look at . quite turbid , brown in color , with almost no head .	00000000000000000000000
0	appearance : clear golden yellow . at first a lage white head had formed , but quickly dissappeared . it is very effervescent , tons of little bubbles just streaming through the beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy golden color , the initial pour produces a fizzy off-white head that quickly dies into ... nothing , non-existent cap and pathetic lacing .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : really ? we 're calling this a porter ? it looks more like a drab brown ale . a decent pour yields a loose two finger head . with minor , unspectacular lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pale yellow golden colour with a great clarity , the head lacks a bit and is only a thin ring of white lace .	00000000000000000000000000

1	a : hazy golden color with a thick long lasting and sticky white head	00000000000000

1	a : poured from the can into a pint glass . body is a golden honey color with a bright , creamy white head . the cascading-nitro thing looks good , and the head lingers for a long time .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : in the bottle and then the glass this looked like a promising brew . tasty-looking clumpy yeast , a good pale ale colour , and a white head which looked slightly too puffy for the style .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : cloudy straw color with large frothy and dense white head with great lacing and retetion .	000000000000000000

1	appearance : crystal clear and bubbly pale golden-amber body . pours a rather large and bubbly white head that quickly melts into a solid finger , leaving good lacing all the way down .	0000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : poured a creamy one fingered head . the color is of a mahogany like state , but sadly this appears thin giving me thought of not much flavors . this laces quite randomly , but i love it .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : rich , dark brown , with a creamy-looking two-finger head that lingers .	000000000000000
0	a : golden yellow pour , perfectly clear . a fizzle of white head that 's gone in seconds , leaving a sleepy-looking liquid with a random scattering of lonely carbonation bubbles . no lace .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours , um , canola oil yellow ? no real indication of carbonation beyond the initial and transient finger of white foam .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : hazy , straw yellow with good head retention and thick bonewhite foam .	000000000000000

0	a : watered down urine , with two finger head which almost immediately starts to disappear into nothing with no lacing .	0000000000000000000000
0	appearance : looks pink coming out of the bottle but amber in the glass . fast fading head knocks off a point .	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : the beer has a brown reddish hue . the head is thick about 2.5 inches tall . nice foamy and with an off biege coloration . great head retention . rings of foam line my glass marking its passage .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : fizzy yellow body under a nearly non-existent white head . no lace , no retention .	000000000000000000

0	a : hazy straw/gold color with some carbonation up the glass . head is half a finger and recedes quickly , leaving no ring and no lacing . pretty unimpressive for a belgian , imo .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : creamy , buttery light beige with a golden hue . very pure white lacy head .	000000000000000000
1	appearance : using my trusty spiegelau tulip , this brew pours a jet black with about a half finger of mocha colored head that dissipates quickly leaving a light ring around the edge of the glass . the lacing down the sides of the glass is magnificent , and when you consider the way this beer appeared to seep slowly out of the bottle and the total opaqueness in the glass ; well , it just adds to the illusion of this beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a crystal-clear golden-amber body with two fingers of off-white head . the head recedes slowly and leaves decent lacing . there 's just something about the tone of amber that 's very satisfying .	000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : i think miller lite may have a better head than this . absolutely falls to nill immediately , along with absolutely no lacing . hardly any bubbles in the dull yellow color of the glass . how is this possible ?	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : golden , almost orange beer , with a touch of red ; almost the color of apple juice ; very clear and clean , as if looking at the world through orange-tinted glasses ; light carbonation , with bubbles floating to the top periodically ; head pours a white , frothy , .5 finger thickness that quickly dissipates ; soapy lacing minimal , but there	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : green bottle with a picture of a moose on the label . i poured the beer into a 16 oz . mug , and the moose mysteriously vanished . what a trip !	00000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : caramel brown in color with a quickly dissipating off white head that leaves very little lacing behind .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured ontap into a chalice . pours a ruby reddish in color , a bit cloudy and a short livid white head . this does n't appear to be to style , as the beer is not a rich gold in color by any stretch .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured a light straw yellow . very pale . two fingers of white , billowy foam developed and dissipated quickly to leave a ring around the outside edge .	0000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : pale golden colour , with a few big bubbles for a head , which are gone pretty soon , and completely flat . some sediment lurking around but it is bottle conditioned so that is to be expected .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a cloudy golden yellow with a huge 5 '' ivory head . it shows excellent retention . rings of lace remain after every swig is taken .	000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours black with two fingers of dark tan head that fades into a thin cap with a solid sheet of lacing . the nitro tap definitely helps .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : very dark ... could be 'black ' but for a smoldering mahogany-red swath . fizzy head grows to a half-finger , but withdraws quickly . star-shaped film , but really no lace to speak of , outside a few pinpoints that glide down the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : little head ; very clear , dark golden amber ; not much carbonation	000000000000000
1	appearance : as black as night , with touches of brown when put to the light . thankfully , not the blue/green that the witch on the bottle might fool your eyes into thinking . two solid fingers of head that left nearly a wall of lace on one end of the glass and stayed around a good long time .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a most pale straw hue , just slightly hazy ; fast growing , huge and tightly silky white froth ( exactly like a perfectly aerated capuccino head ) sustains brilliantly , supported by a lively carbonated body underneath .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark amber ; no head , no threads , no lacing -- you might think it dead !	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a very solidly opaque orangeish color . almost bordering on brownish in parts . and it 's beyond being just cloudy . honestly not the most appetizing hue . thankfully the head is a pretty nice , thick white foam .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : an inch or more of silky , tight head that is not going away . seems pretty dark but the light is low . thick head and sheety lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : opaque dark brown color . plenty of frothy head that wo n't quit and leaves lots of lacing . 4.0	0000000000000000000000

0	appearance : pours a thick , oily black . some thin cola-like dark tan head that leaves no trace .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured out of the swing-top pint bottle an extremely dark , opaque , brownish color . looks much more like a stout than a marzen or oktoberfest.. tan head left a decent lacing on the glass , but was pretty thin .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours awesome , as about as alluring as u can get for double/imperial stout . straight up black with a a rich and creamy dark milk chocolate that you only see on the best of imperial stouts .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very hazy dark orange glass with loads of pinhead sized particulate matter , so much that the beer looks chunky . solid white head that holds and laces with tidemarks . flavor : hops go more traditionally ( for a us ipa ) citric and pine , but not very much . still a lot of earthiness , hop leaf is firm , with the semi-cloy sweetness mild enough not to be annoying .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a golden yellow with a nice white head , good retention , some lace .	000000000000000000
1	appearance : i thought this was a very nice looking beer ; the color was burnt orange that contrasted nicely with a large bright white head that reduced to a rocky foam . hazy . lacing was excellent . impressive so far .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pale yellow , without foam , nothing to note ;	000000000000

1	a : pours black , with a thick , creamy ( no pun intended ) off-white head , great retention , a thin , but full layer stays for the whole glass , nice .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a nice tan-red . head is glorious - 2-fingers with nice dissipation and brilliant lacing .	000000000000000000
0	a : pours thick black with only a centimeter or so of chocolate-colored head even with a rough pour . within a minute , the head has completely vanished leaving no lacing or even a thin ring to indicate the beer is even carbonated . even with a vigorous swirl , the beer stays as flat-looking as coffee .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the pour is absolutely beautiful . a hazy burnt orange color with a fluffy cream colored head which clings to glass .	000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a rather aggressive pour yields a huge two-finger white fluffy head with awesome retention . extremely fine , fast , and dense carbonation falls upwards towards it . it 's a friggin ' reverse waterfall . pale golden body that 's slightly hazy . color seems a bit light , but other than that , spot on .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pale yellow with a minimal amount of head . as i drank it , it did have a good bit of lacing left behind in the bottle .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : light yellow , to basically clear , even more clear than others	00000000000000
0	a : nice deep dark red/orange color with a small off white head that dissipates to a ring that stays there for a long time .	00000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a dark chocolate brown with a 1/2 inch thick dissipating tan head . moderate lacing .	0000000000000000000

0	a : poured a yellowish amber with some yeast floating around in it , and a thin head of white foam . what upset me were the little black bits rolling around at the bottom . yuck .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a pretty hazy straw color with light carbonation . about 3/4 '' of off-white head forms , very little retention and no lacing .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : head followed by thin lacing , though it vanishes quickly . nice color .	0000000000000000
1	a : whoa ! more head than beer ; as advertised , it 's black	000000000000000
1	appearance : pours black with hardly any light coming through at the edge . there is a thick creamy dark head , the nitro-pour makes this beer look great . a finger of head remains .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark brown with some brown when it catches light . the head pours pretty low about 1/3 a thumb , with tan bubbles . i would like a little more head . it drops out to nothing but a foam ring in a matter of seconds . no real lacing ... only some occasional blotches .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : incredibly light yellow ( piss-pale ) . light head and decent lacing . i hope it tastes better than it looks .	000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : clear bright amber glass shows a snowstorm of tiny bubbles that feed a full finger white cap .	00000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a golden , cloudy straw color with a decent semi-sticky white head that dissipates quickly but some sticks around throughout . some sediment suspended in the brew .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours almost black with an off white head that leaves as quickly as it comes . lacing is nowhere to be found . nice color body though .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a murky brown color without much head . fine enough .	00000000000000
0	appearance : pours a large 3+ finger medium-thin off-white head . heady fades too quickly for the style , popping and fizzing its way down to a thin cap . colour is deep auburn or sepia brown and is opaque . medium-low carbonation with tiny bubbles evident . head disappears totally and no lacing evident .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a dark black with a generous 2.5 '' tan head . the soapy head shows good retention with plenty of lace to leave behind . seems like a pretty active beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : extremely poor head retention , it foams up quick and drops like a glass of soda . the clarity is fine with a mahogany hue .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : huge foamy cappuccino frothy head from a slightly less-than-gentle pour . the stark , glowing white head dissipates into tight , tiny bubbles that float atop a light golden elixir . it gives a very inviting first impression to the eye . as it drinks down , the lighter foam breaks up into large frothy bubbles that stick to the glass at first , but quickly are reduced to a couple of spots of foam sparsely spattered around the glass -- no real lacing as the head dies down to a thin layer of foam .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a deep brown cola color with no head whatsoever . the only slightest bit of carbonation was a few tiny bubbles around the edge that barely made the rise to the top .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a nice thick head that eventually settles to a quarter inch . a great cloudy medium orange amber hue .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : black / very dark red . great clarity . just right carbonation with lingering creamy head .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : translucent and bronze red , with a light , off white head that turned into a shy ring of lace , which is sort of dissapointing , because i know it usually has more than that . maybe the keg was getting a little old .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pitch black body with some evident dark brown and maroon hues around the top edge . a rich , bubbly and creamy tan head was present for a bit and eventually rested as a patchy retention cap with some minor lacing . for a beer of this size , that is a seriously impressive feat and look ; absolutely gorgeous beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : clear , crisp , great head	00000000
0	a : pours an extremely pale cloudy straw color with a very fizzy white head that dissipates to a film quickly . nice lacing sticks around .	000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured a slightly cloudy golden honey color . a micro-suspension causes the cloudiness . three finger off-white foamy head that has very good retention . no visible carbonation . excellent lacing all the way down .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : golden amber color . no head/lacing/suds of any kind .	000000000000
0	appearance : golden straw color with sediment cloudiness , which i tried to keep it in the bottle . yet , i wanted a tad bit more beer in my glass that partially due to my careful pouring there was very little head development .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : plain yellow , like an american macro . soda pop type fizz . lots of internal bubbles . nothing worth looking at .	0000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : when poured into a pilsener glass , the beer was a nice ruby red color , almost brown in color with a big creamy almost 2 inch head of white foam . the head of foam had good retention , but did n't leave many rings or white sticky lace for that matter around the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : cork opens without a sound . standard pour yields a single layer of coarse , white bubbles that dissipates quickly . beer is a stunningly attractive clear red . no head retention and no lacing . i 'd make this mark lower , but the color is just incredible .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : the doubledog goes down with a thick pour , producing two fingers of fluffy , solid head with lotsa bubbles and pat steir-like lacing . looks pretty good .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very dark brown , nice head but no visible carbonation . carbonation is what makes me think beer wants to play . this beer did n't seem particularly friendly .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark walnut with a nice , thick chocolate milkshake-like head .	0000000000000
0	a : aggressive pour yields a murky brown beer with a slightly cream colored cap that disappears into a ring of bubbles on the edge of the glass and a small island in the middle .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy , nay , positively milky golden body with a head that disappears quickly and completely . it looks more like orange juice than beer , to be honest . less than great .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : i love the look of this beer . completely opaque like a good hefeweizen with the same golden hue . nice head and great lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000

1	a : clear golden body boasting three fingers of fluffy white head . retention is great and leaves loads of lacing .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : golden/yellow , very white puffy head that retains moderately well . minimal lacing . surprisingly light for an urbock .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : super looks ! ! served in a tall thin flute glass , the cloudy purple body and the pinkish fluffy head give it an immediate thumbs up . the looks alone are enough to have me thinking that this would be much better second time around* . lovely conditioning and a long living head , which is quickly reinstated as you swirl this brew , really do make for a good looking cassis .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : cloudy banana/orange straw color that really catches the light . thick 1 inch head that will not subside under any circumstances - less movement than iceman 's hair . medium viscosity .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured from a can into an irish pub style ( real ) pint glass in low altitude galway , ireland , on september 27th , 2010 . pours a dark tan/black . certainly darker than guinness . you 're treated to a brilliant display of bubbles as the beer settles , but the show is n't quite as good as with guinness . a two finger head that retains brilliantly . i love these nitro tap draughts . head is thick and creamy .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : dark rust color , hazy , with lots of visible sediment . head is small , carbonation is fairly visible .	00000000000000000000000
0	appearance : has a light vanilla head ( about 1/2 finger to start ) that dissapates into the medium amber body after a few seconds . as i look down from above i realize i might rather be blindfolded for this glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : murky and tawny colored body . prper head that slowly settles leaving a nice lace ring .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : pale amber in color with a little haze . no head , though this may have been the barman 's fault .	000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured a cloudt opaque light brown color ; looks like apple cider . no head to speak of and no visible carbonation . some lacing down the glass . overall , though , pretty dull and lifeless .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pitch black beer with nice creamy off-white . beautiful cascade as it 's being poured and nice lacing as well .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : brownish red , not much head , some lacing	00000000000
1	a : very cloudy orange . ca n't see through it . big off white head . very impressive here with its bright color . this is possibly one of the most attractive beers i 've ever had .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : black in color with a nice two finger head that slowly falls to a thick surface coating . thick lacing paints the inside of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the pour is all off-white thick head at first but then the pitch black liquid appears . the head is compact and about an inch high just before the dissipation starts , wait a minute - what dissipation ? the head stays as long as there is beer left in the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : one centimeter of headspace . a gentle pour fills the glass entirely - with nothing but a bright white , light and fluffy , airy head - and the most obnoxious staying power i 've ever seen . the body is light golden yellow-orange in color , murky , with a decent amount of small , dark particulate settled at the bottom . enormous clumps of the head remain attached to the glass on all sides .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a cloudy dark reddish/amber color . a beige head of over one finger forms with good retention . tons of spiderweb looking lace all the way down the glass . this ca n't look any better .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : ok , this is pedantic , but it 's simply not a pale ale . now , i did n't call it a pale ale ; ba did n't call it a pale ale ; the *brewery* calls it a pale ale . it 's not . it pours a clear amber to brown color with an impressive 3-finger head , not unlike a cask pour .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : flat out this beer pours like flat pbr from a fresh growler . the beer is clear , light yellow , and yields little head even from a rough pour . perhaps it 's not fair to knock the appearance on this beer because it is brewed with rice which offers no color really so all the color from this beer comes from the specialty grains . oh well , in essence i 'm not impressed especially given their ( barley 's ) general quality .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : nice off white head . plenty of bubbles coming up from the bottom center of the glass . the color is rusty , very cloudy , but an attractive red hue shines through . though it produced a nice 2 finger head , for some reason , it died quickly , and left a very thin , spotty film around the edge of the glass . this is unusual for me , as normally the head retention is pretty good . i 've enjoyed this beer many times , and this is the only time the head died like this , and not left any lacing . maybe my glass was n't too clean ?	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : served chilled in a pint glass . glowing cloudy gold in color with a half inch of decently thick white head . the color and cloudiness makes this look more like a heff than an ipa . head receded into a thin collar that left a few spots of lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : i am expecting a world class beer here and i get a slightly cloudy ( perhaps this is my fault - i knocked the bottle off a three foot ledge earlier in the day ) . regardless it is a straw yellow with hints of orange hue along with a fizzy white head that you hear buzzing away and disappearing post-haste leaving nary a dab of lacing . very disappointing start .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a clear yellow with a small sized white bubbly head . lacing is o.k . as the head goes down to a nice ring that lasts the whole time . i see some particles floating around too . unfiltered ? ?	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : wonderful golden brown , with a hint of ruby to it . beautiful , thick , ivory head . in fact , the head was up and out of the glass , which looked quite cool . thick lacing was left on the side of glass , so thick that i ca n't see out the other side .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a medium sized 2 finger thin white head that dissipates relatively quickly into nothing . you can see the carbonation at the top after a couple minutes . it 's orange-gold and has a bit of carbonation . no film , cap , or lacing and looks a little flat almost immediately . disappointing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : nice golden color . my pour came from towards the end of the bottle , so the yeasties clouded it up ( and there were some funky orange chunks of them floating in the beer ) but i could see from other pours that the beer was actually supposed to be pretty clear .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : looks a lot like a guinness but glowing amber in color with a thick creamy head that lasts the entire session . a thing of beauty ! ! ! !	00000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : dark brown mahogany in color , with some earthy amber tones . pours with a full 2.5 inches of rich , creamy darkish tan head that is very slow to recede , with great retention . it leaves some sticky rings of lacing down the glass . fantastic appearance .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : honey coloured and hazy . small head of off white appearance . not much resiliency to the head . sluggish bubbles embark on their quest to join the ring that forms around the edge of my glass . a weird piece of debris just drifted into my view . what the hell is that ? i hope that did n't fall out of my nose . lacing is manifested but not very pronounced .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a half finger head of fair cream and thickness but bad retention . colour is a transparent copper . sm : amber hops , caramel , sweet candied sugar , and maybe molasses . a mild strength aroma .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : from an unbiased point of view , this beer has a downright stellar appearance . it appears crystal clear and light yellow , with an enormous white head that exhibits admirable staying power . as the head finally begins its recession , it completely coats the glass with thick , caked-on lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a dark ruby . practically brown . head isnt exactly impressive . about half an inch and doesnt stick around for long . not aipa looking at all . at least there is some good lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a very transparent and clean amber color with no particulate matter or yeasties visible . a caritative head issued from the bottle as well and remained for a reasonable amount of time .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : beautiful coppery-red crystal clear color .	00000000
0	a : pours black with about a finger of light tan head that quickly recedes into little more than a thin ring with almost no lacing .	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this is a beautiful beer . a nice clear yellowish orange with a huge frothy white head . the head does dissipate some in the beginning but it has good retention . the bubbles leave behind rings of bubbles with each sip . i hope it tastes as good as it looks .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this one looks like a great beer . a deep dark brown with a slight red tint to it . a frothy finger thick head that dissipates quickly leaves a slight amount of lacing on the side of the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : deep gold . clear . vivid carbonation can be seen . tight bubbly white head has good retention and leaves some nice lacing behind .	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : perfectly clear reddish golden , great frothy white head with superb lacing .	000000000000000
1	a : pours w/ a finger of khaki head that dissipates really slowly .	00000000000000
0	a : clear , yellow , very bubbly . thin bubbly head . looks like a light beer . 1/5	00000000000000000000
1	a : the beer pours a nice bright golden color with a large fluffy white head , and decent lacing ...	000000000000000000000
0	appearance : clear yellow ; reminds me of when i 'm driving through iowa on a road trip on the interstate and all i see is corn fields on the side of the road	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : served a dark brown with a thin light brown head that left specs and a few streaks of lace down the glass .	0000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dark brown with slight haze . thick and aggressive head at pour which dwindles to a granular film ; present until finish .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy brown body swimming with particulate and topped with a big tan head that quickly dissipates leaving light foamy lacing and a thin bubbly cover .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : black as night and paper-thin , tan head . i imagine this beer with head that is appropriate for a porter and it would be magnificent . no such luck here .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : no real head at all . solid black colour . mildly appealing . sm : coffee , mocha , and alcohol . a mild strength aroma .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours , uh , black . looks like a stout , as it is classified on the site . one finger of mocha head with good retention , some lacing down the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a murky , turbid amber body in the glass . it is capped by a small off-white head that retains poorly and retreats into a thin collar on the beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the marzenbier is a dark lager , deep brown cut with orange/yellow highlights . a dead ringer for a bockbier . the ale produced a finger of head that was quick to dissapate to a small white band .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : standard pour yields a thin layer of off-biese head that dissipates quickly into a subtle ring around the glass . beer is a dark , near opaque blood ruby red . lacing is spotty and sparse with near no cling .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : golden with lots of bubbles and carbonation . small head , if any , barely any retention .	00000000000000000000
0	a : it 's an impy stout alright . inky black , absence of head . sort of ruby brown around the edges .	000000000000000000000000

0	a : poured a deep caramel , almost mahogany with a big bubbly off-white head . some carbonation , but definitely not pouring from the bottom .	000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : wow ! huge frothing head that forced me to ease up on the pour . clear straw yellow color with vigorous carbonation . fun to watch the head from the top as it actually surges and bubbles for minutes .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy amber-brown , no head .	00000000
1	a : the beer is clear dark amber and was served with a large , beige head . it has an amazing level of head retention and lacy patterns continued to cover the sides of the glass as it was sipped down to the last drop .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : wonderful cascading effect after the pour . settles pitch black with a thick , dense , creamy one finger white head . zero carbonation evident . laces beautifully down the sides , leaving rings , and head is very persistent until the end . lovely and unique looking .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy gold color has a lot of particulates floating around . the bottle does n't state that the beer is bottle conditioned , and i did n't see any yeast in the bottom . my guess is simply that it needs to have been better filtered . very little carbonation going on . white head is good sized but does n't retain well . leaves bits of lace .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : its a pretty nice looking saison . clear yellow . white head with infinite retention and really fine lacing . 4.5	00000000000000000000000
1	a : hazy straw ; fluffy white head , some retention , great lace .	000000000000000
0	a : hazy gold , with not much of a head or lace .	00000000000000
0	a : served in a half-pint straight glass , it pours a light-golden colour , with a foamy head at first but fast retreating ( quite unlike my previous experiences , when it had this very very thin but incredibly lasting beerhead ... ) ; the carbonation is very low .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured a very dark cherry color with a beautiful sticky head that did not want to leave .	00000000000000000000
1	a : almost 3 fingers of firm and rocky off-white head over a beautiful amber and dark orange brew . gorgeous retention and great lacing .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : pale amber , with a slight chill haze and active carbonation . a fizzy cream head is slow to form and retreats quickly to a ring at the beers edge . the beer 's weak point .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : light golden pour with a thin white head . it came in a green bottle which i somehow failed to notice when i bought . that 's worrying .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy amber/brown . not quite sure what the brewer was going for .	000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a deep but transparent brown with some red hues in it . ( `` brown ale '' about covers it . ) thin and slightly fizzy head that quickly fades to some wisps on top . leaves some good rings around the glass at first , but there 's very little lacing and head retention to be found .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : not much to look at . dark brown . opaque . minimal tan head . no lacing	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : very clear , yellow . chunky white head does n't last . no little bubbles or anything . looks kinda stagnant .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : this was a clear , deep golden orange color . it poured with a massive , craggy looking head that faded to clumpy lace .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a very dark brown , verging on black , with a khaki brown colored head , incredibly dense and rocky , excellent gobs of sticky lacing and great head retention as well . this is definitely on the dark side for the style , but it does n't look too bad .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : good color for a marzen ! nice copper tone out of the bottle and in the glass . about a single finger , maybe more , head that seems to dissipate before the first taste .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : the beer itself is straw-yellow , with a subtle orange tint , and brilliantly clear . the yeast , however , does not sediment well and unless i leave several ounces behind some `` chunks '' make their way into the glass . effervescent carbonation , with a pillowy white head and excellent retention/lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours amber with a mild white head , lightly fizzy , average retention .	0000000000000000
1	a : clear , dark orange with a thick , meringue-like head that leaves thick lacing . a very attractive beer .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : great deep copper color . beautiful half inch craggy pale white head that breaks up .	000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a clear amber color with two fingers of fluffy off white head that leaves some very nice lacing .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : thick , groggy and opaque chocolate brown . a crazy 2 1/2 finger tan head with unbelievable retention and great lacing .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : an aggressive pour shows off a nice , brassy/copper , but as it rests in my glass , it 's a clear , dark amber goodness . world-class , sticky lacing running all the way up the side of my sippie cup with an attractive vanilla colored head ( kidding , wanting to see if you were really reading this one ) . this baby is a thing of beauty to look at..	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : so pretty i wanted to take a picture of it in the glass . copper/ruby/brown with a tan head about 1cm thick . medium , soda sized bubbles . body looks a little like a hazy cola .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : 1.5 finger head . little lace . clear and amber .	0000000000000
0	a : poured from a bottle to a pint glass . had a copper color and a clear texture . there was a thin , foamy head that quickly dissipated . not much lacing at all .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : golden . a cloudy golden luster . most of it 's one finger head subsided after a few minutes .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a hazy dark brown with a long lasting foam and great lacing .	0000000000000000
0	a : the beer pours a cloudy reddish amber color with a gigantic head of white foam . holy foam batman ! i know how to pour a beer , but i still ended up with 4 inches of foam . looking through other reviews , this does n't seem to be an isolated issue . lacing is thick and soapy in nature and sticks around long after the beer is gone .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours deep orange , reddish amber color with a thick off-white head . some carbonation , a bit hazy .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : slightly hazy bright yellow . two finger fizzy white head dissipates to a thin white head , leaving pretty good lacing . not a great head for a hefe .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : opaque brown with a dark tan head	000000000
0	a : slightly less than one finger head on a sort of dull red-brown body . not sure if it 's chill haze or yeasty or what , but the appearence just is n't all that appetizing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a nice dark brown stout color with reddish tint . absolutely no head when poured and no lace afterwards . the consitensy seems a little thin .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a pitch black body . aggressive center pour leaves a 2 finger coffee-with-milk color head that has very impressive retention . each layer leaves another ring . very excellent looking beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : black liquid with a well-retained one-finger head . and of course the bubbles . they really are something different than most beers . head clings to glass as the beer goes down .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : apricot puree with similar clarity . a solid pour yields almost a finger of loose soapy white head . minimal spotty lacing seems subpar . 2/5	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : beautiful copper color with a 2-finger head , decent retention , perfect lacing . cloudy . love it .	000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a clear straw colored body . a 1 '' white fluffy head fades slowly to a thin film . quite a few clingy ragged strings of lacing are left behind and are still there when i finish the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : extremely clear amber beer with 2.5 inch light tan head that was still there 20 minutes after pouring . solid lacing after drinking .	00000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : man , this is 2 brasserie des rocs beers out of 2 that have the massive yeasty chunkiness going on in it . other than that , it 's a nice brown color with vague ruby highlights . the head is big and strong and will not go anyplace .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : dark brown-black body with lighter brown around the edges . creamy khaki head sits on top and retains pretty well . great lacing for a barrel-aged beer !	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : digiusting pink color , little to no head .	00000000000

0	a : deep dark brown with a beige colored head that dissipates fairly quickly into no head .	000000000000000000
0	appearance : dark brown , very little head that disappears to nothing within a minute . not an auspicious start .	000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a deep mahogany with a half-finger compact head that leaves lace all the way down the glass . this is a beautiful beer , but is far darker than a standard maibock .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : hazy golden , ca n't see through it . great head and lacing .	0000000000000000

1	a : nice cloudy gold color with a fluffy white head of 1 finger . good retention and nice lacing .	000000000000000000000

1	appearance : holy cow , maybe the most carbonated beer i 've ever had to pour . ridiculous - i poured fairly carefully , and there was maybe an inch of beer in the pint glass , and the rest was all foam . after settling down , it expanded to maybe 2.5 inches , and i was able to pour in some more beer . pale peach ( surprise ! ) in color , champagne like carbonation - copious amounts of bubbles streaming up from the bottom . rocky white head . pretty attractive beer , really , but be warned when you 're pouring !	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : lackluster head with just a ring of lace and a touch hazy	00000000000000
0	a : very dark orange and opaque . the be appears to be flat .	000000000000000
0	a : like most belgian dark ales , this one is unfiltered so it has this murky brown color with the light beige head . retention is sub par compared to other beers in this category . lacing is ok but also sub par .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : it poured clear golden yellow with a thin , white head . a light level of carbonation is visible .	0000000000000000000000

1	appearance : clear cold with lots of tiny bubbles rising and a big chunky head . looks very good .	00000000000000000000
1	a : this is just a beautiful beer . black as black can be . pulled from the very depths of hell for a color match . a good finger of dark tan head bubbles up slowly with some really nice retention . this stuff is sticky . very nice , it resembles dried up chocolate milk with slightly grain texture and thick and almost crusty on the glass . there is also a pretty nice filming quality to this beer as you swirl it in the glass , leaves a bit of a yellow film on the glass . i know this does n't sound appetizing , but it is damned impressive , for sure . i am very stoked about this brew .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : slightly hazy burnt-orange color with a yellowish tint . kinda looks like lemon iced tea . i did n't get any head at all , even with a pretty vigorous , straight enough pour , so i do n't really know what 's going on there .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a hazy medium copper color with a frothy head that never quits and leaves lots of splashy lacing ; even after the pint glass is drained , the head remains almost half an inch thick - astounding	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : light copper in color with no real head . no lacing develops .	000000000000000
1	a : darker golden color , with a fresh amount of bubbles running up the glass ... and a large and long lasting head , fantastic lacing all the way through , a rare 5 for me ...	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : it pours with a medium sized tan head that crackles away slowly but surely , leaving nothing after about a half a glass . the black body looks fine with brown edges , yet this is at best a standard look for this style . the head needed to be thicker and more compact . there was little to no lacing on the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : murky black , with a carbonation that looks like spit .	0000000000000
1	a : clear gold body under a gorgeous inch of creamy white foam that rises well above the rim of the glass . tons of ultra-fine bubbles rise through the beer to reinforce the epic ( for a half-pint , at least ) head . stellar .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : nice , dark amber with a red hue . pours with a great looking head , but that disappates all too soon . surprisingly foggy , but the carbonation sparkles nicely . very faint lacing all of the way down the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very clear with a very pale straw colour . the head is white , medium-sized and foamy and presents an impaired reteention ( little lacing ) .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : deep black body . large light brown head . good staying power . healthy sheets of khaki lacing left on the glass .	0000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured with 1cm of off white bubbly head that dissipated quickly and left no lacing . the beer is much lighter in color than i expected , it is a clear brown color that lets plenty of light through .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : this beer is quite hazy . it is a dark straw color , not quite honey , with an off-white sort of eggshell head .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : this was a mostly clear , pale yellow . there was a couple of floaties and not much haze , wtf ? it poured with a thin white head that faded quickly .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this is a pretty perfect looking old ale . it is a perfectly clear deep , dark ruby color that almost shines . the head is a thick , light brown , bubbly , uneven thing that sticks around for a while and leaves floating islands when its mostly gone . nice foamy lace in sheets .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : i always like the look of this . i dont know why buy i just loved the golden white foam color .	000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : the body has a dark appearance with good clarity and very deep brownish amber color . on top there is a huge light tan head that has great retention . it lasts all the way to the last sip slowly fading down to thin cap along the way . also it makes for some cool splotchy lacing on the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : thick reddish brown , thin lace , bubbly . think strawberry fanta with a little head .	0000000000000000000
1	a : an enormous 4 finger , light brown colored frothy/creamy head is produced on the first pour . rocky on the second . multiple air pockets eventually grow large enough to connect and leave a very uneven , lopsided head with excellent retention . the body is a medium dark amber and shows ruby tints when held in front of light . lightly hazy . remnants of the head stick to the glass in chunky sea foam splotches . the body leaves concentric rings of lace all the way down . this is gorgeous in a glass . s &	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pale straw and crystal clear . moderate white head with little lacing .	000000000000000
1	appearance : ten fidy pours a deep mahogany that does not relent , even at the edges . a full , creamy coffee colored head forms on the initial pour , gradually receding to a ring around the glass and an island in the middle . spots of lace decorate the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured an opaque , golden , yellow with a very impressive and thick head that just sat and sat and sat . it remained almost full for a good five minutes after a small 8oz . or so pour into a rocks glass . excellent lacing followed , covering a good 50 % of the opposite side of the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : deep golden yellow , active carbonation with a one finger white head .	000000000000000
0	appearance : rather flat looking medium orange-gold body . perfectly clear but it struggles to keep the very thin white broken head it arrived with , it soon gave up the fight to look like a pint of iced-tea .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : clear water with some yellow coloring , piss .	00000000000

0	a : dark but very clear burgundy with virtually no head	00000000000
1	a : the best element of this beer is the luxurious appearance . gorgeous latte-colored head with microbubbles that are longingly persistent . some nice lacing as well . deep and dark color on the double black stout , of course .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : good finger of head that laces and retains well . the body is a a cross between ruby red and cinnamon brown . steady carbonation is nice .	000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : hazy light orange body with an inch of creamy tan foam . if that were all , this would be a nice looking saison . unfortunately , despite a careful pour from the middle of the bottle , there are dark chunks swirling lazily throughout the beer and peppering the head . yuck .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured from a can , this is some dark , viscous stuff right here . the color is oil black . no light gets through it . it popped up a lovely 2 finger head . the head was craggy and dark golden brown - one of the darkest heads i have seen in quite some time . it 's a shamelessly handsome looking brew .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : moderate head , pale orange ; inert ; yikes !	000000000000
1	a : clear , straw yellow body rife with bubbles underneath a very pillow-y white head with some nice lacing . almost like a souffle of beer on top . pretty classic appearance .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : one finger head of slight cream , bad thickness , and poor retention . clear yellow colour . sm : barley , hints of cream , pale hops . standard lager smell .	00000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : yellow-gold with flawless clarity , two fingers of dusty white head , copious lacing . it does n't get better than this . 5/5	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : black color . frothy quickly disappering head . the on-tap version came with just a touch of head , but it had completely different characteristics . weird . 4.5	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured a golden color ... . no head , no lacing ... not a good start ... looks flat.. giving a 1.5 because it looks a little like beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : brown with an amber glow	0000000
0	a : comes out and hits the glass with the an as-expected golden haze . the head is pretty huge . it 's lively , frothy , 2-fingers and has okay retention . big drawback though , as i did n't get much lacing out of it . after a while it looked really flat , actually .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : black beer with a nice small light tan head that sticks to the sides of the glass . foam stays around	00000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pale chestnut with a fading orange-amber body , before i walked from the bar to my seat the head was gone , i mean like toe-taah-llee gone as the dumb blondes say in california . i think it was off-white , but hard to say . looks like a flat whisky . bit crappy in the appearance stakes .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : very murky and cloudy yellow ... looked like if you took a past its prime banana and blended it up . a lot of settlement in there . nice head that stuck around , very good stickiness to it .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : so the bottle said that this would pour a scarlet color ... and it did n't ... it was maple syrup colored ( not scarlet at all ! ) there was good lacing and decent head for the style , but it makes me angry when they say it will be one color , and it 's different .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a thick , dark brown body allows hardly any light to penetrate . what light does manage to make its way through manifests as brilliant ruby . pours a healthy caramel-colored , two-finger high head that leaves dramatic lacing . simply put , this is a gorgeous beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : wow , suspension in the beer , weird globules that i have not seen in a very long time are everywhere in this beer 's golden body . head is massive , 3 inches at the pour . so much for the appearance .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : poured a deep amber ( brown bottle ) color producing a cascade of effervescence along the insides of the glass reminiscent of sparkling fountain fireworks . this one filled the glass as a dark black but when held to the light it shone with ddep burgundy accents . the thick almost caramel colored head fizzled out slowly leaving huge amounts of residual lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : pours with absolutely no head ( due to its extremely high alcohol content ) . the beer is dark brown/copper in color and is rather thick and syrupy looking , slightly clinging to the glass with each sip	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : it has a solid black center with brown edges that reflect the light . a beautiful thick light brown head sits atop this beer . it does n't last very long , however .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : wow ! this is an exceptionally good looking beer . an opaque , solid , copper penny red beer poured into a snifter with a strong two-finger head resting on top . the lacing was very strong and covered a good 80 % of the back of the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : a very dark brownish black with deep ruby highlights and topped with an extremly bubbly and extremely thick one and a half inch head , little streams of carbonation bubble up from the bottom of the glass . the toffee colored head bubbles down into a quarter inch thick cap and leaves behind some rather thick lacing . difficult to imagine this thing looking any better , an absolute masterpiece .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : it looks quite appealing . golden brown with a nice foamy head that lingers for a few moments before settling as a ring around the top of the glass . this is a shade darker than your typical adjunct lager .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a light burnt orange with a fizzy uneventful head . fair retention , no lace .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : my sample glass had a one inch , fluffy white head that left a big ring of lacing after i downed the little glass . the waitress did n't leave any head on the actual glass , and there was no lacing either from the possibly previously existing head , nor from the beer itself . the beer is a rather unattractive murky amber that looks like it might have some greenish hues . looked more like dirty water than beer , but not really *that* bad .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : copper-amber color ; good head , but carbonation dissipates relatively quickly ; glass nicely laces	00000000000000000
0	a : super vigorous pour yields no head . maybe a couple of giant bubbles floating at the top of a ptich black brew . no lacing either .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : golden yellow , clear , with very little head , no lacing	00000000000000

1	a : cornlike , crystally yellow with plenty of bubbles . bright white head with strong retention . good looking kolsch . n : not much of anything . really need to seek out the malts , not much heartiness . minimal fruitiness and spices climbing to mostly lemon as it warmed .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : after a vigorous pour forms with thin large bubles and quickly fades away leaves behind an apple juice looking nectar .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : the head was a nice 3/4 '' fluffy off white pile . lacing is scant at best . this beer does n't look cloudy , it looks like someone dripped dishwashing detergent in it . streaky , gritty , and stagnant is how i 'd describe it .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours with a pleasing amount of head . head is frothy and white , looks almost whipped . stays around forever . lacing is impressive but not the best ive ever seen . this head will not die , and seems to form a thick , solid entity all its own . never seen anything like it colour is an appetizing orangish-gold , perhaps goldenrod if you 've ever seen the flower . lots of little carbonation bubbles coming up to the top .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : light auburn , peachy color with small white head that dissipates quickly .	000000000000000
1	a : three fingers tan head forms quickly , nearly overflowing out of my stein . dark brown with ruby and copper edges . creamy head hangs around nicely and there 's a frothy to lacing that becomes sticky . it takes a good 10 minutes before the remaining finger of head dies down , but not completely .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the pour is black , as i had expected from the name , and there is no head or carbonation to speak of .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : copper body , clear , with a light tan head and excellent lacing .	0000000000000000

1	a : pours with a pure white big belgian head and leaves wonderful lacing down the sides of the glass . very clear for a belgian , with lots of the obvious bubbles .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a bright orange & golden color . solid 2 finger head that finally settles to a finger . creamy looking . as i tilt the glass for my first sip , the other side of the glass is completely laced . wow !	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : light golden with good head retention and medium lacing . bone white head .	0000000000000000
0	appearance : in color , it 's reminiscent of grapefruit juice . it 's very pink with a slight orange hue to it . there 's a lot of haze in there . a forceful pour only yielded a foamy white head that was about a finger deep . it dissipated quickly and left no lacing to speak of .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : tar black . the softest , tightest head i 've ever seen . beautiful .	00000000000000000
0	a : milky orange-pink body with just a whisp of white foam that collects into a ring and leave a spot or two of lace . uninspiring .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured out a hazy , extremely pale yellow . not unlike the color you 'd find in homemade lemonade . the head was minimal at best , not even worth attempting a finger count . obviously considering the previous statement lacing was non-existent as well .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear golden in color . head and lacing could be better , they were pretty scant .	0000000000000000000
1	a : burnt sienna with a big white head . good retention , nice color , and lots of lacing . as bourbon barrel barleywines go , this looks great .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : slightly cloudy dark copper with an amber hue . no real head to speak of . almost looks flat .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours an opaque black with almost 3 fingers of mocha colored head . lots of big bubbles dot the top , and you can hear the effervescent release of the nucleation as the head slowly ( very slowly ) dissipates leaving a good bit of lacing around the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : chestnut-amber with a mild haziness . a half-finger of the tightest , densest khaki cream . terrific sheets of lace , foamy flecks completely covering the glass . only a few random carbonation streams .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear brown color . smallish head sans lacing .	0000000000000
0	appearance : pours a one finger medium looking off-white head with good retention . very little carbonation evident . somewhere around burgundy or burnt-umber brown in color . head slowly fades to a thin film . no head sticks around by the end and leaves no lacing down the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : sprecher really sucks at carbonation lately ; the bottle was a geyser when i opened it , while the beer itself has basically no head after a vigorous pour . body is an unassuming bronzish yellow .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : huge , foamy head that lasts quite a while . underneath , a bubbly golden liquid that looks very inviting .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : unbelievably pale , it looks watered down . it poured with a thin fizzy head .	000000000000000000
1	a : clear gold body with a striking pile of chunky white foam forming a pyramid of sorts above the rim of the glass . very lively bubble-bursting as it slowly recedes . the glass is something short of beer-clean , as there are tons of bubbles clinging to the sides , but that 's not the beer 's fault - on its own merits , it looks lovely .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : amazing dark chocolately brown color with small head	0000000000
0	a : quickly disapating sudsy head but pretty much no lacing . lively small rising carbonation , yellowy/green gold	0000000000000000000
0	a : pours with a 2 finger creamy light brown head . decent retention . the body is clear and medium-dark auburn/chestnut brown in color . ruby highlights only when backlit . the head applies a light smattering of lace to the glass but the body does n't contribute much more .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours into a duvel tulip a deep black with a one-finger , tan head . it 's tightly-bubbled and eventually shrinks to a full coating of foam covering the surface of the beer . lacing is spotty and abundant the full height of the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a deep , slightly translucent red , yielding about 2 fingers worth of off white head that recedes into a film of bubbles .	000000000000000000000000000

0	a : light amber , copper color . thin to medium head , with just a few bubbles rising from the bottom .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a lemony yellow with a billowing bright white head that took forever to slowly fade into a thick fuzzy film that left a solid sheet of lacing down the glass . this is how a tripel should look .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : i love the look of guinness draught as the bubbles appear to fall down and it becomes black then ... so cool looking . it also maintains a nice head throughout the drink .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a hazy amber orange . small hazy tan head , with fair retention , and low lacing .	000000000000000000000
0	appearance : light gold color with thick white head that dissipated quickly but what remained laced rather well for the first few minutes . unfortunately the head faded away entirely , leaving the ugly liquid with nowhere to hide .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : wow , an incredibly thick and creamy ( off ) white head with amazing retention ( its just not going away ) ! ! the color is a hazy amber with orange and golden hues . the liquid itself has a fairly thin appearance ( it slides easily up and down the sides of the glass ) . but , dammit , the head on this one is unbelievable ! !	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a hazy copper with barely a head . no lacing .	00000000000000
0	a : pours as a hazy semi-transparent pale color . the head has larger carbonation bubbles , and is pretty substantial . i 'd say it pours about an inch to an inch and a half and stands up . even with the large head i did n't get much lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dull hazy amber , fast fading head . not off to a good start .	00000000000000000
0	appearance : per gi 's website - srm 5 , pale honey ; which along with that accurate color description are some very small particles creating a hazy glow in the body . not much head development and it does n't last long either .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : nice yellow/golden color and cloudy . a nice head that didnt stay around for long and good lacing .	000000000000000000000

1	a : pours like your typical english pub ale . medium brown and murky with some golden highlights . an aggressive pour produces a tan , creamy head that disappears quickly .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : when poured into a euro style brooklyn brewery pint glass , this weltenburger is a clear dark amber with a touch of mahogany . the head of foam on this beer sucked ! it started off with an inch of white bubbles and then it quickly popped away into oblivion . after it popped away , it only left behind 5 white bubbles acting as the rings . there 's no way 5 rings could leave any lace . back to the drawing board weltenburger .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark amber and rich in color with a big , tan , fluffy head that stays amazingly fluffy throughout-looks like icing on top of a glorious holiday cake . sticky , spider web lacing throughout . great appearance .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : deep copper-brown with ruby highlights , light tan head , no retention , leaves a little leg .	00000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear , bright copper color . the tall head has a soft orange tint and a fluffy , rocky , foamy texture . retention is impressive , leaving a nice cap of rocky , chunky foam for a nice while . extremely impressive lacing sticks peskily in narrow concentric bands . for what it 's worth , one of the best looking beers i 've ever seen .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : lovely transparent honey-orange with about 2 fingers of frothy white head . head retention as good and clings to the side of the glass nicely .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : crystal clear golden honey color with a 1/2 inch white head that quickly fades to a lace atop the brew , very good .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a gorgeous super clean amber-red . 1-finger head dissipates quickly to a light , slightly sticky ring which leaves no lacing . very light carbonation - just the odd rising bubble .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : cloudy amber , it poured with a big fluffy , sticky white head with lacing . if it was n't cloudy , this would have been a 5 .	0000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : come on now , how could this look any better ? this is the definition of belgian ale .	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a very clear deep red color with a pretty creamy looking 1/2 '' of tannish bubbles that has plenty of staying power and looked pretty much the same a minute after the pour . most of the way through the beer , there is still over 1/4 '' of head on the beer and lace smeared all the way down . i seriously do n't know how they could possibly improve on this for the style . kudos !	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a deep brown body , with a 1/2 '' tan head that fades to a thin film quickly . only a few small dots of lacing are left on the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : my glass was just a little warm , which turned the entire thing into head . now that it 's calmed down a little , and it looks good - black , nice tan head , great retention , really nice lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a half finger tan head of nice cream , good thickness , and rather laughably poor 10 second retention . in fairness , this was poured into a snifter , but come on now . non-transparent black colour . sm : extremely light scent ; all me broken nose can make out is malt and caramel . not a great combination in my book .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark , but not black	0000000
1	a : i 'm going to set the tone early and state the appearance is the best thing about this beer . the pour is nearly black with a thin ring of khaki colored foam .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a deep amber brown body . 1-1/2 '' tan head fades to a very thick film . very few tiny carbonation bubbles rise slowly from the center of the glass . leaves quite a bit of lacing on the glass , lots of long thick strings and big dots .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pale golden amber . slightly hazy with some nice off white head which seems to really be hanging around .	0000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a golden copper color with a light in texture foamy head that leaves some nice lacing .	00000000000000000000
0	a : pale golden body . 1/2 '' white head that did n't last long & left little lacing .	00000000000000000000
1	a : pours three thirty three in the morning darkness . fluffy head was roasted caramel and pecan coloring . the lacing plastered around the glass like chocolate brown curtains in willy wonka 's living room .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : golden , sparkling , thick head with staying power , actually one the prettier beers i 've seen .	000000000000000000000
1	a : this brew looks fantastic . it 's golden in color and slightly hazy in appearance . it has a ton of head and retains it well . good lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a rusty copper with reddish hues . not really brown per se but still nice looking . slightly clear with a voluminous head and great retention . lacing drapes the glass as i drink it .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours pitch black with a 1/2 finger tan head .	000000000000
0	appearance : pours a slightly ruddy , light-to-medium brown with a fine , 1/8 '' , off-white head ; light-to-moderate ring lacing .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : golden , with a slight unfiltered haze . topped with a fizzy 1/4 '' or so of white head , which drops rapidly to a half-cover of film , gathered at the edges . a few steady streams or carbonation , otherwise it 's pretty dormant . on closer inspection , there are some sand-like brown bits of , presumably , yeast resting on the bottom . a few bits of sticking lace . those dark flecks are pretty unappealing , which is why this gets a below average mark ...	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : darkness is what it says on the bottle , and darkness is what is inside . it pours a midnight blackcolor with just a hint of slightly off-black molasses in the very tip of the glass . darkness indeed . a creamy dark tan coffee head mellows in its creaminess , then recedes , reforming with every swirl and leaving some unexpected lace on the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this one took a lot of crap for being flat when it came out . not the case here . it opened with a nice hiss and even gushed slightly , though slowly enough that we caught it in glasses and did n't spill a drop . it 's a clear amber body , with great , long-lasting carbonation ( streams of bubbles up the center of the glass ) . its ample 1 '' head lasts and lasts , leaving great lacing and a substantial cap the entire time .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours a nice clear copper color , with off-white head . leaves a decent amount of lacing on the glass .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : pour a cloudy glowing tangerine color with a huge , thick , billowing , and oily looking light cream colored head that took forever and a day to fade into a rocky layer of foam while leaving a sticky network of dense lacing down the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : slightly hazy orange-amber body with only a wisp of superfine carbonation . kinda flat , but i 'm not too surprised .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured a honey-gold color with good carbonation leaving bubbles and a small white cap	0000000000000000
1	a : damn , this looks devilish . the body is a thick black , like a stout ; what a full color . the head is awesome , a dense , foamy three fingers of excellence . its a light tan cream that sticks around for a hell of a long time , with a strong showing of web-like lacing when it finally comes down . it even darkens to an oily dark brown when i swirl the glass . impressive .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : quickly dissipating cream-colored head , dark amber color with no lace	0000000000000
1	appearance : poured with an amazing billowy white head . this thing just wo n't recede . cloudy , wheat-beer coulour . beer is bottle conditioned , with a lot of cloudy yeast on the pour .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : caramel colored and very opaque . pour does not have lots of carb . and settles down with a light ring around the edge of the glass . light to moderate lacing . ( 3.0 )	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : super pale watered down looking . maybe a finger head with an aggressive pour that is gone within the minute . no lacing .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours out a murky brown color with an almost-white head . not all that much to look at .	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : the cascading action is a beauty to watch . when all is said and done , the beer has a jet black body with hints of red barely penetrating through the body . thick , creamy two-finger vanilla colored head that sticks around the entire time and leave massive walls of lacing all the way down the glass . guinness is , in my opinion , the best-looking beer out there .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : slightly hazy , medium amber color with a peripheral ring of off-white bubbles . light lacing remains on the glass .	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : when poured into a pilsner glass , the beer was a nice golden amber color with plenty of carbonation bubbles racing through out the glass . i got a big 2 finger white head of foam that left some lace and plenty of rings around the glass . the rings will last the entire duration of drinking . excellent !	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : this beer has a thick tan head that tends to last for the majority of the beer . the beer is black and can not be seen through . mouthfell : the beer has a very light mouth feel . the beer is almost creamy when drank .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : 1 inch head , black , with a light cocoa looking head	00000000000000
1	appearance : the best thing about this beer . first of all , it has probably the coolest looking twelve pack box in the store . nice bottle . thick , light tan head . dark copper color .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours golden with a soft white head , fair retention .	0000000000000
1	a : pours a dark red amber . a little more than a finger of head with great retention .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : bright gold glass struggles to hold a soapy white cover . head fails to hold and only gives up spots of lace . flavor : nice german yeast , noble hop toasted barley thing going , but theres that metallic edge at the finish that really calls the cops on the party . theres a vegetal note that comes out as it warms with a musty side that really doesnt help much .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : nice dark reddish brown with a excellent fizzy head .	000000000000
0	appearance : pour is dark brown ruby red . little-to-no head with zero retention and zero lacing . light carbonation flows throughout .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear , vibrant gold body with two inches of fluffy white foam on top . good retention and some fine , solid lacing . you ca n't really ask much more from this style appearance-wise .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : eat your heart out budweiser ! ! ! a commercial-quality looking beer . monster 4 finger frothy white head that just spills over the top and never seems to dissipate . beer is crystal clear yellow . lacing is thick with nice legs and great cling .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : it 's very clear and light golden in color . head is foamy white and about a finger deep . virtually no retention or lacing to talk about .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pale , boring , some ok carbonisation . little lacing	000000000000
0	appearance : orangey and hazy ( got the bottom half of the sample this time ) .	00000000000000000
1	a : pours a crystal clear , dark amber/rusted red color . a frothy , eggshell , two-finger head sits beautifully atop the beer . this is a pretty looking brew for sure . over three decades of brewing this recipe has certainly perfected its appearance .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : as soon as i saw it in its tulip glass in front of me , i knew i was in for something special . dark brown transluscence with a nice pinky-width of head . holding it up to the light shows inviting bubbles . a thing of beauty .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : viscous , with a body as thick as motor oil . the head is a dark brown , and it grows fast to a solid 3 fingers . i do n't think i 've ever seen a head this aggressive on a super-dark stout like this - but i love it . sticky lacing is everywhere , and , if you pay close enough attention , you can catch a quick glimpse of some yeasty sediment before it disappears back into the darkness . black , bold , and beautiful .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours copper colored with a bit of white head that disappears quickly and leaves just a halo and lacing	000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a really nice dark black that lets barely any light in at all . got a good finger of head from a careful pour , so the head is very vigourous . the head is dark mocha in color and has some serious staying power . it only recedes a touch and the head remains for the entire beverage experience . lacing is spotty , leaving just a touch of soapy bubble goodness on the glass . not a bad looking beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : 24oz can high gravity another malt liquor during our sampling of varietal malt liquors , appears pale golden white head dwindles quickly leaves specks of lacing not too apetizing .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : clear and yellow , medium carbonation , pours with a head the width of a finger . 2/5	00000000000000000000
1	appearance : 5 |	0000
1	a : pours a deep brown with a healthy , foamy head . good sustain with massive lacing .	0000000000000000000
1	appearance : it 's exceptionally dark . i 've heard it compared to used motor oil before and i have to agree somewhat . you ca n't shine a light through it , and if you get it on while clothes , it stains a charred brown color . if you do n't pour it correctly , it can develop a somewhat massive head .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours a hazy , ruby-tinted brown with a thick , fluffy , beige head that fades to a thin film leaving sheets of lace on the side of the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : not sure what to call the color , somewhat orange with a hint of pink and a pronounced pink head .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : i have to say this is a beautiful beer . clear , deep purple body and a small , fizzy pink head .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours an opaque black color . the light brown head is small and rather short-lived . lacing is minimal . well , ok ...	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : thick , black menacing liquid with virtually no head and barely any lacing . cold carbonated coffee filtered through an offensive linemen 's jock strap ? does n't look too great , but that might not matter too much .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : cloudy dark mahogony color . big head retention with high amount of lacing .	0000000000000000
1	a : very clear , only slightly yellow in colour . pours with a ton of fluffy white head ; not much retention , but it initially leaves a nice lace .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a very deep dark brown with very red/copper tones around the edges	00000000000000
0	a : pours out the classic hazy glowing orange of the best hefeweizens out there , the difference here being in the size and duration of the head which remains no more than an eighth of an inch or so above the beer for the duration of this particular review .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a very lively medium-dark-gold , carbonation bubbles climbing to the top of one of the best heads i 've seen in a while . half-inch of bright white head sits on top of this bubbly looking brew , retention is near incredible , staying between 1/4-1/3 of an inch throughout drinking , leaving behind layered white lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : perfect pitch black with a thick 2 inch mocha colored head that slowly fades . exceptional !	0000000000000000000
1	a : gold with moderate micro rising carbonation . mild head retention , fluffy and varied carbonation .	000000000000000000
1	appearance : i am a sucker for the nitro pour - the cascading reminds me of those guinness commercials from ten years ago that convinced me that drinking guinness would make me mysterious . after the cascading stops , the beer itself maintains a dark brown color with clear ruby parts with thick , creamy , nitro-induced beige foam on top .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours a semi-cloudy brown color with orange highlights . the head is monstrous for a glass like this . 2 '' tall with varying bubble sizes . craterous surface with gobbs of stick lace . excellent retention .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : deep yellow w/ hint of orange ... . pretty clear with a little carbonation visible , about 2 fingers worth of head that settled to a ring , with wonderful lacing ... great looking beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : dark ; nice foamy head .	00000000
1	appearance : there is no more beautiful beer to look at then a stout in which the bubbles cascade down like like rows of psychedelic curtains . amen .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : 1.5 fingers of pure white head . well carbonated , golden amber , no cloudiness . very nice looking beer .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : pours pale yellow with an average white head with no lacing , average head retention , not bad for a macro lager .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : pale yellow , with a white head , which looks good in the beginning , but dissipates rapidly .	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this was a light golden beer with hints of amber within its depths . a coarse , white head rose up to two fingers and dissipated quickly . being fed from below by a heavy bead , a thin layer of foam remained to cap brew for quite sometime and even left quite a bit of lace on the glass . i was surprised to see this from a lager .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dark brown , translucent , with a circlet of lace .	0000000000000
0	a : pours an opaque black . no head to speak of , does n't matter how aggressively i empty the bottle . does not leave any lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : basically looks like urine . not pleasant at all . i usually try to explain the appearance a little more , but there 's no two ways around it ; this stuff just is n't very appetizing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : yellow with a green tint . no head .	00000000000
1	appearance : crystal clear golden color , with bright white bubbly head and wattery lacing .	0000000000000000
0	a : poured a clear amber with a quickly-dissipating head . bubbles rose slow to the top , almost like it was under-carbonated .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : absolutely no head and lacing , but had a nice orange-golden appearance . pretty typical for a barleywine .	000000000000000000000
1	a : that is a truly beautiful beer . a deep brownish red color , like cherry or mahogany . a decent bit of slight tan head .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : bright gold beer with crazy high carbonation ... snow white head forms from a vigorous pour and settles into a 1/2 inch creamy cap which leaves a bit of lace .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : extended pour yields an unpward cascading 1 finger coarse , off-white head that collapses as quickly as it forms into a thin wisp of foam atop the brew . beer is a cloudy , near opaque , mud-water brown . i can see the clay-like sediment at the bottom . not the most appetizing beer to look at . lacing is non-existant .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : opaque black or very dark brown . light tan head about 1/4 '' thick , slowly disovled . little visible carbonation . nice lacing left on glass .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : no head ; maybe a goblet was a poor choice of vessel for this beer . amber-copper colour ; semitransparent . sm : alcohol . a delightful complex mix of hoppy	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a three finger tan colour head . lovely cream . beautiful . excellent thickness . the head is perfect , delicate , and soft . the retention is incredible for the high abv ; i 'd estimate about ten minutes . colour is a solid nontransparent black . sm : light aroma of cream , pineapple and other notes me broken nose ca n't distinguish . very light in strength .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : cloudy orange , no head , no lacing . dull appearance .	00000000000000
1	a : pitch black body with three fingers of fluffy dark mocha head . rentention is good and laces amazing lacing .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : it pours beautiful mahogany , with an off-white head that takes some time to dissipate , and the it leaves nice lacings . it looks great ! ! !	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : straw yellow with little carbonation .	00000000
1	a : dark brown with three-finger , tan , creamy head that lasted a few minutes . pretty good lacing .	000000000000000000000
0	a : very clear golden yellow . the half-inch head became a thin film within two minutes of pouring . sudsy ring around the collar at the half-way mark .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours straw yellow from a clear bottle . non existent head with lots of carbonation .	000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dark amber with an eggshell-hued head that settles quickly . carbonation and lacing are decent , but this beer throws way too much sediment for it 's style .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : the body of the beer is a clear deep copper coloration . the head is white and resolved to a ring of foam rapidly .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : tiny bit of white head , body is reddish amber in color . bits of lacing .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : big creamy and thick light tan head with a well painted trail of lace all the way down to the bottom of the hazy very deep brownish red brew .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : amber body topped with a subtle low retention head , some lacing .	000000000000000
0	appearance : poured a very transparent and clear light red/amber , basically the same as a kentucky ale . however , there was zero head ( only a collar of bubbles ) and zero lacing . occasional carbonation bubbles rise , more so when the glass is swirled for agitation . when i first poured it , i thought i got a bad batch , or maybe i just did n't pour it vigorously enough . beautiful color , though .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a cloudy , burnt orange color . the head is ridiculously big & frothy..almost too much ... even with a gentle pour . it does n't dissapate either . retention is incredible..probably has the longest staying power of any beer i 've sampled to date . leaves a nice lacing on the glass as well.. impressive from a so-called fruit beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : i really wanted to give this beer a high appearance score because it is crystal clear but i simply ca n't . the body is pale straw but the head dissipated immediately . i realize that the color is correct for the style but it simply is n't appealing to me .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a rich golden beer , bright and clear , with very little carbonation action , and initial thick white foam that teases , but does n't follow through and cowers to a lackluster wispy white foam head .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : beautiful appearance , almost opaque . lovely dark brown color .	0000000000000

1	a : 1/2 '' of khaki head on a deep ruby copper body . consistent , even layer of film/lace left on the glass as the head recedes . moderate retention . clear as a bell .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a beautiful dark black , that draws you into the nothingness . light can not escape . the legs are an oily , viscous , 10w-30 affair . this is a beautiful beer . if it had any carbonation , it would be a 5.0+	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured from a bottle to a pint glass . had a black color and a thick consistency . there was a big , creamy , tan-colored head and excellent lacing . a great looking stout .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a slightly hazy , golden body with a substantial , fluffy , and long-retaining off-white head . it clings to the sides of the glass as it falls , and it remains a decent cap on the beer for the entire time that i 'm drinking it . outstanding .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : crystal clear medium-amber body , verging into copper , topped by 2 '' of dense , creamy tan head . great retention and lacing . this is an absolutely spot-on ipa appearance-wise .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a jet black with a serious cappuccino colored head . i 'm talking four fingers here . and it lingers . there 's no light getting through the beer though . i like seeing that .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : color was very pale light yellow and reminded me of something ... what could it be ? it attempted to sustain a head but there was n't much chance of that . moderate carbonation is present and an oily residue kind of hangs around on the sides of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a one finger head , extremely thin , devoid of cream , and of very poor retention . cloudy orange colour with floating yeasty particles . sm : light scent of berry esters : primarily cherry . no citrus . refreshing . a mild strength scent .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured from can into ( non-real ) pint glass in low altitude galway , ireland on september 18th , 2010 . pours a clear yellow with an abominable , thin head that quickly reduces to nothing . a pathetic appearance that looks a bit like urine - ca n't wait .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : standard pour yields a .5 finger frothy , creamy white head with great retention . beer is a clear brown . lacing is thin and stringy with good stick . one of the best looking beers of the style i 've seen to date .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : bottle dated 5/21/10 . poured into a large snifter . colour is a rich brownish-red . big two-finger head fades with mild lacing . a moderate amount of carbonation is visible .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : black with a couple of fingers of light-brown head that looks like a pancake on the griddle . the head lasts for a few minutes and leaves lots of lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a deep golden-orange body with an extremely thick , creamy head that leaves its marking all over the walls of my glass .	00000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : served to me in a 20 oz glass . the color is a golden copper , that reflects a honey-yellow tint when held up to the light . the glass came to be with minimal head , which faded away to leave lacing on the edges and a layer of foam on the top .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours a cloudy amber orange color with a nice finger of head at the top . a lot of lacing going from head to toe on my tulip glass . the head retention has been excellent has i keep on sipping .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : this one poured a burnt ornage hue but bright orange when held to the light . the frothy white head stood up to be recognized and maintained its standing power for quite some time , leaveing behind a thick trail of bubbles . also you can find lots of beading floating vigoriously to the top .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : very pale yellow with very little head and poor lace .	0000000000000
0	a : pours a clear yellow . perhaps urine . appears undercarbonated . four finger head of no cream and okay thickness . surprisingly decent retention . not appealing , but not awful looking . sm : clean barley . thank yhwh it does n't smell malty ; this has been a huge problem with ibiza beers .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a thin , nonaggressive head with a little lacing and very little carbonation . it 's a pale straw gold color and seems just a little hazy .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : light amber color	00000
0	appearance : pale gold , slight haze , some floaties , even layer of creamy white foam	00000000000000000

0	appearance : subtle orange with fast rising bubbles and a big long lasting white head .	0000000000000000
1	appearance : good foaming action and the clarity is nice as well in its pale yellow colour .	000000000000000000
1	a : pours amber with a big foamy head . great sustain with tons of lacing .	00000000000000000
1	a : the body is black but does allow some light to come through , illuminating it with deep persimmon glints ; above is a thin cap of fine light-brown foam that sticks around admirably and leaves tons of lace . excellent .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : sits hazed and honey-colored in the glass , with a moderately thick layer of white froth on top . as the head descends , it drags a blanket of cobweb-like lace in its wake . head retention is n't too impressive , nor is clarity , nor is the color or even carbonation . other than the lacing , this really does n't have much going for it .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : golden body with a pure white head . looks just like it should . two things in particular impressed me : the clarity of the beer and the size of the head given how long it probably took to get to me after the pour . unfortunately , the appearance was the best aspect of the beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : free pour fails to yield a head , instead leaving a small foam ring around the surface of the glass that gradually dissipates to almost nothing . pours a clear reddish amber , and leaves no lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a deep , ruby red color with a thick , creamy head that dissipates down to a thick cap and leaves some spotty lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dark velvety black color . small dark tan head forms and quickly becomes a small collar . not a very heady beer . kind of disappointing , but the black color of the beer is so seductive .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : orange-yellow body , some effervescence , no head to speak of . dissapointing .	0000000000000000

0	a : poured a murky orangish color with no carbonation , no head or bubbles	000000000000000
1	appearance : ruby red hue , very nice looking beer . a slight head .	000000000000000
1	appearance : dark morning piss yellow ( sorry , if it sounds vulgar ... ) . i would probably describe it as brownish/reddish yellow with amber copper reflets . good head of white foam when pour . it did n't lasts for a very long time .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear golden yellow in color with a small white head , very little lacing .	00000000000000000

1	appearance : brownish-red , huge head .	0000000
0	a : like pale yellow water . no head at all . highly disappointing .	000000000000000
1	a : pours a fantastic deep gold that tiptoes the edge of being red ... maybe an orange-red ? this beer is exceptional looking . a beautiful 1/4 inch tan head showed no signs of dissipating until the last sip .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : light brown head of medium density on top of a beautiful dark ruby body . crystal clear as far as i can tell . head stays for awhile ; just nice to look at .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a very deep near opaque brown , with a thick creamy dark tan head . excellent retention and lacing .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : auburn color with a thick head and some of the stickiest lacing ive ever seen . nice looking . n : a bit of malt and a layer of caramel . not too strong .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a cloudy reddish brown that seems to boast quite a few particles on yeast and ginger i would assume . anyways , a pinky of creamy head that retained amirably was produced .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : smells a bit like an ipa . some toasted malts , citrus hops , caramel , and some spice . not as pronounced as i would have expected .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : the body has a medium brownish/red color with a very clear appearance and visible carbonation . this seems very odd to me for the style . on top is a thin white head that quickly fades out to just a wispy thin ring of bubbles that makes no lacing at all .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : very dark with a nice brown foamy head that disappears leaving a decent soap-like lace .	000000000000000000
0	a : flat , murky mahogany . does n't look good at all .	00000000000000
1	a : pours a very dark brown with a reddish purple tinge . topped with a seemingly perfect pancake batter bubbling head . excellent lacing and very good retention .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : light copper bordering on brass with such a light hue . pours a billowy white head off the tap , which slowly fades to a thin but persistent coating over the top of the beer . good clarity though it appears to have a slight chill haze . flavor : light bread with hints of kilned melanoiden malt and carmel notes . earthy hop bitterness is very low . a malt focused pale , but the malt profile is light and somewhat mottled .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark purple-brown , a couple fingers of tightly formed espresso head , moderate patchy lacing , looks good . 4/5	0000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a slightly hazy mahogany with absolutely no head , save a few large bubbles that were a product of a vigorous pour .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : a nice looking brew . a deep amber color with a decent one-finger head that did n't need much coaxing . dissipated pretty quickly to a ring around the beer . left some spotty lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : very cloudy , hazy . color is a dirty , ruddy dark gold/bronze . small thin diminishing head . does n't look like an alt , and worse , is not pretty to look at .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours an extremely dark coffee brown with a billowing dense latte-foam colored head that slowly faded into a thick oily film that left rings of fine lacing down the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured a hazy amber orange with a little bit of head . absolutely no lacing alongside the glass . head disappeared quite quickly .	00000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : interestingly , the dark amber body reflects a pink light onto surfaces , which is set of by a luscious head of foam .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : amber , almost no head , and even that small head dissappears almost immediately . really not impressive .	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured a slightly cloudy , very dark red/brown color . 1.5 finger head , light khaki and & # 8220 ; pillowy & # 8221 ; . retention is very good , with the head sticking around for a while and then keeping a thin layer . very good lacing up and down the glass . very little carbonation .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a very pale gold color , with a small white head that stays for a while and leaves a good lace .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a crystal clear light yellow with a soapy white head that dissipates rather quickly . a fair amount of carbonation floats up toward the top of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : tree-bark in color and super-clear , this brew has an off-white film that leaves rings around the glass . lacing is evident , but not particularly significant .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear amber with a ruby hue and topped with a generous off white pancake batter head . good retention and great lacing .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a pale straw hue with a 2-finger fluffy head that quickly dissipates and ends in a minimal lacing .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : excellent creamy white head with good lacing down the glass . toasty yellow color , hazy .	0000000000000000000
1	a : did have a great look . dark , dark , dark , with a small tan head .	00000000000000000000
0	a : pours a hazy dark caramel ale with two fingers of yellow and creamy head . the head falls to a solid billowy sheet of the same . spotty lacing . orange hues sharpen where light passes through this murky ale .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : it has a very pale straw color that is very clear with lots of visible carbonation . the head is thin , white in color and fades out quickly leaving no lace behind .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : black with an inch of creamy tan foam and nice retention . lots of lacing is left on the glass .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : one of the most beautiful beers i have ever poured . a jet black motor oil of a stream cascades into the wine goblet . a large coffee-colored head that recedes ever so slowly . no light gets through this one .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured into a weizen glass , brilliant hazy yellow orange `` radiated '' from the glass , a small amount of head that looks like `` yellow cake uranium '' floating atop this magnificent looking beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : it forms a thin white head that quickly fades leaving just a few small bubbles on top . the body has a light golden color with very good clarity . ( apparently this is a filtered wheat beer . )	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : into it 's proper glass , it pours a clear , pale gold with the characteristically massive head that intially takes up more space than the liquid . the head leaves gobs of sticky lace down the inside of the glass . tons of bubbles race to the top , from the heavy carbonation . a truly classic appearance ; if this does n't rate a 5 , nothing does ...	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : this beer poured a light amber to the eye , but the actual beer is seemingly darker than what was poured . the head was 2 fingers at its maximum , but wasnt too fond of hanging , so he bolted , leaving a lacy layer on the top .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours black with some amber-cola color coming through near light . large brownish head dissipates slowly and leaves behind thick lace spots .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours dark black with not head whatsoever . a small ring of bubbles formed around the outer edge .	000000000000000000000
0	a : pours with an unimpressive 1 finger head , foamy and fizzy , off-white in color , and it diminishes quickly . the body is almost opaque and earthy orange in color . heavily particulate on the last pour . spare lacing . not a great start .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy yellow color , non filtered , the surface is orange , two finger of foamy head without consistency , but good retention ;	00000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : top marks for the catwalk looks , the off-white head is thick and crusty . high conditioning levels keep the head at least throughout whilst leaving some clinging lacing that swirls in clotted patterns . the hazed orange body looks murky but the marmalade frontage is nice enough .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : dark as night with the faintest ruby hue . thick , two-finger brown head .	00000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a cloudy yellow . slightly orange . even with a heavy pour , and a stout swirling of yeast in the bottle , i got very little head . that which i did get , disappeared quickly .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : crystal clear golden amber with tiny bits of sediment wandering about . the dfh signature glass keeps very steady stream of bubbles flowing to the top that keeps the head from disappearing completely . s/t/m : of all the ingredients , honey dominates the smell . when i try very hard i can sort of make out the peppers , but really i doubt i would have thought that if i did n't know beforehand that they were in there . the taste is less honey-overwhelmed . while certainly prominent , the chocolate and peppers come through effortlessly in the taste . for a dry tasting beer has kind of a slicker mouthfeel than i would have expected .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this beer looks great . pours a gorgeous copper color with a thin head that dissapates quickly . slightly opaque . this beer practically glows .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pretty ugly , like a mud dark sloudy brown color with a little head . n : somewhat hoppy , spicy , little dark malts , some creamy malts , slight sweetness .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : looks good a little darker than most pale ales .	000000000000
1	a : nice orange color , slightly cloudy with a touch of white head on top and just enough retention for the style .	000000000000000000000000

0	a : hazy , medium golden color with one finger of persistent off-white foam head . moderate lacing remains on the glass .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : completely transparent , large-bubbled fizzy head that dissipates immediately . it looks extremely overcarbonated , like an energy drink , even after 3 minutes . no lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : light straw color , delectably hazy , luscious stand of frothy white foam , lacey	00000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a nice , truly golden stream and is a pure amber in strength . head was abundant but dissipated quickly and no lace to speak of .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : deep , deep brown with some mild highlights . extremely hazy and dense . head is a light beige color , but dissipates quickly .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a vigorous pour produces only an average sized head , creamy and white in color . retention is short , but a collar persists . the body is a light yet radiant yellow-orange hue which starts out very clear , but becomes opaque towards the end of the bottle as the yeast sediment is incorporated . other than the color of the body , the appearance is pretty disappointing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : served in a tall uniform and rather largish wine glass , this looked the part when it arrived . a glowing yet murky looking , marmalade orange color with little to no head whatsoever .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : very pale pour . decent white head . little lacking in the color . bordering straw , just a little darker .	000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a dark mahogany with a fizzy off-white head , fair retention , muddled look . not the best looking stout in the world , but i do n't care with how good it tastes .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : gentle pour yields a 3 finger fluffy mocha head with great retention . beer is a clear , nearly opaque black cherry color . lacing is patchy and stringy with great stick . every dark beer should look like this .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pale yellow-straw color , lots of carbonation , and a large bubbly head that disappointingly shrinks to a small lacing and eventually disappears .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : nice deep black	00000
1	a : a brilliant amber red hue . good head and great lacing .	00000000000000

1	appearance : tres blueberry stout is a very opaque , dark brown color . this is one of the darkest heads i 've seen on a stout . the color of the foam is almost a charcoal gray mixed with brown .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : hazy pale amber , darker than a lot of tripels i have had and the lace is just ok as it leave only a ring .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a muddy brown color with no head . some spotty surface bubbles are all that arrive with the pour . no lacing develops .	00000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pretty dark and cloudy -- muddy .	000000000
0	a : pours a translucent orange with a soft white head , average retention .	000000000000000
0	a : straw yellow and surprisingly clear , with a fluffy white head that fizzes away too quickly ... light lacing . odd for a wheat beer .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a very clear , transparent light urine color with a 3 '' tall , foamy white head . the retention is excellent and the beer leaves lots of sticky lace on the glass . some bubbles actively move to the surface of the beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : mahogany hue , lasting , and i mean lasting creamy tan head , good residual foam and lacing .	000000000000000000000

1	appearance : reddish amber and clear .	0000000
0	a : red-orange-brown blend with a little ring of foamy head . a little too translucent for a barleywine .	00000000000000000000
1	appearance : black as black can be with deep ruby accents on the bottom . medium khaki head which recedes fairly quickly to cover the entire top of the beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the red color and the rose head gives a nice aspect to it . reasonable retention and many lacings left around	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured into a duvel glass ; even with a light pour , 50 % of the glass was filled with a dense head . color was surprisingly light . i 'm always impressed with the `` fountain effect '' of bubbles making their way from the bottom of the tulip glass to the head .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : beautiful tan head of nice cream , good thickness , and great retention , especially considering the high abv . wow . dark copper colour . semitransparent . sm : amber hops , caramelized malt , alcohol , a sort of buttery note that mixes with the caramel . pleasant albeit strange .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : one finger head of slight cream , decent thickness , and poor retention - though in fairness the abv is 9.50 % . colour is a cloudy yellow . sm : very malty , light spice , and full barley . a moderate strength aroma .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : 3-4 fingers worth of foam covers a light copper body . the head lasts quite a while and leaves lasting traces . well done .	000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : ruby , and brown , with an consistent head .	000000000000
0	appearance : hazy yellow with a nearly nonexistent head . it really just does not look appealing , quite frankly it looks like urine in all honesty . ( i apologize if i 'm offending anyone but thats what it honestly looks like .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : yellow-gold in color with a nice distribution of carbonation . the color was much lighter than i thought it would be after trying a few sips from other bottles . the head was decent and seemed to want to stick around which led to some great lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a slightly hazy gold with a huge 3 finger white , rocky head that fades and retains at a 1/2 finger skim . tremendous sticky lacing clings all over the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : typical of an american adjunct - fizzy , pale gold , frothy white head with no stamina .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours out a standard-issue black body with an inch of light beige foam , though this eventually dissipates entirely .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : beautiful deep tawny copper color . looks great and inviting , with a half finger head that lasts . good lacing . great appearance .	000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a slightly translucent reddish-orange color . the orange/tan-tinted head is quite tall , reasonably dense , and foamy , with a somewhat rocky texture as it slowly fades . lacing is superb , layered continually down the sides of the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : black color pours from the bottle creating a finger and a half worth of thick coffee brown head . sticky lacing all down the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a beautiful amber with a perfect head , excellent lacing , lively carbonation	0000000000000000
0	appearance : dark brown to black color . small head when poured aggressively . no lacing . flavor : more fruit carries over to flavor . medium coffee flavor and roast that carries into aftertaste . medium bitterness , no perceivable hop flavor .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : wow ! pours very dark with a huge , billowing cream-colored head that lasts for quite some time and leaves behind multiple rings of sticky lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : brown . i mean it 's pure brown . a big fluffy 3 finger head quickly dissapated to nothing .	0000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a translucent yellow with a minimal-to-no head .	0000000000

1	a : pours a slightly hazy orange with two fingers of white head that fades into a dense white cap with good lacing .	000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : shocking ... a beautiful copper and amber pour with an abundance of white head calls me from the glass .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : dark brown with carmel legs . nicely carbonated with though it lost its head quickly	00000000000000000
1	a : huge 4 finger light brown rocky head sits atop a dark brown nearly opaque body . only when the beer is held in front of a light source is the clarity noticeable ; ruby highlights appear . the head lasts forever and becomes increasingly lopsided . excellent lacing sticks in chunky sheets that are punctured by bb pellet sized holes .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : standard pour yields a 1.5 finger , creamy , semi-fine , white head with moderate retention . beer is a clear orange ... and when i say orange , i mean the most orange that orange can get ! lacing is outrageously ample . thick , web-like froth covers the glass in layer upon layer . just giving it a swirl creates new foamy patterns . excellent .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear amber with golden hints with two fingers worth of white creamy head . settles to a thick head and covers the whole glass with foam .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : carbonated water with the faintest hint of yellow	0000000000
0	a : mostly black . the pour produced a quarter of off white head that retained well and left some great lace . but , it 's black .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a clear golden-straw body capped by a finger of whitish head that fades quickly and leaves bare lacing .	000000000000000000000
0	a : murky orange-brown body with some sediment . no head , but good legs . underwhelming , but not entirely unexpected .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : pours nearly opaque black with just a little bit of brown around the edges . a first a small tan head forms , but continues rising to over two fingers . the tightly packed foam gently recedes to a ring that sticks throughout . lots of spiderweb looking lace is left behind .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : deep orange/amber with a one-finger offwhite head which quickly dissapates into a thin layer across the top of the entire beer . lacing is pretty consistent throughout the session . a very nice looking beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : it looks like a lager	0000000
0	a : piss-colored yellow with white head which quickly dissipates .	00000000000
0	a : poured a golden color with good carbonation and a small white head	00000000000000
0	a : no head , no clarity . dark amber in color .	0000000000000
1	appearance : pours a very dark charcoal cocoa , entirely opaque , and a moderate pour yields a very nice and incredibly creamy finger of moderately tanned head . the retention is excellent for a barrel aged beer clocking in at 11.6 % , though as with all things it ultimately fades to a thin sheen and a thicker ring , replenished consistently by gentle but plentiful carbonation . the lacing on the sides of the tulip is what elevates this beer from a good looking beer to a great looking one , however - huge sticky , creamy swaths of delicate and thin on the one hand but also glittery and runny lacing dominates the glass landscape , proving that just because a beer 's spent nine months in a barrel and weighs in at supra 10 % does n't mean it ca n't also have very attractive and clingy lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a clear golden yellow . large fluffy white head that does not last and leaves little lacing . carbonation is ample .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : light piss color w/ ok head and almost no lacing	000000000000
1	appearance : deliciously golden orange , great color . lots of fun junk floating around . beautiful froth . looks great !	0000000000000000000000
1	a : a bright watered down piss colored beverage pours out to my chagrin , i was hoping they accidentally filled the bottle with horse piss as it would probably taste better . it 's clearer than a babies butt on a window and even magnifies my finger prints on the glass making me worried i might have stolen this glass without realizing it . it reveals many little bubbles rising to the top . a nice big head rises up with a nice lacing on the glass surprisingly as it fades back to a light head covering . n : a light pale adjunct like aroma wafts out . it 's better than a typical american macro , but barely . i get some light pilsner malt aromas that are actually pretty nice . very light hints of lemongrass and some wheat . i get some light cereal aromas too .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a little too pale in my opinion , but has the great carbonation tracings running up the sides of the glass like the real deal . comes with a very insistent and frothy white head that sticks around for a little while ( but not really long enough ) .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : very deep brown color with a finger of creamy white head . quite a bit of lacing as well . nice looking beer .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : very dark . almost pitch black , but with a very faint brownish red around the edges .	00000000000000000000

1	a : pours a vigorous 3 finger fluffy fine white head with great retention . this one hung on for dear life till the very end ... brew itself is clear golden . lacing is weblike and ample and really covered the entire side of the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : light brown/amber in the pour . nice 1 finger white head .	00000000000000
1	a : aggressive pour yields 1 finger of off-white head . texture of the head is like fried egg whites - large and small bubbles evenly mixed . dark brown liquid with a peachy-red edge when held to a light . good head retention . very attractive beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured a pale yellow with a long lasting head .	000000000000
0	a : black with dark , chestnut highlights , tan head , no retention or lace .	00000000000000000
0	a : very little head retention , golden/orangish in color .	00000000000
0	appearance : bright golden with an ever so slight chill haze , medium sized bubbles nonchalantly make their way to the top to keep the thin white lace in form yet to no avail the head vanishes for good .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a very dark brown with some light coming through . there is a finger and a half of thick tan head and great retention .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : light gold in color and slightly cloudy . the color took me off guard as i expected this beer to be a bit more orange . the head dissipated quickly and left me with a slight lace around the rim of the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : smells like rotten fruits , with notes of green apples , lemons , and sour cherries being the strongest of the bunch . some toasted malt is there , too , along with some bretty funk , vanilla , brown sugar , and a little bit of cocoa powder . it smells like nothing i have ever come across before , that 's for sure !	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : color is the same yellow as dehydrated urine . head is white , not alot at the beginning and none after a minute .	00000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours really , really light and transparent . produces a one finger , medium looking , off-white head with decent retention . black body and no carbonation evident . head fades to a slight wisp and ring . a ring remains until the end but leaves no lacing down the glass . way too transparent and thin , and the head is far too light . does n't look like an imperial stout .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : possibly the lightest beer claiming to be an ipa that i 've seen . clear and light yellow with a gorgeous 3-finger white head , excellent retention , gorgeous lacing . excellent	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a dark black , viscous looking beer . pours with an impressive , frothy mocha head that dissipates very slowly . tons of lacing .	000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : after popping the cap , the slightly tan head overflowed from the opening , good thing i had my glass handy . after the pour , the head in my glass settled into a quarter inch , dense layer . the foam in the bottle keeps slowly rising out . the beer is a dark brown with a little amber in there as well . it seems very lively as i can see minuscule bubbles rising , some sediment in there .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : soba ale pours a somewhat hazy deep golden color with very orange hues . there is a nice off-white head which leaves a very modest amount of lace on the side of the glass . the head drops down quickly . some carbonation is visible through the haze .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : slightly hazy golden colour with a poor head , just few big bubbles . however , when i had this from cask at one of the otley pubs , it poured with a thick creamy head , and this is the thirs different otley beer i have had from bottle that has show a crappy head . anyway , the carbonation is very light too .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clouded brown into a chimay chalice with a finger of tan head that hangs around for the drinking experience . not a whole lot of lacing left on the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : flat . looks more like cough syrup than beer . but of course the same could be said for all of the bt variations . min lacing and dark as dark gets .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : liquid black gold , great head , with good retention , amazing after all it was a cask , it looked soild black , and i barely let the light pass through the glass ! !	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : looks good , golden amberish yellow with foamy white head that diminishes faily qulickly	0000000000000000

0	a : pale hazy yellow , almost no head	000000000

1	a : dark beer , but ruby red and crystal clear when held to the light . i 've never seen such a dark , yet clear beer . tiny bubbles that cling to the side of the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a clear pale yellow color with a wispy head that breaks down immediately .	00000000000000000
1	appearance : a clear ruby-red to brown beer ( you could indeed call it mahogany as the bottle says ) that poured a 1/4 '' light tan dense head . however the head died down to a thin ring around the edge of the glass and a very thin little island in the middle of the beer . very little lacing - every now and then but it slowly slides back down . slow bubbles moving up through the beer . i 'm digging the color , but the lack of head and lacing is a bit of a bummer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : the flatness of this batch of angel 's share , or any other beer that experiences some carbonation issues , is , in my opinion , not so much a problem for the drinking experience , as it is a problem for the visual aspects of the beer . no carbonation means no head and no lacing . i tend to place a lot of weight on a beer 's lacing , in particular , and to a lesser extent its head , so when there 's just nothing in my glass upon constant swirls , i have to give it a low rating . body color can , of course , make up for where the lacing or head lack , but this one is a sort of off-brown greyish black that is just , well , not appealing at all , especially when held up to a light . that being said , i do , when i hold it up to a light , see some slight carbonation bubbles ! additionally , if you put your ear up to the glass , you can hear some definite popping . my bottle 's been sitting for some time , so it 's possible that this is because the yeast is beginning to do its job . i would n't , for what it 's worth , call this beer completely flat .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : dare i say this is the best looking beer i 've ever seen ? it pours a deep amber-red with great clarity and awesome carbonation . nice 1.5-finger white head with great retention that leaves just fantstic lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy orange with no head basically .	000000000
1	a : the '94 can is fuzzy ... i 'm going to assume that 's from being cellared in my sock drawer and hope it 's nothing else . that aside , both pours look very nice ... clear light amber color with active carbonation .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : not so clear as i expected . a rich mahogany , reddish brown with a thin cream-colored head that fades quickly , leaving a small lace .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a dark bronze body with a line of cream colored lace with a lot of retention very mild lacing .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : as transparent as i 've ever seen an imperial stout . i can see light right through the center . the head is foamy and disappears in an instant leaving no discernible lace .	000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : very nice clear amber with a thick white head .	000000000000
0	a : amber with good clarity and minimal carbonation . very small cream head does n't stick very well , but does leave spots of lace .	000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : dark cloudy brown that showed some light at the edges . whipped frothy brown head of a good finger and a half is starting to dry in the center . looks like it will outlive me . flavor : the smell mirrors the taste , with the addition of even more molasses and long roasted malt . spices top the taste , mild pepper and clove . a dry bitter aftertaste last longer than it should .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours out a dark brown , completely opaque , forming a big fluffy head . amazing retention - as it very slowly recedes , the brew leaves a wall of sticky lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : amber with the slightest haze . the head is quite nice -- big foamy bubbles around the outside and a big marshmallowy dollop of finer creamy bubbles in the middle . fades to a thin layer . pretty nice lacing . good looking beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a beautiful pale yellow , chardonnay perhaps . with a full 2 fingers of fluffy white head . this my friends is an excellent looking beer .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : black , black , black ... . about 2 fingers of beautiful tan head . a nice ring thought the session ... . best lacing i 've seen for a while .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : head : dark khaki , fluffy , long lasting body : roasted , hoppy , coffee , chocolate	00000000000000000000
1	a : poured a deep cocoa brown color with great carbonation leaving a rich brown head . this looked amazing !	000000000000000000000
0	appearance : deep brown , hardly any head , good clarity	00000000000
0	appearance : it poured a darker than brown color , but not as dark as i would have expected . head was okay .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : the head is large , 3 fingers high , rocky/frothy , off-white and long lasting . the body is clear with a medium rich color of amber mixed with honey brown . lacing is just a notch above good . s &	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : perfect ! ! ! an awesome brown color with a very generous creamy neck of foam . never had so much fun to pour a beer in a glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours an opaque , dark red color , solidifying into a mahogany . some light gets through , but very little . the head is thin but with dense bubbles and is a beautiful purplish pink hue , very unexpected and nice .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : crystal clear straw colored beer with a bone white sea foam head . this is perhaps the most translucent beer i have ever seen , it 's like glass . large bubbles burst and soon the foam lowers by about an inch leaving just a bit of lacing . edit : crystal clear halfway through until about 2/3 of the way through the bottle ... then gets all san francisco .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : huge bloom of carbonation ; thick head ; pale , cloudy yellow color ; lacing decent for this style	000000000000000000000
0	appearance : the most noticeable thing about this beer is , sadly , the unnecessarily vapid head . it barely forms , then evaporates into nothing but an oily film on the surface of the otherwise lovely , thick , coffee-black body .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : huge head , dark black , chocolate colored	0000000000
0	a : opaque dark brown body . small loose head that dissipates quickly leaving no lacing and no cover . how is that possible in an oatmeal stout ?	00000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : dark brown in color . good head , light beige in color .	000000000000000
0	a : light purple color , foamy 1/2 '' head with very little retention	00000000000000
1	a : not bad looking at all . pours a dark brown in color that builds a seemingly black body . held to the light , you can see the browns and reds coming through but this is dark and opaque . the head builds a little over a finger of mocha colored foam . it falls pretty quickly though , down to a thin top cap that lingers through the drinking experience . no lace to speak of .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : kind of an ugly beer , it poured a cloudy dark amber with very little head or lacing .	000000000000000000000
0	a : well it looks like a stout ... fairly dark but i 've seen darker , little to no head on it though .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a pale straw body with light haze and off-white head . decent retention .	00000000000000000
0	a : dark brown with only a thick ring of toasted cream foam and spotty lace . opaque .	0000000000000000000
1	appearance : man , this is basically like what i envision with i think of `` ale . '' pours with a massive two and a half finger head just slightly off-white with a hint of tan . lacing is thick , consistent , long rainbow arms of stuff . the body is a beautiful kaleidoscope of golden straw , red , and brown . really nice looking .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a murky soft apricot body with active effervescence up the glass , continuously replenishing a light beige head . throughout the drink there 's an even half-finger of foam capping the brew , with gorgeous , sticky lace down the sides of the glass . unbeatable appearance .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : painfully clear light yellow with a frothy white cap that left a lace mark on recession from pour . nice thick lacing all the way down the mug from a long lasting head . flavor : standard american lager taste , clean , crisp , weak malt water taste with a rather harsh metallic twang at the end . dont know if it is a canning issue or just a bit off or maybe a hop artifact . also just a slight orange experience , but it may just be suggestion from the name .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a surprisingly rich amber-gold body with tons of carbonation sustaining a two-finger head of dense white foam that sticks around seemingly forever : by far the best head i 've ever seen on a beer of this style , it verges on being `` rocky '' - really impressive . still , it 's fizzy yellow beer , so i ca n't bring myself to award the 5 , even though it looks amazing according to style .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a clear , light golden color with a thick , dense off-white colored head . good lacing down the glass .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a cloudy orange - slightly darker than usual - with a small bubbly head . almost no lacing .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a very pale yellow with a small white head that quickly disappeared to nothing . leaves no lacing .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : poured light straw yellow , hazy , light white foamy head , no lacing	0000000000000000
0	appearance : unusual copper color with a fizzy head that quickly disappears without a trace	000000000000000
1	a : aggressive pour yields 3/4 finger white head with good retention . clear golden colored liquid . decent though fizzy .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : crystal clear amber orange color with a thick almond colored bubbly head and some really nice lacing .	00000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear gold with a pallid white head , solid retention , spotty lace .	000000000000000000
1	a : thick & viscous ( surprise , surprise ) . color is jet black with absolutely no light passing through anywhere . aggressive pour yielded an active bubbly chocolate colored head which dissipates but not completely , leaving a nice frothy layer on the surface and around the edges . lacing is relatively boring and minimal .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pale golden color , managed half a finger of soapy-looking foam which died away to a few small arcs of bubbles within 10 seconds . no lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a light copperish amber with nice foamy white head that sticks around quite a bit . with around 2 to 3 fingers in width , it fades to a simple blanket . poured an entire bottle into a standard pint glass . towards the end of the pour , i noticed some dregs floating around in my glass that muddied the beer . a little surprising as i thought it would have been filtered a little better .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a hazy ruby tinted dark amber color with two fingers of off white head . the head fades quickly and just leaves a ring around the edge . this is a nice looking beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear and dark copper and topped with a rather fizzy , none too substatial off white head , that fades into nothing , no lacing either .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : it pours an opaque chestnut brown ; the color is a bit flat . there was no head and no real lacing . the whole appearance of this beer is just heavy and flat , not very exciting looking .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : bad appearance , very cloudy and murky , no head whatsoever , bland orange and brown color	0000000000000000000
0	a : this is where the horror begins , just a fizzy no headed yellow beer ...	00000000000000000
1	appearance : a great looker , with a massive head that sits atop the chestnut colored liquid ; wonderful retention and lacing	0000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a gray/yellowish color with an average head that fades within 3 minutes after pouring . not impressed .	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : bright amber orange with a big head that is white with tint of tan . great retention and lacing .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : a hazy golden/straw color with a pretty solid white head .	0000000000000
0	a : dark amber and very cloudy . looks thick like a light maple syrup . not a lot of head , carbonation or anything on the glass . not much to look at to be honest .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a cloudy , copper-orange body with a small off-white head that vanishes quickly . during sips , some curtains are left on the sides of the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : evenly cloudy orange/amber color . poured a 3 finger fizzy off-white head that dissipated to skim along the inside edge of the glass . laced in some intermittent spots .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : when poured into an oversized wine glass , the beer was an extremely nice golden amber color . the label was n't lying when it said it was going to be a golden ale . when it was poured , the beer was nothing but a pearl white head of foam . when it finally settled down , the beer still had that nice head of pearl white foam , as well as white foamy rings and plenty of pearl white lace around the glass . a small skim of that foam still remains after the beer is almost all gone . it does n't seem to want to leave . i ca n't say enough good things about this appearance .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : plain , boring , clear applejuice color , slight carbonation . no head nor lacing .	000000000000000000
1	appearance : amber color with a very white head . head was fairly thin and did not last very long with a minimum amount lacing .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : chocolately brown beer with a huge 2 finger head dissipating slowly ,	00000000000000
0	a : pours an extremely pale and dull yellow . this defines straw colored . tight carbonation of tiny bubble leaves a 1 finger white head that recedes to a thin layering .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : golden colored . definitely filtered . big loose head to it .	00000000000000
1	a : right off the bat , the appearance is fantastic . it 's a dark beer the color of molasses , allowing beautiful dark brown tones of color to show through when held up to a light . the head stands about the width of my small finger , and sinks to a sliver across the top of the beer . it is a light tan color , and looks milky smooth across the surface . lacing is already starting to build .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark orange/red almost burnt ember hues .	000000000
0	appearance : pours a thick , clear amber with minimal head .	000000000000
1	a : dark amber color , with a slight reddish hue . after pouring the head formed up high and fizzed down with vigorous carbonation , but the remnant head is more creamy looking , a light amber color .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : served a clear honey amber with a dense off-white nitro head that left a stereotypical sheet of nitro lace down the glass .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured from a bottle to a pint glass . had a dark brown , almost black color and a thick , opaque consistency . there was a big , tan-colored , creamy , long-lasting head . great lacing . a fantastic-looking beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a deep , cloudy golden-orange . stark , white 2-finger head has excellent retention , leaving an immense amount of lacing on the glass as it recedes . beautiful .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : transparent yellowish-orange color with a head that was almost non existent . very unimpressive for a draft beer .	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : arrives at the table with an espresso brown color with tan highlights and a mocha head that retains beautifully and sheets the glass with lace	000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dark copper color . it resembles caramel a little . the round bottom of my glass makes it look like a caramel covered apple . anyways , there was a small light tan head that minimizes pretty fast . not that much lacing for this pour . it looks good , nothing special though .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this may be the perfect beer from an appearance standpoint . excellent , deep brown ( but not black ) color and excellent head retention .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a slightly hazy amber color with a nice head that webs lacing around the pint glass	0000000000000000000
0	a : this ale poured with very little head , not a bad thing for an ale as far as i 'm concerned . the body is a rich cloudy and earthy brown ( bottle conditioned ) . the head ( which left a tiny ring of lacing around the glass ) is best described as beige ... a good colour in this instance .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : the beer is a very light yellow color , with a short white head that fades very quickly and leaves very little lace on the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : copper , huge head from the pour - sticks around forever - very nice appearance .	000000000000000000
1	a : caramel-amber with robust 3-finger rocky off-white head with good retention and copious lacing .	0000000000000000
1	appearance : the look it terrific . it pours a dark garnet brown with absolutely loads of lacing plastering the walls of my glass like a curtain .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : light brown head with major cascading effect and long retention . it 's also creamy and coats the glass all the way down . body is a dense brown color . simply gorgeous .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a deep brown with large floaty chunks visible on the surface . not much head . having trouble getting past the chunks in this .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : zesty , crisp , floral hop aromas . stone fruit esters , biscuit malts . a little bit of spice .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : pours an opaque , burnt-orange with an impossibly creamy and pillowy dark khaki colored head on top . retention is fantastic ! gobs of sticky lace were left clinging for dear life to the inside of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : red/brown pour with no head , not necessarily attractive .	000000000000
1	a : pours a very clean , just of white one finger head on a dark brown body . by clean i mean it just came out as head and there it was . it did n't do the guinness falling bubbles thing , it did n't look small and then foam up huge , it just was . held up to the light the beer has a reddish copper hue with lots of active carbonation and is very clear . head fades and leaves a little lace .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a light coffee colour that ends up looking black w/ a creamy 1 finger head . the head lingers the whole time and plenty of lacing	00000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a slightly darker than gold into a victory shaker pint . it 's only slightly hazy and is topped by a tight-bubbled eggshell-colored head that holds at almost a finger 's height . this is what beer should look like .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this beer is a clear chestnut brown coloration . the head is a light tan coloration approximately 2 fingers high . the head resolves into a thin foam .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a ruby red or very reddish amber color with a very tiny head that actually left lace on its way down .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours an amber golden . 1/2 finger , egg white head diverts to 1/4 finger within a couple minutes . sporadic lacing along edges . head easily agitated to original height with a spritely stir .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : dark brown almost black . thin brownish ribbon of head	000000000000
1	a : there is nothing wrong with the way this looks in a glass : hazy light golden with a great looking head . lacing is apparent and plentiful .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear , straw color with a giant 3 finger head after a generous pour . recedes to half a finger 's worth of off white head on top .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : holy god . i did n't pour very vigorous out of the can , and it resulted in a 4 finger eggshell head topping a golden yellow , almost copperish color beer , and the head stayed around and left lacing all over the glass . settled into a nice 1/8 '' cap and leaves sticky lace after every drink . this one is off to a fantastic start .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : morning piss . yellow . yummy !	000000000
0	a : golden honey brown colored body with a bubbly , rocky and creamy looking head . a nice retention ring is left behind , along with sticky lace on the walls . unfiltered floaties are unmistakable in the body , as mentioned there might be should you pour this out . really , they 're just ugly and kill the looks of the beer . i ca n't help but think this is part of the reason they recommend drinking from the can ( other than the hop aroma retention ) .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours out a clear , light orange-hued , honeyesque in color body with a rather tall , almost glistening , near white head .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : perfect . nice deep ruby red with hints of brown and an medium off-white head that quickly resides .	000000000000000000000
0	a : big pour yields no head as carbonation struggles to escape from the brew . beer is a dark , near opaque brownish-black . no head , so no lacing . a bit on the flat side even given its style .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a nice reddish amber color . goes right along with the name . it had a tiny head that left no lacing , points away for this .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : transparent golden blonde , with a significant amount of carbonation that forms a moderate amount of off-white foam . the head settles quickly , but leaves a bit of foam in the center of the glass and along the side of the glass . faint lacing is noticed as the glass is tilted .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : black glass shows some clarity at the edges and holds a tan head that laces in heavy clumps .	000000000000000000000
0	appearance : light brown , hazy , with almost no head ( just minimal bubbles forming around the edges ) . no lacing .	000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : light straw color with a small amount of white head . plenty of carbonation streaming from the bottom . very clear and looks inviting , almost like summertime in a glass	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : uhh , this is a stout ? a great imperial stout ? i could barely pour this one because it was foaming over for minutes . poured out a dark red , nowhere close to dark . were any dark malts used here ?	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this looks exactly like fred . this was a clear , pale , golden copper color . it poured with a huge , fluffy , craggy white head that was sticky and long lasting .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : brown colour and a huge 4 cm head that lasts . 5	00000000000000
1	a : syrupy , black body with a generous 1.5 inch head . the head is creamy with a dark tan hue . leaves a lot of lacing around the glass and has some stay to it .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pale yellow color . poured with a 1-finger soapy-looking head which died away leaving just a few scant bubbles around the glass . left almost no lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a half finger head of fair cream and thickness , but terrible retention . colour is a nontransparent copper . sm : lots of fruity tones , a light air of vinegar , and malt . moderate in strength . very pleasant and inviting .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : light black and good clarity despite the dark colour . head : light brown and low head with very poor retention ( no lacing whatsoever ) .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a hazy orange with a giant white head that slowly fades to a ring and leaves a ton of lacing .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : deep orange amber with thick 2-finger , light beige head with good retention and thick patches of lace on the upper half of the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000

0	a : fizzy-yellow . a little cloudy . nice , 1 inch head at first but it dies to nothing fast . strong carbonation . does n't look too appealing .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : cloudy , grade a `` dark amber '' maple syrup . poured a huge , off-white , billowy head that extended well beyond the rim of the glass , then receded to something resembling a bubble bath .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : the appearance is an orange / yellow body with a creamy white head .	0000000000000000

0	a : this beer pours what i would call a standard head from the bottle . just over 1.5 fingers to me , with medium sized bubbles that do n't look like they 're going to last . and it does n't . beer as very little carbonation , and is a clear coppery orange color . maybe the slightest haze .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : dark chestnut to amber body that has a massive tan colored deep creamy head which laces the glass walls exceptionally well . this looks fantastic in an imperial straight sided handled mug . the head wrestles the beer and a swirl unearths some hidden dissolved carbonation . its a drinking beer is this one and the look is that of a great esb or premium yorkshire bitter .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : large 3 1/2 finger frothy/creamy head . pure white and long lasting . the head begins to attach itself to the glass in large chunks as it recedes into a rocky cap . despite the sticky head , the lace that the body produces sticks sparingly . the body is a light yellow , pale gold color and very , very clear . minimal visible carbonation .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : clear golden color , lots of bubbles rising to the surface , meeting a decent head that holds well at the top and clings nicely to the sides . even so , it does n't look especially attractive . i assume this is a simple , one-dimensional american ipa .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : very cool label . it shows the famed beast in its signature stride and reads `` untamed and imposing . '' the head is a magnificent dark brown color that contrasts perfectly with the pitch black yeti .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : a brown pour makes a one finger , medium-thinner looking , fizzy , light brown head with decent retention . noisy one . dark brown body , relatively transparent , with no carbonation evident . head quickly fades to a wisp and ring . only a ring remains until the end and leaves dots of lacing down the glass . a little under par here .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a real thick foamy head atop a pale , brownish red body .	0000000000000000

0	a : light brown with orange to copper with small tan head that degrades to nothing quickly . still which is okay but the haze is not . another negative on appearance is the twist top . s/t : a mildly sweet caramel note combined with a dry tart order characteristic of this yeast strain . the nose and after taste have a prominent floral flavor from the styrian goldings . the bitterness is mild overall . the finish is dry , tart and just a bit fruity .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : the lacing and head were lacking on this stout , which could be due to the duvel glass i 'm using for this tasting ( second beer with basically no head ) . anyways , when swirled vigorously , this beer consists of a caramel color that is still missing the thick lacing i desire . also , just like any good stout ... this beast is the blackest of black .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : medium brown murky body with absolutely no head on it . even with some vigorous swirls i could n't get any head to form . naturally , no lace or retention either . for being bourbon barrel aged i ca n't fault it too much as the barrel tends to kill some visuals , but it 's still not very attractive .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a burnt yellow color with some orangish tint . i have a lot of trub or yeast sediment in my glass . way to much for simple bottle conditioning . must have been left in there on purpose . i 'm not a fan ... i 'll try a more careful pour next time to see if it is just bottom sediment . the head is ample and bright white . lace sticks to the glass even as i 'm half way done .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : the head on this is spectacular ! this beer initially poured a deep dark burgundy with a couple finger of light tan head . the head then slowly collapsed on itself to form a very soft , dense , melted ice-cream film that left a solid sheet of lace around the whole glass . this is what a bsda should look like .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pretty much perfect for an impy stout . this beer is solid black until you thin the liquid to less than ~1/2 inch . a full glass looks like espresso . the head is tan , about a shade lighter than expected , and very creamy , sticking to the sides with ease .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : very clear pale yellow color with a nice white head . i love this color ( even if it is the same color as miller lite ) . the head eventually drops to a medium collar with a bubbly lacy patch in the middle .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear golden orange , with a smooth one finger white head that dissipates quickly and leaves little lacing . i like my big ipas to be hazier with a foamier head , so this did n't do much for me .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : not really muddy , but a dark burnt caramel . i think i 've made dulce de leche look like this when i 've overcooked it a lot . thin , persistent head ( at least the way i poured it ) .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the best feature of this beer . the beer pours a golden color with a picture perfect head . the topography of this beer is just tremendous .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a maroon brown with copper highlights at the edges . a bit cloudy , some small sediment particles even with an extremely careful pour . thin slightly off-white head , only a few millimeters , which goes down a bit a first but then lingers for quite a while .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : standard pour yields no head . beer is a muddy brown/clay . no lacing and minimal legs . a really sad looking beer .	00000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : crystal clear golden with a small quickly disappearing head	00000000000
1	a : more brown than an oktoberfest should be , little head	000000000000
1	a : eeeewwww ! what in the world is that smell ? it 's like rotten cheese sitting on top of some roasted malts and chocolate . plugging my nose as it take a sip ...	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear copper-amber , zero head or retention .	0000000000
1	appearance : the beer is a deep amber with a big and well sustained eggshell white head . there is a slight haze with some yeast or other particulate matter left in suspension .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : light amber , with little to no head , with bad retention .	000000000000000
1	a : bottle was a gusher , and foam geysered out even after some beer was poured out of the bottle . pours a hazy light orange with very active apparent carbonation and an enormous rocky head . foamy head follows beer all the way down the glass , and the head coats the side of the chalice . striking appearance .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : not the most carbonated beer . elevated pour barely yields a thin mocha film atop the brew that dissipates as quickly as it forms . beer is an opaque black . lacing is nearly non-existant with a spot here or there and little cling .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : brilliantly clear ruby red , completely still ; not a trace of carbonation .	0000000000000000
1	a : a deep golden/brown cloudy color looking alive and attractive .	000000000000
0	a : grainy , blueberry esters , and some faint hops . very fruity .	000000000000000

1	a : poured a deep black with a nice two finger mocha colored head . head had decent retention time resulting is a nice lacing .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy orange/caramel in color , not much head at all , and lots of sediment . thankfully i noticed this before dumping the entire bottle into my glass . however , this resulted in my having to pour at least an ounce of the beer down the drain because it was chock full 'o chunks .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the beer pours a dark golden color with a large white head which is 2 finger , and laces well ...	00000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear , dark maroon body that appears opaque in the center , with edge translucence , in slightly larger quantities . as the beer dwindles in my glass , it reveals its clear nature . it pours fairly still , as i would expect for something of this abv , though it maintains a very thin collar of tan bubbles .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : heavy pour shows a non-stop flow of carbonation . fat shaving cream head on top of a nice orange body . two seconds later , the head was dead as disco .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dark brown with a creamy tan head with some retention , a little bit cloudy flavor : highly complex malt flavor with undertones of lightly roasted malt , chocolate , slight hop flavor , slightly dry finish	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a deep reddish brown with a full finger of vanilla white head that leaves beautiful lacing .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured an apple juice gold with a head that dissipated very quickly to a very weak lacing . the color is nice though .	00000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : hazy orange topped by a healthy and frothy ivory head . recedes to a small layer of foam and leaves some ok lacing , but i 've definitely seen better from ipas .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : appearance certainly shows that this beer is aptly named . extraordinarily pale and yellow . almost unnatural looking with only a small amount of white head that dissipates quickly , leaving no lacing to speak of . really not much to look at .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : hazy orange , with absolutely zero head .	0000000000
0	a : pours a deep , reddish-brown . this stout was a lot thinner than i expected - not quite as viscous as other stouts . nor was this stout as dark as others and when i hold it up to the light the glass shimmers a very dark ruby red , but it is not opaque at all .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : served in a goblet , lovely golden color with a small head about a finger high .	0000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a dark brown 1/2 finger head which dissipates quickly leaving a slight lacing on the side of the glass .	00000000000000000000000
0	appearance : cloudy pineapple juice yellow , with pale orange hues . the head dissipated so fast i could n't see it 's color , i 'll assume it was white .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pitch black with a pillow-like head , this yeti expression looks promising in its tulip glass .	0000000000000000000
1	a : pours a cloudy light amber with a big , 3-4 finger thick bubbly white head . excellent retention and lacing .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : even before i begin to pour the beer out , white foam comes rushing out of the bottle . the head is so massive , that i ca n't really pour this beer into a glass . the color is a nice reddish/orange with gobs of chunky lace . the massive amounts of foam detracts from the appearance of this beer . obviously a beer should have a good amount of foam and lace , but i ca n't even try to pour the beer correctly .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pitch black with a creamy off-white head that left excellent lacing .	00000000000000
1	appearance : honey-golden . looks like a light version of guinness given the amazing falling carbonation . foam goes away a bit quicker than with guinness , otherwise i 'd give this a 5 .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : beautiful garnet color with a pale pink head . the head is pretty minimal , though on the second pour , i poured a lot harder and got about a finger 's worth . the head dissipates quickly my there is some lacing	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : really nothing going on here . dark , kind of reddish color , with almost no head . whatever head there is dissipates quickly and leaves no lace .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a dark ruby red in colour , bright and clear . head is a thin off-white lace .	00000000000000000000
0	a : pours a cloudy yellow , with a small white head not expected in a wheat beer .	0000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a copper color with orange and red highlights . a huge 6 '' head grows and is light gold in color . it shows excellent retention and leaves lots of foamy lace on the glass . the beer has no carbonation bubbles flowing to the surface .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : cloudy hazelnut brown with a beautiful creamy even head . lots of rising carbonation .	00000000000000000
0	appearance : a deep golden body , with a very active inch of head that has poor retention and does n't last . medium carbonation levels , but the overall presentation is n't great .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured abysmally dark , with about a two finger dark brown head that when it withered away , looked like sawdust on top of hardwood . the lacing was ridiculous !	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : if your gon na have a billy d williams colt 45 , out of a brown bagged 40 . actually , it was extremely bubbly , it was really impressive even though there was no head .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured into a bulb glass , copper to a lighter gold towards the edges , with a nice thumb-sized bright white head .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : bottle poured into a large snifter . the head is/was tan , gone in seconds to just a ring of tight bubbles around the glass . swirling leaves some lacing that falls quickly back into the beer . would n't say pitch black here , some dark brown is noticeable when held up to light . not really impressive looking .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the beer looks great- golden/straw color similar to la fin du monde . nice thick head that diminishes fast . already laced my glass after a few sips . cloudy , full of yeast which was visible on the bottom of the bottle . fizzy like a can of soda .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : say what you will about nitro beers : regardless , they pour out exceptionally beautifully . after a minute of settling , there 's a still a luscious , thick white head nearly an inch deep . rest of the beer is a dark , clear gold color .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : straw to light orange color with a nice thick head and lacing , very nice look .	0000000000000000000

1	a : pours deep dark and black . there is not a trace of light that shows through this beer . the head is like dark brown in color and a full inch thick . it settles down to about 1/2 '' and the retention is great . bold sheet lace left behind .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : fully hazed , bright orange body filled to the absolute brim - so no head . i like the obvious unfiltered-ness , but i like head more . this pour is disappointing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : head was thick initially , possibly due to the keg tap being overpumped . head very quickly disappeared . looks light yellow after head goes away .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dark yellowish close to golden	0000000
0	a : poured from a nip sized bottle into a snifter . completely opaque with no head .	000000000000000000

0	a : pours a murky amber under a small white head . no lace , no retention .	000000000000000000
1	appearance : the body has a very dark brown color with some lighter brown highlights . its head builds up thick and slowly settles down to thin cap that hangs on to the last sip . the head is tan in color and makes nice slippery lace that slowly slides down the glass as i drink .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured out a dingy , hazy straw yellow with a ridiculously big head of large white bubbles . leaves absolutely no lacing as the head falls to about a quarter inch thick .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured into tulip , way too light for a dopplebock . can see my hand on the other side of the glass . like a deep mahogany . nice tan head , good lace .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : medium golden color with a bit of haze . pours with a fairly large white head , although this soon disappears . a number of streams of carbonation rise quickly to the surface , but seem to do nothing to reinforce the head .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : deep caramel brown with a relatively anemic tan head that quickly fades to a thin layer leaving almost no lacing .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : let 's just say if i waited for the head on this beer to receed i 'd be writing this a week from now . incredible . looks like a well-done french souffle ' . carbonation almost cascades like a nitro-keg . usual nice rogue lacing along with a very dark colour and we have a fiver in this cat .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : reddish amber color , with golden fringing in the light . a very small head , as is to be expected from such a strong beer . bubbles struggle through the brew to the surface . swirling the glass leaves a nice thick coating , i 'm expecting this beer to be thick and creamy .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : poured into my pint glass , this brew pours as dark as the vampire 's soul with a dark tan , unrelenting , pillow like cloud of a head that leaves the best lacing i 've seen in a stout . without that lacing , this would be a 4.0 .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : perhaps an unfiltered beer , as the two bottles i sampled have lots of black floating specks visible when the ale is less than 1/4 inch remaining in the bottle . not too visually appealing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : poured opaque and thick with a three finger light caramel colored head . though the head is course , retention is excellent . upon dissipation , lacing along the glass is amazing . this is the type of lacing you only see in commercials of beer	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : looks pretty good . a clear , dark ruby , almost purple . the head is light brown without much retention . good looking beer i guess , but not for a belgian dark .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pour is a ruddy coppery color with a strong shade of ruby to it ; starts with a 1/2 finger light tan head that fades quickly to a thin , uneven and incomplete loose skim ; body is a little hazy , but still shows pretty strong carbonation bubbling up throughout ; a few scant spots of loose lacing are left behind .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours like oil . dark and viscous , like liquified obsidian . there is no head , it is like liquid black glass in my tulip . when swirled around the glass it leaves a light brown film on the surface . this is thick with blood red edges at the edges of the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : the bottle perfectly fills my snifter to the rim upon pouring . tp is a rich , espresso brown that lets just a glimmer of light through around the murky edges . a tan three-finger , frothy head sits atop . this brew looks great . it leaves a little lacing as the head falls to a mousse-like cream .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a thick syrupy brown liquid with lots of dark floaters . there no head to speak of , gee i wonder why . the color of the beer is a dark brown opaque mess . there is no clarity and there is a thick dark syrupy mess sticking to the snifter .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : it 's very rare for me to give a 5.0 appearance to a stout . when i look to review the appearance of a beer , i 'm usually looking for : 1 ) color or hue ; 2 ) clarity ; 3 ) carbonation levels , size , and distribution ; 4 ) head shade , density , and retention ; and 5 ) surface and side lacing and collar . it 's hard to get anything terribly useful in the first two categories out of a well-made stout - even if filtered , it 's likely going to be entirely opaque . so even when trying to rate to style , it 's tough for me to give a perfect 5.0 on appearance for a stout . and this beer is indeed black , absolutely opaque , even when held to most direct light . it may or may not be filtered and clear - it 's too opaque to tell . it gets a 5.0 overall though because it manages to get a 5.5/5.0 in the other three characteristics outlined above . the carbonation levels here are perfect , with thousands of fine , well-distributed , perfectly shaped bubbles rolling upwards and forming a mammoth bubble nest up underneath the head . the head is quintessential , picturesque . one finger or so high and a beautiful shade of mocha , it 's as dense , creamy , and sticky as you could imagine . fifteen minutes in and it has n't dropped more than a few tenths of an inch , slowly caving in in the center but leaving thick , solid , rocky sheets of lace clinging to the sides of the glass . which brings us to the lace , a crystalline lattice memorialized permanently along the sides of the tulip .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : poured from a 12oz can into a standard pint glass . pours honey and amber blonde with a thick and creamy head . the head dissipates fairly quick but leaves a nice cloud-like puff at the top of the glass . lacing is n't anything special but has decent cling . held up to the light , the brew radiates a little more golden with carbonation evident .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours a big fluffy 3+ finger medium-thick bright white head . medium to higher levels of carbonation evident that eventually mellows out . very opaque and the colour is a bright golden poppy or amber yellowish-orange . colour is very nice . head is pretty persistent . a thick cap stays the whole way down and leaves some nice lacing . i 've seen lots of weizen and this is probably the best looking one i 've ever seen . ca n't imagine it getting any better than this .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : deep ruby-bronze pour with a lush , frothy tan head that leaves creamy lace on everything it touches . pretty .	00000000000000000000000
0	appearance : coca cola brown with a lackluster mocha head and a lot of bubbles . subpar lacing . much of this is due to the aging i think .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : light copper color with maybe a centimeter head despite a pretty hard pour	000000000000000
1	a : beautiful orange-copper liquid . a bazillion parading bubbles marching to the top . a large fluffy tan head that eventually shrinks to a healthy beige film atop the liquid ... but only after oh , maybe 20 minutes . the head sticks around for a long time . the lacing is a testament to , well , lacing . the glass is lined top to bottom with perfectly defined rings that marked each time i put the glass down .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : cloudy yellow body with two fingers of fine , creamy white foam . nice retention and lacing . very attractive .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : jet black with a finger and a half of khaki colored head that dissipates slowly .	000000000000000000
0	a : pours a very pale murky straw yellow color with a struggling white head .	0000000000000000
1	a : cloudy dark amber , with more good lacing . the head was very minimal and dissipated quickly .	00000000000000000000
0	a : pours pale yellow with a firm , small white head , average retention , no lacing , fizzy .	000000000000000000000
1	a : pours like a flat dipa . i understand this is a pale ale late-hopped like a double . medium-cloudy brown . looks like a good carb profile .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours an opaque pitch-black with dark , mahogany highlights . 2-finger rocky tan head settles to a thin cap , leaving a nice amount of lacing on the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : overcarbonated ? sure seemed that way when it poured . solid amber with a tan , foamy 2-inch head . looks like a standard strong ale ( sans the crazy carbonation ) .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a golden amber , just on the verge of `` pale '' . head is a nice one finger , but short lived , and leaves little to no lace .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : clear orange in color with a nice 2 finger head . plenty of miniscule carbonation bubbles rising quickly to the top of the glass . the head lasts quite a while . thin paint-like lace develops through the drink .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a transparent abourn . an ominous sign .	0000000000
1	appearance : reddish-orange-gold color with a big , frothy white head on top . very good retention of the head but there was some uneven and pitted settling of the head that was kind of weird .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : hmm ... absolutely no head on this hard pour . a few dozen ( literally ) large bubbles appear , and even those look pretty pathetic . after a few minutes , they are gone . however , there are some bubbles sticking to the bottom of the glass . the beer itself is dark burgundy , with notes of brown . very dark , not at all transparent , and a little dull .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : it looks like piss . if memory serves , it was also presented in a plastic bottle .	00000000000000000000
0	a : pours golden orange , almost no head to speak of .	0000000000000
0	a : pours a cloudy , orange-chestnut body with poorly retaining off-white head .	00000000000000
1	appearance : cloudy yellow that looks like a fresh glass of lemonade head : big white head	00000000000000000
1	a : cloudy orange/dark amber with brownish tones . tiny , kind of foamy , head with some lacing .	00000000000000000000
1	appearance : i popped the cap , got my glass and then went into the other room to get my notepad , and by then the head in the bottle was slowly growing and pouring out onto the counter . i hate it when that happens . poured a clear , light amber with a very large , thick , pillowy , off-white head with good retention as it slowly diminished to chunks of head . good amount of thick lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : an odd light hazy straw yellow . it almost looked like lemon lime gatorade with a large white head . the color was awful , but i was impressed with the head retention and lacing all the way through .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a golden yellow , with medium head retention .	000000000000
1	appearance : severely dark with a mystical creamy tan 2.5 '' head that transitions into the body .	000000000000000000

0	a : straw yellow with about 1/2 a fingers worth of head that dissipates very quickly with no lacing at all .	0000000000000000000000
0	appearance : when i popped the cap , there was hardly any hiss whatsoever , and upon pouring this one into the glass , my fears were confirmed . a hard pour yields hardly any head , with no retention either . body is hazy copper-amber . flavor : again , the canned green peas are there again . i believe this is a combo between hop flavor and a possible dms issue . the beer has very strong bitterness for an ipa . not sure whether this is a batch issue or a brewer issue . based on the beers that i tried during my recent visit , i 'm definitely leaning toward a batch issue .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : red body , pink , fizzy head . brownish tint to the red body . no retention , no lacing -- too fizzy for either . excellent clarity .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours pitch , motor-oil black with an enormous tall brown thick head ; it 's so very thick , almost like hard whipped cream . slow dissipation leaves quite nice lacings .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : it poured a thick , frothy milk chocolate head that slowly died to a thick lace . it 's jet black with a thin amber brown hue .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : uhm ... no head . none . this poured a coarse , little head that vanished . the actual beer itself looks appetizing enough , but no head ? what the hell ? far too flat looking .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a clear pale golden color with lots of foamy suds and great lacing	0000000000000000
0	a : nice lager appearance with clear straw yellow hue	0000000000
1	a : an initial strong pour gives a 2-finger spongy , mocha-tan head , crackling softly as it drops to a denser , slightly rocky froth . this sits atop a deep , almost impenetrable ebony , tinged with a bit of garnet at the edges . second pour is even loftier , nearly 4 fingers of crackling head . terrific sticky/sudsy lacing . look , overall , is outstanding for me ...	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : piss yellow with a foamy head that does n't stick around .	00000000000000
1	a : poured a deep black with a nice brown head that just stayed there . looked amazing , even as i drank there was lots of bubbles	0000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : straw-colored golden . good head which dissipated fairly quickly .	000000000000
1	appearance : a creamy mocha crown acts as a barrier between the air and the absolute darkness of this beer .	000000000000000000000
1	a : certainly pours a red or deep amber ... sandy coloured head forms magnificently on top , with modest retention but a full on coat of lace left as a souvenir .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dark , murky brown , with a small , slightly tan head , with poor retention and no lacing . lots of sediment , with lots of floaties in the brew solution .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : amber in color , reddish tint , little carbonation and almost no head	000000000000000
1	appearance : clear golden with a killer head that has perhaps one of the best head retentions we have ever seen .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : body was cloudy and very pale yellow . a thin , white film sat on top and clung to the glass perimeter . streams of carbonation could be seen rising along the edges . very odd , but so is the style ( this was my first gose ) .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pretty scared opening this one . okay first it pours like motor oil very thick looking . color is a deep brown almost black color with little black specks floating all inside it . head was this thing supposed to be carbonated . it was nonexistent .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : clear , pale amber/straw color , weak soapy head with poor retention . medium carbonation .	000000000000000000
1	a : light yellow with a huge foamy white head .	00000000000
1	a : a nice amber color , maybe with more of a golden hue , with a nice head that laces well ...	00000000000000000000000
1	a : healthy pour yields a 1 finger semi-fine white head with decent retention . beer is a clear , pinkish-peach . lacing is ringed and patchy with decent stick .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a five finger head with an impressive upward bubble show that lasts about twenty seconds . lovely brilliant cream lacing and wonderful perfect thickness for a stout . soft and velvety appearance . retention is incredible as always ; the bottle did n't have a nitro-widget and does n't need one . dark ruby-black colour . highly appealing . sm : where to start ? cream , coffee , toffee , chocolate , roasted ( and thankfully unmalted ) barley , caramel , and assorted nutty hop hints . brilliantly complex and appealing , but not overbearing . relatively light strength .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear orange pour . small head at first , but quickly fizzles to nothing	0000000000000000

1	appearance : beautiful rubies translucent with a thick head that moderately disappears and a lace that lasts to the last drop flavor : toasty malt with light coffee low hop bitterness and moderated alcohol	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark to obsidian with dark tan head - one finger high . foam lacing lingers as you drink .	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : gorgeous dark colour with mahogony hi-lites . head pours like a rootbeer float , lasts quite some time and has excellent lacing . this head lasts forever .	000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : the beer pours a hazy pinkish-orange color with almost no head .	00000000000000
1	a : the pour of a guinness is a beautiful thing to watch . the way the head forms and the wonderful tan color of it . the beer is very dark almost black looking but small bits of light do manage to penetrate .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : slight chill haze with an orange-amber pour . there is a tall and super bubbly/foamy ivory head that settles very quickly and has absolutely no head retention and leaves no lace behind .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear , bright ruby color . no head . no lacing .	00000000000000
1	appearance : pours to a murky caramel-brown at first , then clears up to an amber-yellow . the head , however is simply fantastic . the widget creates a huge , thick and creamy light tan head that settles and retains a 2 finger froth that simply does not go away .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : black , a little quilt of dark mocha foam falls to a web on the surface . no lace . opaque .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : the appearance is really nice , it is a deep gold , with a long lived fluffy head and nice lacing .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a light amber tinged golden with a large , dense , bright white head that slowly faded into a very thick and fuzzy film that left streaks of lacing down the glass . carbonation looks very active .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : short to little , and completely no head retention . a light blonde , whiskey color .	0000000000000000000
1	a : crystal clear and light yellow in color , this beer is teeming with an even , methodical effervescence . the head is a finger thick , displays admirable staying power , and leaves a good amount of lacing on the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : the body pours a rich copper hue , with no head formation at the start and the slight amount of carbonation bubbles form a thin ring around the top of the glass , that holds on very slightly . the levels of carbonation in the body are very minimal .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours with an average head of 1 1/2 fingers , off-white in color , fizzy and rapidly diminishing . the body is light amber orange in color and is ridiculously clear . no lacing to speak of .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : thick misty gold , very exceptional here in finland . head left me unimpressed being only about a centimeter thick and disappeared quickly .	00000000000000000000000000

1	a : super deep black with a finger of tan head . some lacing .	000000000000000
0	a : well , after taking the cap off , foam oozed out the head of this for at least a minute before i stopped it . not off to a good start . when poured into my glass , calmly , i got about 1 cm of beer to ~7 fingers of head . the beer is a clear reddish brown and the head is light brown . after the head settled down , i had just over an inch of beer left in the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours out to nearly the clearest yellow i 've ever seen , even including light beers , with a thin wispy white head which disappears as quickly as is foamed up . it may be darker after i 've finished with it ...	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : ruby-brown-black , off-white head , initially a little lace , but no retention . perhaps due to the age of the bottle ? ( i think it may have been brewed in september ) .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : quite a darker shade of brown , the head was more subdued and was greyer , and had a few dusky chunks in there ...	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours an oily , tar-like impenetrable black with 1 finger of chestnut brown , fine-laced head that dissipates slowly . a nice thick layer of creamy lacing clings to the side of the glass and does not let go . extremely impressive ! n : espresso , rich toffee , molasses , roasted barley , bittersweet chocolate and hints of citrusy hops .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : yellowish-gold hue with a tantalizing layer of pure-white head ( creamy on top and spongey beneath ) , slight haziness , some varied-size bubbles rising quickly	0000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : thin lacing to start with shows that the head is deficient . bright brassy brownish amber gives off clarity .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : light yellow , golden !	0000000
0	a : a slightly hazy deep honey-amber . head is almost inexistant , and even with an aggressive pour , is very short and drops to all but nothing in no time .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : nice lighter orangey-amber color , with an inch of creamy head that recedes and leaves a good ring of lace throughout . i expected something a little lighter in color , possibly a darkish golden/straw color , and im pleasantly surprised by this appearance . i hope it tastes as good as it looks .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark brown , thin white foam rings the glass	00000000000
1	a : the pour is certainly fitting for the style . nearly black in color with an initially formbidable tan head that eventually settles down to a thin cap .	000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : it has a cola colored body with a reddish tint . the head is brow/tan that disappears quickly to form a thin line of lace . there is not much for lace just a little bubble island .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : breathtaking beer . pours a clear gold topped with a full three inches of rich , chunky white head - three times in a row . the head is so clingy that what sticks to the glass can hardly be called lace : it 's like half the head never goes away . the final pour from the bottle brings some cloudy yeastiness , but up until then the clarity left a great view of the carbonation rising steadily from the etched `` d '' on the bottom of the glass . epic .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark brown and is topped by a thin sheet of foam that sticks to the outer walls of the glass . one of the more enticing appearances of a pumpkin ale .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : burnt amber beer with a frothy two finger cappuccino colored head and excellent lacing .	00000000000000000

0	appearance : the body is a semi-transparent dark brown , with a golden tint , and a super-thin head that just rings the glass ever so slightly , leaving essentially no lacing	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a bright golden color with a rocky three-finger head that dissipated quickly .	0000000000000000
0	appearance : poured well , with no head to speak of , just some large bubbles that did n't stick around too long . color of apple cider . i must say at this point , i 'm a little dissapointed , as reviews i 've read mention a 1 to 2 finger white head . no head for me , story of my life .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours out a very hazy honey orange with glinting highlights of marigold yellow . slim white head of about half a finger rises and then slowly melts into the body of the beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : yeast specks detract from the experience .	000000000

0	a : very pale golden color with some good lacing .	00000000000
0	appearance : poured into a half liter weizen glass . i think this bottle was on the shelf a little too long . poured a clear , deep straw yellow , but i noticed a huge hunk of dark yeast at the bottom as i swirled the remainder . i managed to break it loose and pour it into the glass . after that the color darkened to a diarrhea dark yellow/brown , and larger pieces of the yeast settled to the bottom . surprisingly little head developed for a hefe . it does n't look very appetizing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a reddish amber color . a white head forms , but recedes to nothing in a second . no lace .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : bodacious carbonation produces a stunning whipped butter 2 inch head . the body is hazy , the color of rusy caramel . so far , so good .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : hazy amber pour with a sticky and sudsy off-white head that retains well . flavor : ick . corn-like sweetness followed by some earthy bitterness . onion-like flavors follow and more grassy hop notes . straw-like hops and fresh cut grass . balance is to the hops . finish is clean and dry . aftertaste is long and oniony .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : the beer is a very pale yellow color and as close to clear as ive ever seen in a beer , with a large white head that fades very quickly and leaves a spotty lace on the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : amber in color . clear with a good deal of active carbonation . a thin head quickly recedes leaving nary a cap nor a trace of lace .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the ale is a pale straw color that is absolutely the most brilliantly clear beer that i 've ever seen . it is a stunning beer to look at , to see the steady stream of carbonation . just beautiful .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : copper body under a good sized , puffy white head . excellent retention .	0000000000000000
0	a : served from a can , and let me tell ya , i got a kick out of the can . it has 2 bars at the bottom , to tell me not only when my beer is cold , but when its super cold , what ever the hell super cold is , also advertises its wide mouth , and a vent off the mouth that supposedly helps pouring . its kind of like miller lite with its vortex neck , if your beer tastes like swill you have to throw in some gimmicks . i talk of the can , cause there 's nothing to good to talk about the beer 's appearance . the head disappeared almost immediatley , no lacing , and overly bubbly . also a very pale yellow , almost like someone poured water into a beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured a sick yellow with minimal head . retained no head throughout the session .	00000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear , radiant orange-amber into a stein , with about a finger of fizzy head that dissipates rather quickly .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours from the can with a light golden colour , and with a loud fizzy effervescence . you could hear the fizz all the way from the other side of the room . the half inch head settled to nothing in under 30 seconds . the carbonation went flat by the time the beer was finished . ( less than 10 minutes ) .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a light amber color with thin head that dissipated very quickly	00000000000000
1	a : what always impresses me with the belgian ipas made in belgium is the head . nothing else comes close . it seperates and looks like a chunk of marshmallow is floating around in liquid marshmallow . the beer itself is a hazy golden color .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy yellow/gold , no head , no lace .	00000000000

0	a : well there is more than enough carbonation . the beer is a darker shade of amber and hazy . a thin but good head will remain on the beer after it largely subsides . there is good lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a nice clear red with a great deal of head that fades somewhat quickly . does leave behind some nice lacing .	0000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : very impressive . a big head seems to coat the glass all the way down . body is a brilliant hazy straw color with a neverending stream of bubbles rising to the top .	000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : jet black with brown creamy head . spotty/ layer lacing .	0000000000000
1	a : pours a rather dark burnt-orange with a billowing , dense and oily light tan head that took many minutes to collapse under its own weight into a thick and chunky mountain of foam . nearly a solid sheet of lacing was left down the glass as this butte of a head dissipated . this is a thing of beauty .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a light copper color with a fluffy white head that recedes to a thin head but leaves nice sticky lacing in its absence .	000000000000000000000000000

1	a : enorrmous chunky/fluffy white head , with great retention - almost 3 fingers high - there are very few beers that come close to this kind of rockiness . a hazy straw-colored golden with copious amounts of tiny carbonation .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : nice copper color , not very transparent . about a 1.5 finger very puffy off-white head with great retention . not very bubbly at all . however this has some of the best lacing i 've ever seen .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : very clear with a light gold colour . the head is white , large , frothy and presents a good retention .	000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : murky orange . head pours slightly off white and retreats quickly to the sides .	00000000000000000
1	a : light copper and mahogany , with a head that disappears to a couple clusters of big bubbles clinging to one side of the snifter . brilliantly clear .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a gorgeous , clear golden hue , with a big , frothy , foamy head , and possibly the stickiest lacing i 've ever seen . the lacing on the side of the glass is literally visibly three-dimensional , rigidly jumping off of the walls . scatters the light beautifully - just stunning .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a brownish-red color . it has a thin fizzy head that dissipates almost immediately and leaves no lacing at all .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : crystal clear bright golden color with a one-and-a-half finger foamy white head . visibly highly carbonated .	0000000000000000000
1	a : judgment day pours cola brown with a massive 5-finger head . held up to a light , some red streaks through , but otherwise the color is clear maple . jd 's tan head is both a blessing and a curse . because the carbonation is so high , it takes a 5-minute settling time and a repour to get a decent fill . then , the head forces more wait time to access the beer . however , the head is persistent , and moussy , and leaves giant globs of foam on glass . i can think of no beer that 's left this much head behind - cocoons of cream adorn the sides of glass , clinging on to the end .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : a reddish bronze color with a wispy head that disappeared quickly .	00000000000000
1	a : very light coloring , ridiculously large pillow on top that i have rarely seen on any other beer . added a lot to the experience of the beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : 1.5 finger head of slight cream , nice thickness , and good retention . colour is a hazy murky yellow-gold . sm : fresh sliced apple is very dominant and very luscious . maybe some spice is present as well . a strong scent , and a pleasant one . bravo .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a hazy copper-amber body with a couple of inches of fluffy foam . retention is impressively long ; over 5 minutes the head collapses in sections before leaving a thick island clump on top , which floats around as i drink . there is also a thick collar around the edges that leaves some beautiful lacing down the sides of the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : autumn brown/orange look with a patchy beige/orange head . carbonation rises to the surface in perfectly straight verticle lines on the side of the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : lightness personified , clear yellow , with a short , soon dead head , leaving only upwardly migrating bubbles , but nothing lasting on top .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : very dark brown . good head formation and nice retention .	0000000000000

0	a : dark brown . no head , just white foam along the edge of the glass . no lacing .	000000000000000000000
1	a : standard pour yields a 1.5 finger head coarse pink head with moderate retention . beer is a gorgeous crystal clear dark red satin . lacing is spotty but hangs out for longer than expected .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : very dark brn , fizzy minimal head	000000000
1	appearance : dark brown and relatively opaque . pours a 1-finger thick tan head that slowly dissipates into a healthy film . leaves some good lacing down the sides and looks good the whole way .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : almost no head on this one , poured about about a knuckle high and quickly died down to a thin film hovering over the beer . there is some substantial lacing , whatever is left of the head really sticks ! the beer poured a cloudy amber , looks like there is little activity going on as far as carbonation is concerned , but the color is very inviting .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : great looking brew ! golden orange with a big foamy white head that does n't want to ever go away , and leaves sticky lacing . constant show of bubbles continues throughout which keeps a good amount of head in tact the entire time .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a cloudy dark apricot-brown color . minimal off-white head for the first 10 seconds , but then it is gone and you can just see tons of carbonation at the surface .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : bloody red body which has a perfectly clear sheen . flamingo pink creamy head starts at 1 thick and settles to a more accommodating thick uniform cap . little to no sign of any carbonation but great looks nonetheless .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark brown with a small amount of head and not much lacing .	000000000000000

1	a : pours a dark cloudy reddish brown , with two fingers head- viewed from the top , my glass looks like a bowl of oatmeal . excellent lacing as well .	00000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : filtered golden color with a decent long lasting white head .	0000000000000

1	appearance : this beer 's party trick is in its appearance . most of it is standard to the style ; clear amber and a 1 and half finger head . with an aggressive pour i was able to generate a 1 and a half finger head that was foamy . the head dissipated slowly into an equally as frothy lacing . i have never seen the lacing of a mild pale ale cling to a glass like this . my glass was a mess of sticky lacing after i was done . an impressive appearance .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : perfection . pours completely clear with a thick pillowy head that sticks around for awhile . great carbonation level along with a perfect deep copper color . exactly what an ipa should look like .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : deep brown , with a touch of orange seen when held up to a bright light . two fingers of dense light tan foam , having decent retention . left extensive lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : i never really knew what an appearance of 1 would look like , but this is definitely that bad . most american macros have a warm yellow color even if they do n't have taste to back it up . this is the thinnest beer i 've ever seen - extremely pale not quite green , not quite yellow , not quite clear .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : tons of yeast . bottle-conditioned to the max ( literally ... there 's yeast on the cap ! ) . orange-brown , off-white head , some retention & lace .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a really neat cola ale with a single finger of light tan head which falls quickly to a centrally capped sheet of the same . little/no lacing . gotsta give some recognition here , man it 's brilliant , never seen a quad with this much clarity .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : exceptionally bright amber/gold with a dense pure white head with excellent retention . some light lacing .	0000000000000000000
0	a : pours a very much port like dark purple almost merlot color with a completely non-existent head . swirl this bad boy and you get some serious oily caramel colored residue on the glass . this guy has some amazing wine/alcohol legs to it -- thick and evenly spaced . again , is this a port or a beer ?	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a slightly translucent hazy orange with a creamy offwhite bubbly 1 '' head on the top . a picture of perfection .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : light golden in color , with hints of orange . one inch of foamy off-white head . thin lacing .	0000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours jet black with a 1/2 '' dark brown head . it dissipates quickly and leaves a murky surface above the beer . no laving remains .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a hazy , light golden color . head is moderate ; the pour unlocks a finger or less of foam , with short retention and little lacing down the glass . i do n't know if it 's an off bottle , but this and the lack of clarity are two dings . too bad the appearance is weighted so heavily .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear medium-amber body with a thin , faint , ephemeral off-white head ; decent lacing . might have been better-looking with a more vigorous pour , but pretty boring as-is . let 's hope the lack of a real head promises more intense hoppiness to come .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a dense , dark brown color with some chestnut hints . the head is quite large , foamy , and fluffy , with a light tan color . retention is very nice , with attractive lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : really nice looking brownish red color . poured with a finger of slightly off white head .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : arrives a transparent ruby-tinged brown with an opaque center and no head , very sedentary . a little unattractive , though the vivid mahogany around the edges of the glass is pleasant . a thin ring of foam ( and no ancillary lacing of any type - on the surface of the beer or the sides of the glass ) is all that remains of what i assume was once a head . not attractive , but understandable , given the style and the barrel aging .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : golden , slightly amber color . one and a half finger head fluffy white head . lots of lacing .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : perfectly clear deep ruby , edging toward brown . pours with a two-finger whitish head that lasts all the way down . perfect lacing . literally `` can not improve anymore '' .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : careful , decanting pour to prevent disturbing sediment as recommended on tag attached to bottle . slight chill-haze copper-amber body . weak , fizzy , off-white head that quickly fades to a small sustained edge ring . no lacing to speak of .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : viscous pour yields a .5 finger coarse , dark beise head with poor retention . beer is one of the only brown ales that i 've seen that 's actually brown . near opaque . lacing is sparse and spotty with little cling .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : nice head with good lacing . good balance of color and superb clarity . ruddy walnut color .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : clear medium golden color with a moderate snow-white head , which collapses to scattered islands of foam in less than a minute . lively fast-rising carbonation does little to sustain the head .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pouring a beer in the normal fashion yields little head , you end up with something that looks like a stadium pour . the only way to generate a head from this beer is to pour it down the middle which yields a 1 and a half finger head that dissipates all too rapidly . lacing is thin . the color is a reddish tinted amber . clear with a slight haze .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : slightly hazy light and pale wheat . the pour explodes with a huge head of white foam that overfills my glass , thought i had passed beer pouring 101 years ago ! yikes this resembles a washing machine with too much soap ! it just will not lay down	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : very dark body ( near black ) with a very disappointing non existent head ... no signs of lacing .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : pours an amber body with a small white head without much retention and lacing to speak up . head seemed to dissipate pretty quickly , leaving very minimal lacing as i drank the beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : murky orange yellow low carbonation and no head	0000000000
0	a : dark brown , almost black ; no light comes through , even on the edges . pored & lt ; 1/2 finger chocolate-colored head that dissipated quickly to a skim around the edge . laced in intermittent wavy rings .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : the bottle itself is intriguing with an interesting shape and stylish metallic label . from the pour there is very minimal white head , which results in a completely nonexistent lacing . the color of the beer is a light amber , almost a light reddish shade of gold .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a beautiful raspberry brown to copper with an amazing 3 finger crown that is slightly mocha with a hint of red . retention is strong and lace is everywhere . top notch looking fruit beer !	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a murky-as-hell amber with all variety of shit floating around in it . i think this might be unfiltered . head retention is excellent however .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a very dark brown with a reasonable amount of light coming through . there are three fingers of off white fluffy head and a good layer of head remains throughout .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a clear orange color with no head other than a few surface bubbles . no lacing develops .	000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear copper color with about a finger of white head that quickly recedes into a tiny ring with almost no lacing .	00000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : cloudy murky stray colored . no head . no lacing	000000000000
1	appearance : cracked the cap with a nice whoosh of carbonation . the beer pours an opaque jet black with a ton of carbonation . almost 3 fingers of mocha tan colored head that recedes slowly leaving a huge billowy layer along the top and great lacing down the edges of the glass . the liquid itself is amazingly dark . most oatmeal stouts let in some browns around the edges , but this one is all dark and mysterious . love it !	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : the pour looks like piss but with less carbonation : neon-yellow piss color with no head at all .	000000000000000000000
1	a : stunning shade of brownish-burgundy red ( machine gun metal rust , mudslides , fresh blood , `` cooked '' pinot noir , vintage port at its prime , sherry ) that positively glows like nothing else i have seen in a glass . a little fizz , no head , but no matter : nothing else is like this . n : strong hit of apple cider/red wine vinegar rounded off by slabs of oak and odd fruit ( plums , cherries , apples ) . honestly , it frightened me at first and i wondered if perhaps i had gotten a bad bottle , but then of course i realized it 's flanders red we 're talking about here . not wonderful , but not awful , but really free your mindset for this and you shall be rewarded . p/m : unlike anything else . immediate hit is oak drenched sourness , bordering on apple cider/red wine vinegar again but also with some strong sweet centrist flavors ( almost sugar sweet , but not quite as it gets swallowed up by the intense sourness ) . surrounding this vertical attack are bits of sweet fruit and just pure intensity , rounded off in the end by a long and slow burning finish of hot pepper , vinegar sourness , and a creaminess that is simply wild . smooth finish . this is hard to rate in terms of taste because it 's almost too intense in comparison to panil , yet more complex . i 'm impressed by the uniqueness of the style but this really is an epic journey into the most extreme netherworlds of beer . i could see how some folks would or could adore this . the after effects of drinking this left me a little shuddered and craving seltzer since all i could taste and feel was vinegar .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : served in a straight half-pint glass , it pours slightly hazy , copper colour , with an interestingly sparse white head reminiscent of some forcefully-poured plum or longan-fruit tea . not too impressive for a decent pint , that is .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a black cola color , very small head that dissipates rather quickly , zero lacing	000000000000000000
1	appearance : pale golden colour , visible carbonation , thin white head . last few drops from the 120z bottle were completely made up of sediment that mesmerizingly swam down to the bottom of my weizen glass . by the time it all settles , it was rather cloudy .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured into a snifter . gorgeous hazy apricot with about 1 finger of head .	00000000000000000
1	a : pours a beautiful dark amber color with a thick rocky light tan head . very clear with red highlights , very nice looking beer .	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the beer pours a dark amber color , almost copper with a finger of slightly off-white head .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : clear dark brown , almost black in color . no head forms even with vigorous pour . no lacing develops .	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a very clear amber color with a small amount of white head that goes away almost completely .	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a- , pours a dark amber/brown , the color resembling apple cider , with a one a half finger width cream colored head . very opaque appearance , even for a wheat ale . decent retention at first that thinned to almost nothing about 1/3 of the way down the glass . very slight lacing . appealing look , i was excited to drink this beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : well , pitch black of course . unbelievable head retention that is sitting at about one fingers worth so far . the head itself is a light brown/tan , hinting at some of that bourbon barrel effect . not really sure where a bourbon barrel stout could improve here .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : it 's the reddish-brown color of spiced rum . poor head retention .	000000000000000
1	a : a great looking beer . pale and crystal clear with a thick fluffy white head that left substantial lacing through the entire 30 min drink ...	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours with over three fingers of light tan head . this sticks around , only settling a small amount , and leaving some nice sticky lacing in its retreat . the lacing continues all down the glass as i drink , very nice ! the beer itself is a rich orange/copper color and perfectly clear .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark golden body with three fingers of white fluffy head . leaves loads of thick lacing and has great retention .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : hazy yellow-orange gold colour , with some small bubbles rising . the head is white , plentiful and quite creamy . very good head retention and wonderful lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear light-gold body under a finger of tight , creamy white head . good retention and lots of light lace . pretty great for a fizzy yellow beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clearish amber with a steady stream of small bubbles . a nice finger of head leaves behind nice lacing . a pretty beer , but nothing exceptional .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : damn . this beer is bubbling up like a champagne . it 's got a great golden color and a thick white head . the head almost seems like one of those `` phonies '' from the big breweries .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a scant 1 finger head of off-white bubbles sits above an orange , glowing body , very hazy .	000000000000000000000
1	a : pours semi-viscously with about a finger of creamy head with surprisingly retention . utterly opaque and almost black . good looking stout . ridiculous lace .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark chestnut body with a perfect mountainous tan head . excellent .	00000000000000
1	a : pours a very fizzy but somewhat aggressive head , that fades pretty quickly , but is quickly subdued by the huge number of bubbles rising from the etch at the bottom . the head is a messy bastard with lots of big bubbles , and pieces of head caught on the glass like dead bodies littering a war zone . the beer itself is brilliantly clear , a lot more than my fogged up glasses , and has a light tan straw pilsner like color . n : nose starts with a definite pilsner aroma , with some sweet malts , wheat , straw , sounds about right . a little bit of toasty malts , with some sweet crisp lager yeast aroma . however , there is a slight ... not skunked aroma , but a weird not so fresh aroma . i ca n't really describe it better , but whatever it is its very light . the nose in general is very light .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : it looked dark . really dark . nearly black body with just a thing white head . left behind thin white lacing as well .	000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a pallid straw-like color with a bashful head colored the purest of whites . retention is quite brief , as the head recedes into a meager ring around the top of the beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : maybe the best of the style i 've ever seen in a glass . huge and round and gorgeous looking white thick rings of lacing i keep having to stare at , for one . the head refuses to go beyond about 1/4 '' and the brew 's almost 3/4 of the way consumed . i do n't know if i poured this miraculously or what , but damn . not to mention the nice copper color and the myriad bubbles still cascading around in the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a deep brown , nearly black color with a 1/2 ' thick creamy brown head appearing at the top of the pour . no lacing on the sides of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : with that cascading effect , this one is prettier than guinness . eventually settled with a beautiful 2 finger dark tan head w/ good retention & lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : very nice dark brown/black color . nice brown head but faded quickly with little to no lacing .	00000000000000000000
0	a : a dark copper color with absolutely no head and no glass lacing . uh oh , this beer is dead flat .	000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a dark reddish color in the beer . there is a quarter inch tan ring around the glass , it has some retention . the clarity of the beer is slightly opaque with brownish garnet highlights .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : cola colored brown and reddish colored body with a creamy small-bubbled 1 '' beige head . carbonation climbs the sides of my glass . a consistent foam layer sits on top along with clingy lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark-golden pilsner color , nicely spritzy .	000000000
0	a : nice redish brown with a light tan head . the head is fed for a qhile from the carbonation . the beer looks nice except it seems to look dirty . either this is an unfiltered offering , which i doubt or it seems to have specs of things clinging to the glass as carbonation bubbles past . do n't inspect closely for a good looking beer . s and	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : bright yellow , little head disapear quickly with some lacing , high carbonation .	0000000000000000
0	a : pours a dark maroon body with a smattering of tan bubbles on top of the beer .	0000000000000000000
1	appearance : glowing amber with quite a bit of haziness . the head does n't rise very high , but retains nicely .	00000000000000000000000
0	appearance : nice reddish/tan color with a good froathy head .	00000000000
0	a : you do n't need me to describe it . you can see what it looks like in the bottle . suffice to say it 's not very appealing .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a medium orange with an impressive white nitro head , thick lace .	0000000000000000
1	a : far and away the most impressive aspect of this beer . the head was huge ! ( 3 fingers ) , frothy and mountainous . and it lasted forever . i was left with a rocky island of head in the middle of my glass . super sticky . the lacing was so impressive that i actually felt bad rinsing out the intricate design left behind . it was remarkably consistent . the body was clear and sparkling , half way in between yellow & copper . s &	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a nice golden/ amber color with a small white frothy head .	00000000000000
0	a : it pours a clear and almost glowing orange color with no head .	000000000000000
1	a : very pretty nitro pour . thick , cascading , creamy looking head atop a dark brown body .	00000000000000000000
1	a : black as night . it could possibly have the highest lovibond i have seen , true black . the head was also incredibly dark and unwaivering . it was the color of some chocolate milk on steroids , and the head retained intself the entire time . i was amazed that a beer at 17.5 % abv could have that kind of head retention .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : very inviting brown amber color with purple hues . i do n't think i 've seen such a color . thick creamy lacing with awesome retention and tons of lacing . near perfection . 4.0	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours light golden with a large white airy head that sets into decent lacings .	00000000000000000
0	appearance : dark yellow/orange with a large amount of yeast suspended in the beer and at the bottom of the glass . small this white/beige foamy head that lasted throughout drinking . small amount of lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark black with a tan head with a nice cascade as the head builds up to the rim of the glass then lingers for the rest of the session . i swear the head stayed the same size the entire way through . that 's about where the good things stop happening .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : as it was poured slowly , there was virtually no head and what there was dissipated very quickly , just the way i like it . however , the colour of the beer was more reminiscent of urine than anything else . i had the distinct feeling that i was drinking carbonated piss water as i downed this brew . not a very good conception .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours black , with no highlights . half-inch beige head which completely disappeared before i took the first sip .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : tawny on the pour with a glass engulfing rigid foam head of & gt ; 50 % occupancy that was beige in color and lapsed at glacier speed leaving a generous amount of speckled delight after much time and patience . im guessing this either suffers from infection or came compliments of a belgian yeast strain . either way a spectacular lacing and had gives this an extra umph in the visual appeal department .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : after peeling of the top of this can ( yeah , peel top , like a can of soup ) , i immediately had worries strewn about . i poured it and then was reminded of a jacuzzi . the head steadily rose for a while , then dissipated all in one go . it is quite clear , and suds are pouring out from every edge of the glass . unusually sudsy . i wonder if the color was injected , because everything else seems synthetic so far .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : every pour is a tsunami of a head . nothing backs down . tons of rain forest and windshield lacing . hazy darker copper amber body . have n't seen retention or a head this good , first pour or last , on any esb , ever .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : medium-dark copper body disappointingly topped with1/4 finger collar of foam which dissipated within 30 '' .	000000000000000000
1	a : pours a light brown with a remarkably long lasting head , amazing .	000000000000000
0	appearance : dark chocolate brown in color , kinda murky . two fingers of foamy ivory/dirty white head that dissipates down to about half a finger and lingers	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark mahogany brown , with a full white/tan head which makes it really inviting , poured into a chimay chalice .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : the bottom of the glass has the look of a cloudy dark tan . this gets darker the closer to the top of the glass in which it turns to a brown . the first glass had a lot of carbonation which can be seen . caused for a giant head , of a light tan that looks almost white , with each pour .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : nice deep brown/amber color with a superior head ( basically got an 8 oz bottle and the foam filled the rest of the 12 oz glass ) .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a straight , unhurried pour yields a clear dark-brown , effectively black , body under a lovely three-finger head of creamy , mocha-colored foam . great retention , tons of lace . gorgeous stout , plain and simple .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : orange-brown , pours with a rediculous amount of creamy , off-white head . lots of head retention , leaves a nice lace . who could ask for more ?	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : rich and dark with a beautiful , thick head at pour . head disappears rather quickly , however , and there 's no lacing to speak of , so it loses a few points here .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : watery , light yellow .	0000000
0	a : pours orange with a very limited head . wisp of carbonation , but mostly just gloopy bubbles .	00000000000000000000
1	a : crystal clear copper with tiny bubbles fighting for surface supremacy . lots of thick creamy head that leaves a spackling of lacing all the way down to the last drop .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very hazy - like unfiltered honey - same golden amber . deep and bitter . the malts are complex ; sweet like brown sugar and burnt . hops are very present . very grassy and mildly lemony . the alcohol is noticeable , but not over-powering . feel is lively .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured into a duvel sniffter ; black as night with an overflowing dense mocha head . excellent retention with a ridiculous smooth layer of lacing as it 's being enjoyed .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a beautiful , hazy reddish-copper with a thick , beige head that fades to a film leaving heavy but patchy lace on the inside of the glass . i really love the color .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours jet black with a rocky tan head . very good retention , and overall , a great looking porter .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy dark golden . 1/4 '' head that quickly fades . minimal lacing .	0000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear amber with an intense forming bubbly head , which then disappears into nothing . extreme carbonation .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a cloudy , milky straw-colored body capped with a foamy , off-white head . this looks like a standard hefeweizen . i absolutely love the milky , unfiltered look for this style , and this one is no different . only the head fails to retain well , so i 'm a little disappointed .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this was a hazy coppery color with golden , peachy highlights . it poured with a big , sticky , off-white head that lasted quite a while .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : absolutely impenetrable black , no highlights or edges when held to a lamp . just incredibly thick looking . would be a 4 or higher if it were n't completely flat . no head , no lace , nothing . yeah , it captures the color , but that 's not really too hard .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours murky brown in the glass . it 's amply carbonated , with a good cap that remains for the duration of the drink . the bottle is a slow gusher . sigh .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours into a pint glass ... as pale as can be , clear , watery straw color , light white foam head with little retention ... completely unappealing	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : ultra clear medium orange color . two fingers of frothy head with excellent retention and good lacing . 3.0	000000000000000000000
0	a : golden opaque	0000
0	appearance : pale golden color with a finger or two of rapidly dissipating light foam head . not great . this style of beer really needs a head .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : ok carbonation ; purplish black ( like a porter ) ; no head	000000000000000
1	appearance : a finger and a half of creamy head the stuck around and produced some lacing does it favours . as does a crystal clear body that defines the word amber . slow steady carbonation gives it an almost regal look . more lace and more retention and it would have got the perfect score .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very dark brown , with a tinge of cranberry color beaming through the beer . small but vigorous head only climbs to less than an inch and subsides quickly . the head is tan with a small bit of lace left on the sides of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : golden amber hue with a head that dissipates too quickly for my liking .	0000000000000000
0	a : super pale yellow brew with almost no head at all ( pure white ) . the head has almost no retention with absolutely no lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dirty amber-brown brew with minimal lacing .	000000000
1	a : literally the thickest head i 've ever seen , four fingers , and takes forever to die down leaving behind streaks of soapy lace .	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear but not crystal , amber colored , nice frothy one finger head is slow to dissipate , with great retention and huge rings of lace to recommend it .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours into my delirium tulip pitch black with a mocha brown head . it starts at a finger 's height and barely shrinks down at all . phenomenal .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a one finger head of poor cream but fair thickness and retention . colour is a clear yellow . there was a brief bubble show . sm : a bit o ' cream , barley , some nutty hops . a moderate strength aroma .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : nice head on this beer that retained it 's lacing quite well . poured out into a nice cloudy chestnut brown .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : standard pour yields a 1 finger slightly off-white semi-fine head with good retention . beer is a clear reddish-copper . lacing is thin but with great patterns and stick .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured from bottle to pint glass . not much head goin on here . very average appearence , but who really cares .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : beautiful 2 finger off white head . medium-dark amber color with some ruby-red tones as well . excellent head retention and excellent lacing .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : evenly hazy copper color . poured a 3 finger rocky off-white head with excellent retention to a 2 finger cap . decanted lightly . laced in rings with legs extending down the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : black , finger of light cream foam falls to a broken sheet .	000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a medium brown body with a prodigious head that leaves wafts of lacing all over the place	00000000000000000000
1	a : standard pour creates a 2.5 finger fine , fluffy , white head with moderate retention . brew itself is a semi-clear orange tangerine color . lacing is ample , web-like and almost creates a waterfall effect with massive outlines of bubbles . a real pretty beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : an amber/red pour . head is a little lacking , and leaves just a trim of lacing .	00000000000000000000
1	a : the head on this thing is crazy huge . it 's tan and creamy like the head of a rootbeer float poured directly over ice cream . the beer itself is black and very dark brown at the bottom of the glass . lacing is immense , and does not back down while drinking .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : body is brownish red ( mahogany ) , bright , and clear ( need to hold it to light ) . a ring of khaki-colored foam sits on top and drags a bit of lacing . i 'd actually like to see something a bit murkier/more mysterious , but it looks pretty nice overall .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy , orange amber , not much head at all . i guess you could say that the cloudiness is consistent with the base beer being a wheat , but it is a bit dull and muddy	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : same as the normal hefe as far as head pour and retention . pours like a champ and then it disappears . no lace no residue . it is `` dunkel '' meaning dark . it is brown and cloudy and highly carbonated .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : cloudy golden to straw color . cakey smooth white and sticky head , with moderate levels of lace .	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : into a deus flute . pours with a vigorous rush of carbonation and foam . light straw and perfectly clear with a nice frothy head and patches of lace . constant carbonation rising to the top .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : clear and golden with a minimal amount of carbonation . i got just about no sign of a head and absolutely no lacing . really quite disappointed with the appearance of this beer . i was hoping for something spectacular being that it is supposed to be the real king of beers .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pure clear lemon juice with a huge paper white head . ridiculous lacing . 5/5	00000000000000000
0	a : holy hell is this an ugly beer . incredibly turbid and not even brown , we 'll call it a mahogany color , with almost no head .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dark orange body filled with haze that poured from the bottom of the bottle . almost no head .	000000000000000000000
0	a : golden straw hue lends itself well to the body , with a 2cm chalk head that reduced to half a centimeter . nothing special .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a translucent yellowish-golden color with a tiny head that disappeared before i could walk 15 feet from my kitchen to my couch . i looked but could not even find a hint of lacing . .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a bright , slightly opaque golden with a large birch-bark coloured head . bubbles make the voyage from the bottom to the top of the glass with regularity . some floaties .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : copper-pumpkin in color , average lacing , little head .	000000000000
0	appearance : the bottle opens with a minimal `` pffft '' of released air . after a vigorous pour , there are some sudsy , rather unattractive bubbles surrounding thin clouds of foam on the surface . the color is straw gold with a hint of orange , and it is quite hazy . when i tilt the beer up on the walls of the glass it looks moderately viscous and leaves bits of sticky foam behind . this one really is n't much to look at , but i 'm thinking there might be plenty to enjoy in the aroma ...	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark and murky reddish/brown color . a minimal brown head forms , and sticks around as a ring . very little lace is left behind .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : soda like head that dissipated instantly . with an apple cider color and what appears to be a high carbonation this looks more like sparkling cider then a beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : amber color , orange almost . the brew looks amazing , exactly what i expect a pumpkin ale to look like . reminds me of october already !	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : deep opal or opaque . clear with ruby highlights when put up to the light . a creamy off white head retention . flavor : sweet up front then a burst of chocolate and roasted flavors that finishes with a light bitterness . hints of licorice .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : slightly hazy orange body that supports a thick , frothy head ...	00000000000000
0	appearance : the alaskan ipa pours an extremely clear , almost disturbingly clear , pale yellow color . it looks more like an adjunct lager than an ipa . the head , however , is big and fluffy , close to two fingers . it dissipates very quickly though and without much lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours into my unibroue tulip a vaguely hazy bright orange gold with hints of red . the off-white head is huge and loose-bubbled and drops to a very solid cap . lacing comes in a few splotchy sheets .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : crystal clear , little white head .	000000000

0	appearance : light straw yellow . almost no head formatio and no lace retention .	000000000000000
0	appearance : pale golden color . after a hard pour , the head fizzed and disappeared the same way a diet coke 's foam does . not appetizing at all .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : the beer pours a dead black . there is no opaqueness to light . the head is nearly three fingers high with a creamed coffee coloration . the head seemed to last forever . the lacing was like pancake batter on the side of my glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pale golden yellow color , a little hazy , not some carbonation that dissipates somewhat quickly .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : nice looking flip top blue bottle . pours a dark brown color with only a spot or two of surface foam . no lacing develops during the session .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : great amber/orange color , but a short lived white head didnt lace . flavor : nice malt accent with some mild fruit cup tastes . some hints of chocolate , nuts and yeast . a mild alcohol taste comes in as it warms , but melds nicely with the beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : finger and a half of slightly off white head on top of a lighter copper body . the beer is totally clear with lacing . the head just does not go away .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : i will be blunt , it 's piss yellow with a wack of fizz and a thin white head .	0000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a glowing orange color with peachy-sunset red tints . a beige head that had nearly all but disappeared by the time the beer arrived . the head eventually rested and stayed as a thin covering . the lack of a head spoils the looks to be honest . half-way down the drink , with no lacing , the beer looked sadly flat and unappealing at times .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours a clear dark chestnut color with a very stiff looking 1/8 head of tannish foam . there dont appear to be many bubbles rising to maintain the head , but the thickness of it lets it remain a thin layer across the top of the beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : not much of a head generated . it 's pretty easy to see through this beer .	0000000000000000000
1	a : two fingers of incredibly dark head . jet black about 98 % of the brew 's volume . thick appearance , if that makes sense . great lacing , and the dark brown head retains as a thick cap and ring .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a frothy , medium brown head of 1 finger goes quickly . the body is completely black and nothing can be seen through the other side of the glass . as the drinking continues , half sheets of lace are stuck behind . not bad , but a very standard appearance . s &	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : slightly hazy , pale golden color with less than one finger of diminishing white foam head . heavy lacing remains on the glass . a few bubbles are observed to rise in the column while tiny floaties are plentiful , hanging motionless .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this poured quite an interesting head , the head was thickly carbonated with over 4 fingers in size . this poured black , but it seemed almost like a black molasses color . laces quite amazingly .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : cloudy amber/orange with a large head that laces down the glass to the last drop . perfect	0000000000000000000
0	a : deep gold color with good clarity and and very active carbonation . white head starts out firm , but quickly disappears .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy brown with some sediment suspended in the beer . thin off-white colored head .	00000000000000000
1	appearance : shimmering off white lace that leaves a web-like trail , the pancake of a head stays for a while floating above the bright golden liquid .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : blue , very blue	000000
0	a : pours an oh-so-clear honey golden color . head started off a big fluffy white pillow , but is now a scant layer of suds . zero lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : just about as good as a beer can get . dark golden amber color , almost brown ... looks gorgeous . moderate amount of carbonation bubbles rising and sticking to the sides of the glass . head is creamy light tan with lacing down the glass . looks great .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : light coloring for a fest beer and the head was thin and lifeless .	0000000000000000
1	a : beautiful golden hue to the body and a soft white head on top . good lacing . heck , even the label is nice with its cheerful , springy colors .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours jet black with a mahogany tinge around the edges . very minimal head that is quickly reduced to nothing . thick film clings to the glass leaving behind some webbed lacing . n : excellent bourbon and vanilla notes waft up right away . there 's also rich dark chocolate , roasted barley , toffee , light booze and some nuttiness ( pecans ? ) .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : nothing at all to get excited by , a murky bread-crust amber with a brief and quick-dying head . decent carbonation a few streams of small bubbliness up to ... nothing . zero lace .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : remarkably un-cloudy for a wheat ale ? the body was a lightly hazy honey gold/orange , topped by a foamy 2-finger head of an eggshell color which fades pretty quickly . lots of carbonation bubbles rise to the top , but there is only decent lacing left behind . meh .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours thick and black looking with a small head of tan bubbles after a pretty aggressive pour . the head faded while i was typing my notes , so it was gone within 20 seconds or so . the beer looks a bit like coffee sitting in my glass with no foam or anything .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : a finger and a half of head but it disappears very quickly and leaves a light ring around the glass . pale yellow color like most adjunct beers .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : color is right with a deep brown almost black that when held to the light shows a ruby hint . the head is way too thin and fizzles out quickly . the color is not enough to compensate for the pathetic head . s/t : clearly cocoa and roast grain in both nose and palate . neither flavor is overpowering . i like it but do n't think it has the complexity to rank among the best stouts .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : orange , very cloudy ( more than what would be expected from a dry hopped beer ) , no head . like a flat hefe a sweet citrusy , spicy aroma .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : clear amber pour with sudsy white head . still looking in the glass . flavor : more malt driven character that reminds me of wheat bread , buckwheat pancakes , and dark grain flavors . balance is nearly even with a slight lean towards the malt . finish is clean and dry .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : fantastic . a lovely clear amber that takes on an unexpected pinkish hue in the light . reminiscent of a sunset at sea . a finger of head devolves into multi-bubbled patterns . great lacing . top-notch .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : black as night ... the folks from the brewery were n't lying when they said that there 's literally no light coming through this one . really thin khaki head that disappears quickly , leaving just a tiny bit of lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a clear straw-golden body . it 's fizzy , with ample carbonation up the glass , but it never develops a huge head . good retention , with some spots of lacing down the glass . i expected much more carbonation and lacing from a belgian pale .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pitch black , no light can be seen through this beer . chocolate shake like head in the beginning , but it dissipated very quickly . no head retention at all .	0000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : not a sound as the cork comes out . pours pitch black and completely flat . this gets a 2.0 because it 's a pretty big fuck you to not carbonate a $ 35 bottle .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : beautiful brown color , crystal clear with a nice tan creamy dense head . medium lacing .	0000000000000000000

1	appearance : wow ! this is one of the prettiest beers ive ever poured . the body is almost as dark as burnished copper ( i think darker even than dreadnaught ) with lovely , rustic , fine flakes in an almost colloidal suspension , lending the beer a thick , cloudy appearance . floating on top of this liquid was a rich , beige , ultra-fine-grained , whipped egg-white head that left a solid , continuous sheath down the glass . tiny bubbles seemed like seed-pearls embedded in amber .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : hazy bronze/light copper color . sediment chunks contradict the purported filtering . i do n't mind the haze and chunkage so much , but why call it filtered ? voluminous head is persistent .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : the beer poured clear amber in color and has lacy patterns of bubbles floating on the surface .	00000000000000000000

1	a : 3 months old . gentle pour to retain yeast leaves little ring of white head . straw amber liquid is slightly hazy . i 'd like better head or no sediment so i can pour more aggressively .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : i drank from the can but could see the pale ting of golden color that is more likely an artifact of artificial food coloring than a product of grains and hops .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : this beer poured a cloudy orange/pumpkin color . it was also totally flat . probably the worst looking beer i 've poured . was thinking it may be a drain pour .	0000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : an extended pour yields a 1 finger creamy white head with moderate retention . beer is a clear tangerine sunrise . lacing is spotty and stringy with little stick . lack of head retention and lace really hurts appearance in this style .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : in a goblet it pours a dark orange or dark amber colour , with a fast-disappearing head and minimum carbonation ; looking just normal , a bit lack of character for a bottled ale .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : this is n't the best looking pour of guinness i have seen , but even so , it 's a pretty sight . the beer is dark brown , bordering on black . the head is thick , creamy and leaves a thick sheet of lacing around the perimeter of the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : typical slight dark amber bock color . this got me excited . low head quickly dissipates , also typical for a bock .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a very dark mahogany with a bit of an almost purple hue . pours with one of the most massively billowing heads i 've seen and it stays up for a long , long time , leaving thick lacing in its wake .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : poured with a large fizzy light tan head that dissipated quickly to a thin layer leaving no lacing on the glass . the beer is clear with a reddish/orange brown color .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : opaque and jet black in my glass with a short , caramel colored head . on close inspection , the beer is actually a clear , deep amber brown .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : beautiful black with a thick brown head that does n't dissipate easily .	000000000000000
1	a : the look is a stunner ; so dark it appears 'black ' at first glance . closer inspection showsdeep , alluring mocha with traces of glowing ruby . head is a thick mound of tan meringue , taking over 5 minutes to drop from its 2-finger apex to a thin coating sheet . lace is strong , a webwork of sponge-like blots .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : no head . at all . there 's a tan colour floater . it 's lovely for what is present . the abv is taking its toll . colour is a solid black . sm : a strong aroma of rich chocolate , cocoa , vanilla , caramel , alcohol , and slight esters . a strong aroma .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : retention and lacing are , of course , wonderful . the beer is an ever so slightly hazy golden/orange . the part of the pour that is actually liquid looks nice . brownish specks come out at the end of the pour ; ca n't be sure if they 're yeast or something less pleasant .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a two finger head of slight cream , decent thickness , and alright retention . colour is a cloudy dark orange . not real appealing , truth be told . sm : aroma is light in strength . dirty orange esters dominate . no cream is present .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a dark brown body with a creamy , off-white head .	00000000000000
1	appearance : a deep , dark ruddy brown body with garnet and ruby hues , hints of orange around the periphery even , a truly gorgeous , foamy tan head - seriously , i had to ask if this was on nitro-tap , it 's so immaculate and immobile and meringue-like - with great retention that leaves huge three-dimensional lacing . an amazing-looking beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : clear brownish amber with a finger sized head that disappears into nothingness . a good bock should have a good sized off white head that lasts .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : very light colored lager , akin to a macro-adjunct lager . foam ? lacing ? hello ? i guess nobody 's home .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a deep brown with nice ruby hues when back lit . 1 1/2 fingers of beautiful light toffee head forms tight and remains that way for the entire slow descent . a nice fluffy skim remains at the end . great blanketing and ringed lacing throughout .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : golden with a chill haze . extremely thin white lace .	0000000000000
0	a : ugh . almost watered down looking . a very , very , very weak straw with no head after 2 minutes .	000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a little darker than most pilsners , but still golden in hue . heavy carbonation from the bottle supports a thick , pillow head the color of sand . slightly hazy on the pour , more akin to a hefe than a pils , so i took some off . good lacing effects .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : i dunno . i love the appearance of golden body in contrast to the white , gold , and red of the label .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : the appearance of this beer is just perfect for a nut brown . it is a deep , rich mahogany brown/ copper with a decent half inch head that lingers for quite a while .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pitch black body with an almost none existent head , there are just a few large tan bubbles and that 's it . the carbonation is minimal .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a brillant clear , golden body , allowing one to see some visible carbonation . i do n't know if it was the waitress ' fault ( both times ) , but no head except a small white ring around the edge of the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : nice garnet color with an orange-ish head that holds up well . this beer is very clear .	00000000000000000000
1	appearance : pitch black with a thick mousse-like brown head . excellent head retention , an all-around decent looking beer .	000000000000000000000
1	a : pours what looks like a hazy woody brown , but when held to the light is actually a hazy , almost opaque blood orange with two fingers of persistent , fluffy tan head . large carbonation bubbles make themselves seen fairly obviously as they float to the top of the glass and keep the head strong . the bubbles almost look as if they 're suspended in a gel , not in the way they move , but in the way they stand out against the hazy translucent brew . there 's a bit of lacing as it 's drunk , and the combination of that and the head is very impressive for such a high abv . the carbonation 's appearance is honestly what impresses me the most , however .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours a hazy russet body with a prodigious head that provides loads of splashy lacing	00000000000000000
0	a : color is a pale yellow with a light gold tint , very much like urine . there is a touch of cloudiness . head was a solid two inches , compact , bright white . slowly disippated , leaving foamy lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : bright with a straw colour . the head is white , medium-sized , frothy and fades rather quickly .	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a golden-copper , hazy at first but clears pretty quickly . two fingers of white head with decent retention . tons of lacing . slightly darker then i expected for a dipa .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pale , pale , oh so pale . one of the palest brews i have come across . bubbles floated from the bottom of the glass almost through the entire 12 oz .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a fairly assertive pour yields a perfect two-finger head of dense tan foam atop a crystal-clear garnet body . terrific retention and some soft lacing . gorgeous beer , plain and simple .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours copper with a 3-finger fluffy as a cloud off-white head . lacing in patchy clumps . head retention is pretty good , seems to be staying around . beer is absolutely and completely translucent . plenty of carbonation bubbles can be seen floating to the top .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : quite dark and black , cola brown gets let in at the edges . the head is a dark tan , but this dies back to a think ring which eventually goes away completely . not much in the way of lacing either . not much to look at for a belgian strong dark ale .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : i honestly thought this is one of the best looking beers i 've poured . pours a very dark brown/amber ( almost black ) that has a small mocha head at first that dissipates quickly , but leaves a nice , creamy , `` puddle '' in the middle and to the sides .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a boring yellow-brown , clear , with almost no head at all .	0000000000000000
0	appearance : poured a clear , piss-colored yellow ( this really is the most accurate description of the color ) . a two finger head that quickly dissipates into soapy suds . boo	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : like the look so far , crystal clear if the crystal were a shade of amber . could stand to be a little darker , but the head is where it needs to be , looks sticky and is leaving some lace behind without me even taking a sip yet .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very pale amber , with little head and no lacing . pretty light in color for the style .	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : great black color , no light gets through at all . large , dark tan head which forebodes the taste to come !	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : this is probably the ugliest looking beer . yellow , with a cloudy suspension to it . sorry , it really looks like urine to me . but than again , i weight appearance much less than the other categories .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : black as night . thin brown head that dissipated into nothingness quickly . zero lacing .	000000000000000000
1	a : what a good looking beer ! two fingers of a fluffy cream-colored head sit atop a orange-red haze . the color of this red ale is perfect and a little light will bring out some beautiful highlights . as the head recedes , the foam remains stuck to the side of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : it 's a nitro-poured guinness . how much `` prettier '' does it get ? a head that never quits , classic cascade , liquid black as coal ; i ca n't ask for more as far as looks .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a full 2+ finger head . a murky brown color .	00000000000000
0	a : pours a deep black with dark ruby highlights and a vigorus pour barely yielded the smallest head and it quickly faded to a ring with a tiny bit of lacing . when i pulled the cork out there was no pop or anything and given lost abbey 's reputation i was n't that surprised .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this is a hallmark of this beer : the soapy , lingering suds of the head stay there for a long time after poruing and there are also legs of foam that build up as you drink . color is a deep amber , with orange highlights on the rims . almost a browness core to it .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : standard pour yields a coarse ring of white bubbles atop a cloudy , light silt-colored beer . rather small legs with some spotty lacing with moderate to low retention . not the most attractive beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a big white frothy head with excellent lacing that followed . brilliant looking deepstraw/gold color and very appealing .	000000000000000000000

0	appearance : amberish ... like a dark unfiltered apple cider , almost non-existent off white head , looks viscous flavor : malty ... bread , nuttiness , and some citrus notes . too sweet for a true triple , almost boarding on a barleywine like flavor with belgian yeast	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : cinnamon brown , no head , no lace . uh oh !	00000000000000
1	appearance : very deep and dark reddish amber color with a massive , offwhite and foamy head with good retention , that left lots of lace .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : looks more like apple juice . barely any bubbles , almost no head that dissipated extremely quick . it is a nice yellow in color though for a pale .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : quite a bit of sediment on the bottom tried to leave most in the bottle . pour a nice black color . the head dissapoints ... there is none .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pale amber , not as dark orange as some . nice 1 '' head , medium bubbles and moderate retention . some lacing .	00000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : slow motion gusher as i took the cap . lava lamp coagulation is disappointing as i am in the age range suggested by the label , if at the tail end of it . im patiently waiting and most of it is settling toward the bottom of my glass . hazy deep brown with a skimpy cover of tiny light tan bubbles but a good collar flavor : firm alcoholic note but not hot . malt fruit note is pure and simple , im guessing special b and candy sugar in the brewing . there is a mild bubble gum note as well . there is an earthy quality as well , like sugar beets . definite belgian yeast quality lends it a trappist air .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : the beer comes to me in an imperial pint with a big , fluffy khaki head . after the head recedes , a lasting , chunky layer remains . as the glass is drained , a nice layer of lacing is left behind . the beer itself is a ruby brown in color .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a light brown iced tea like color . not much head at all .	00000000000000000
1	a : clear medium amber body with an inch of dense , creamy , off-white head . terrific retention and solid lace . gorgeous beer , plain and simple .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours dark brown with a soft white head , some lace .	00000000000000
0	a : peachy orange ; no head ( ! ) ; good carb action ; looks viscuous	00000000000000000
0	appearance : reddish drak amber tint	000000
1	a : poured into a franziskaner glass , a billowing soft white 2 '' thick head above a hazy amber body .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a hazy orange body with a sudsy white head that leaves light lacing .	00000000000000000
0	a : the beer pours dark brown in color with a little bit of murkiness to it . minimal head ( insert joke here ) .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : surely one of the best looking beer ever . the head is nice off white and really creamy and how the bubbles makes it brownish at first is awesome !	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : deep brown with a fantastic ruby hue . pours with a light head that reduces to light layer of bubbles and thick ring around the glass . very nice lacing . this is what a barley wine should look like !	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a reddish-amber color with a one-and-half finger white head that turns in a nice white lace .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : tawny , pilsner body with busy effervesence unfortunately props a head that is thin and inconsistent ...	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : wow , i actually had to pull the cork out of the bottle . no pop at all ! not a good start . poured out murky brown and completely flat . when swirled vigorously , a hair-thin light brown head forms on top . body is opaque , dark brown , and slick . no lacing . second pour produced a bit more head - looked much nicer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : cola . stiff pour resulted in slow forming head that overflowed . think sustaining head .	000000000000000000
0	a : 11.2 oz bottle . a soild 3 fingers worth of head . medium lacing , straw yellow in color .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : much thicker head than i would have thought with something this high gravity . it is a deep amber color but nothing noticeably different than a standard ipa . still nice looking .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : incredibly black with a dark tan head that froths and bubbles like a mud pot	00000000000000000
0	a : thin white head w/ no retention or lacing . pale golden body .	000000000000000
1	a : stiff pour in pils glass results in beautiful golden/orange with thick tannish head that flattens out . lacing remains throughout drink .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : the beer is a very pale yellow color with a thin white head that fades quickly and leaves a thin lace on the glass .	000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a lovely coffee-bean brown with a well-retained 3/4 finger chocolate brown , thick , soft head and bubbly lacing around the glass . very dark and viscous .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : light golden color with small head that fades quickly .	000000000000
1	a : this is quite a pale ale , clear gold with a light one-finger head that fades to a collar .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : pours pitch black . absolutely no light penetrates . anywhere . in fact , this beer allowed my glass to reflect everything as clearly as a mirror . beautiful , thick , dense foam with bubbles so tiny you can barely even notice them . almost like yeast cake . there is considerable , sticky lacing all over the glass except in the area where the top layer of foam is desperately clinging for dear life to the top of the glass . that area is simply caked with lacing . it just will not let go ! magnificent .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : no head ! nice carbonation , but no head ; cloudy , pale yellow	0000000000000000
1	a : a long , smooth , straight pour from on high results in a perfectly gorgeous stout : the opaque black body sits placidly underneath a dense dark-brown head that lifts itself almost to the brim of the over-sized tulip ; from there the chocolate-colored foam slowly dies down , leaving chunky lacing all down the sides of the glass . beautiful .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : dark black with a 2 finger mocha head	0000000000
0	a : it would appear that this beer is bottle conditioned . it has thick sediment at the bottom of the bottle . pours a very cloudy orange color . nice retention and decent lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : opaque dark red body with a finger of frothy reddish-tan head . ok retention and spotty lace . not particularly memorable-looking .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : thick , lacy , amazing head with this awesome falling bubble action -- like guinness but so much more visible & brilliant . clings well . very dark , amber brown body .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pale very light orange-bronze colour . very clear . the head is slightly off-white , moderately low and foamy . impaired retention and very little lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark brown body with no head and leaves no lacing .	0000000000000
0	appearance : nothing special -- an almost cloudy straw color . it keeps a small creamy head which i like .	000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a mahogany , ruby amber . zero carbonation , no pressure when cork removed , absolutely flat . from other reviews , this seems to be the norm but i ca n't help but subtract points for it .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : golden with heavy carbonation . nice head , soft and pure white . sheets of lacing	000000000000000000
0	appearance : clean copper in color . 1/2 inch thick white head . minute lacing .	0000000000000000
0	appearance : the backwoods bastard is a turbid brew , with a color between reddish-amber and auburn . it pours with very little evidence of carbonation . swirling the glass raises only a thin veil of ivory colored foam which dissipates quickly , though the foam does tend to hang around longer as the beer warms . this beer does n't create much lacing , just some sticky dots of foam on the glass . not very attractive , but maybe this beer has a nice personality .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : let me start off by saying that this is a breathtakingly beautiful beer . the body is a deep , clear , luminous garnet hue and sits invitingly beneath a 1-finger head of the creamiest foam i 've ever seen . retention is off the charts , and copious amounts of fluffy lace coat the sides of the glass all the way down . gorgeous .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this beer is surprisingly beautiful . it 's amber hued dark brown in color with a thick and creamy off white head . there 's some great retention to the head but there is n't much lacing going on .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : copper colored with a substantial head that fades to impressive lacing .	00000000000000
1	a : beautiful dark ruby . head was about a finger and a half and mostly white with a yellowish tint .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : this is a 5 for the can along . my father smiled just seeing it . he began to talk about work trips to rochester back in the 70s and drinking the piss out of genny . beer wise a fairly clear brown . poured with 2 fingers of white head that quickly went away .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a nice cherry / brown with a thin head that quickly dissipates . looks great .	0000000000000000000
0	a : poured clear ( yes i said clear ) bubbles with no head formation at all . this one is looking quite rough . there 's a murky toffee/carmel body that looks a bit redeeming , but the lack of head has me concerned . obviously there 's no lacing to speak of . this reminds me of so many `` brandy barrel aged '' offerings i 've had . however , i do n't think this thing has ever seen a barrel .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : an easy 3 finger head that just wo n't quit with amazing retention and spider web-like lines crisscrossing in the glass . the body is a dark amber bordering on brown with a very hazy aspect .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : aggressive pour yields 2 fingers of off-white head with good retention . copper colored liquid .	000000000000000000
1	a : pours jet black , no light passes through . builds an impressive black/brownish head .	00000000000000000
1	a : black body with great looking mocha head of a pinky that never goes away and leaves mountains of lacing in its wake . awesome .	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : bright , clear gold yellow color . poured a 2 finger frothy white head that gave way to a broken skim . decanted lightly . laced in thin rings .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a good looking clear pale amber color with a nice looking white head . leaves nice lacing on the glass . forget it after this .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a fairly virorous pour yeilds quite an impressive head four inches at first then cascades beautifully into a two inch fluffy coffee colored masterpiece of a head that stays a cap for the length of the tasting . a jet black beauty with suprisingly sticky lace . very inviting , almost seductive when the glass is paired with the bottle .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : so black i could n't see even a hint of light through it when i held it next to a 60w bulb . the head betrayed it ... too foamy , too lacey , not thick like you 'd expect from such a dark stout .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured very dark brown into a pint glass - chunky amber head disapated quickly , leaving nothing on the glass .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : a hazy honey / light amber body with gold tint when held to the light . pours with a finger of head that quickly recedes into nothing , despite a vigorous pour . uh oh . i think this one is flat , too . that explains why it took so much work to pull out the cork .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this was an orange brew with an incredible sustained bead . the head was thick and fluffy and just would n't go away , being fueled by all the rising bubles . it coated the sides of the goblet with lace , sometimes in solid sheets .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : it poured a clear diluted yellow body and a slender white head that did not generate much lacing but did support sticky long legs .	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pale slightly hazy apricot body with a big fluffy white head . the head sticks around for a while and leaves lots of clumpy lacing as it recedes . great looking beer . 5/5	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured into a pint glass . seems like this is the weakest looking of the doppelbock style - a style that i usally associate with a very dark and opaque appearance . a clear amber color , you can see right through it , giving it a deceptively weak appearance . michelob amber bock is darker than this , which is a big negative . one finger head quickly dissipates ( if it even forms at all ) . not a strong point here . way below average . made me not want to drink it .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear , bright gold body with moderate effervescence underneath a 3/4 '' , reasonably dense , white foam head . retention is mediocre at best , but there 's some nice solid lacing left behind . looks refreshing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a deep mahogany with a thin dirty white head that thins slowly and only leaves spotted lacing . poured in an american shaker pint	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a slightly murky amber / maroon body in my 1l hofbrau mug . the first pour is literally more than half foam , with a fluffy 5-finger-thick cap enveloping most of the mug . it retains for over a minute , crackling and snapping all the while , leaving a few wispy trails of lacing in its wake .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a dark amber red with a copper hue . there is a quarter inch white ring around the glass with some creaminess . there is some effervescence in the glass , and some bubbles on the bottom of the glass . the clarity is slightly hazy , but mostly clear .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dark , ruby red body . nice head on pour , but it dissipates rapidly , leaving very little lacing on the glass and very little head left as you finish the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : orange pale color of an ipa almost . chestnut off white head with little lacing and good haziness . fluffy head dissipated fast .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : bright yellow color with a thick white foam head that quickly dissipates . little to no lacing .	00000000000000000000
1	a : pours a light orange rind , hazy . decent sized off white head forms and holds for a bit . decent lacing .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a cloudy orange-caramel body . 1/4 '' tannish-white head fades to nothing very quickly , but surges back to 1/8 '' after every sip . a lot of yeast sediment floating around at the bottom of the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : carbonation not great ; a thin head sits on a very black body ( with perhaps a trace of purple )	00000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark nearly opaque brown . at first a two finger beige head forms . it gently recedes in a minute and leaves lots of spiderweb looking lace .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a very clear ruddy amber into a shaker pint . a 2-finger , off-white head forms on top and drops to a full cap of foam . lacing comes in solid sheets draping the entire height of the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours opaque black with a very large brown head that dissipates slowly and leaves good lacing behind .	00000000000000000000
0	a : hazy body , bubbly head that doesnt last or stick long enough . agitation doesnt bring enough back either .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : loads of carbonation while pouring , and a sizable head . it 's a light amber color and is very transparent . sparse carbonation bubbles .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : it poured a very cloudy amber with a pink hue . beautiful looking glass of beer . there was pretty much no head at all and the little it had dissipated fast .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark honey color with 2-3 fingers of light khaki head , which retains well and leaves good lacing .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : pours dark brown with a massive frothy head . the thickist lacing i 've ever seen covers the glass .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a ridiculously opaque black with mild brown edges when held to the light . the head is three and a half fingers of dark chocolate cappucino head . head retention is incredible . in fact , it 's as good as i 've ever seen .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a nice offwhite head with good retention . the beer is an opaque light amber color . good looking belgium ale .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : deep , hazy golden under a large white head . some lace and nice retention . nice looking beer .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : 12 oz bottle with no freshness date . i dropped this one into a samuel smith 's imperial pint glass at about 45 degrees . she pours a mildly cloudy , dark amber at the top with an orangish bottom . i am greeted with a light tan 1/8 inch head . after the initial pour , there 's only a couple fizzes coming up to the top and the head retains nicely .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours so dark brown that i almost think it 's black . the head is a joke ; very small , very airy and leaves almost no lacings .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : can was a little explosive when first opened , it had been sitting still for a while . the glass was mostly foam , but that quickly settled into some beer and two distinct heads . the `` bottom '' head is a pale yellow and cascading down into the beer . the `` top '' head is almost pure white with the heavy foam typical of nitros . the beer itself is a nice , crystal clear copper .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : somewhat clear , with a sort of bronze-y/copper look to it when poured .	0000000000000000
1	a : wow , this beer just out guinnessed guinness . not only were their falling bubbles in the head , there were lines of them . the black black bottom layer , the layer of bubbly head mixed with some more beer , and a layer of just liquidy foam , all racing for the bottom , defying the rules of physics . this beer is an obsidian black , no light comes through , not even from a maglight at point blank range . the head is dark tan and creamy , leaving a great lace as it goes down .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : an amber color with orangish hues . there was a one finger head but dissipated to a quarter inch white foam ring around the glass . the beer displays some effervescence . the clarity of the beer is slightly hazy , but for the most part clear .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured into a tulip . lots of sudsy , creamy white head atop a translucent but hazy orange gold brew .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : pours dark brown with a big tan head that erupted late into the pour . lots of thick lacing and a head retention .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : deep reddish brown color with a thick light tan head and moderate lacing .	0000000000000000
1	a : a nice clear golden copper with a big 1+ inch off-white head that fades at a decent pace , but never completely disappears . very good .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : when poured it leaves an amazing 2 in foam which then recedes into about an inch of foam which lasts for awhile .	0000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very pale yellow with a small head that does a real fast disappearing act .	00000000000000000

0	appearance : pours a clear , pale yellow , heavily carbonated , yet no lasting foaming or lacing .	0000000000000000000
0	a : umm ... more than a little bit fugly . even after letting this bottle sit for a couple weeks to let the setiment settle , this beer goes beyond hazy . murky with heavy , heavy setiment . very slight bubbled ring tops brownish red swamp of a beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : always cool to watch a guinness after it 's poured , it just never gets old . black in color , but see-through in the light . really nice tan head .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : color is a clear , thin straw . pours with moderate amounts of head , quickly dissipating with no lace . pretty much what one imagines horse urine to look like .	0000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : looks is the best attribute of this beer . it has a wonderful clear , deep maghogany color . it pours with a thick bright white head that quickly desipates to one-half finger in thickness . it does produce moderate lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : 3/4 '' white head that dissipated quickly over straw coloured liquid with excellent clarity .	00000000000000000

0	a : poured from the green bottle into a pint glass . somewhat of an aggressive pour left a rather large head ... that left rather quickly . a yellow translucent body , that is n't all that inviting .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark ale with limited translucency and little head . only a centralized light peanut cap evidencing the carbonation in the beer . no lacing .	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : great looking beer , dark and deadly , with an cloudy 2 cm brown leather head . lacing was pretty awesome on this stout as it clung on for it 's carbonated life .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured a golden straw yellow color with a one-finger head of creamy white foam and ample carbonation . lacing is the best part of the appearance , as it leaves a full sheet of webby lace down the opposite wall of the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : perfectly translucent light amber color . head is pure white and looks very creamy . retention and lacing are phenomenal considering the low abv . one of the best looking beer i 've see .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : black , touch of tan head , no retention , hint of leg .	0000000000000000

1	a : poured a very nice hazy amber , decent head	00000000000
1	appearance : perfect for an imperial stout . thick chocolate brown-black that pours more viscous than an irish stout . the head is huge and hangs around like a cappuccino . ( 4.5 )	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a hazy copper orange color . the head is almost soda like - fizzing away almost immediately after the pour .	000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a somewhat cloudy and dark brown beer , with ruby highlights . the head zoomed to the top of the glass , and amassed over three inches in height . the head is tan in color and is quite cakey . lots of sticky looking lace clings on , from top to bottom .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured a huge three finger dark tan head with great retention , leaving lots of lacing . black body .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : pretty color , a warming blend of muddled orange and apricot hues and a deeper ruddy pomegranate . hardly any head , a quick fizzle of froth and gone in seconds . almost no carbonation either , a few sleepy rising bubbles . no lace .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a hazy amber body with three fingers of white foam . this stuff is intensely carbonated - a torrent of rising bubbles keeps the head going for what seems like forever .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours golden clear with a lingering white foamy head . this head lasted the entire beer and left a beautiful lace . i do n't know if you could ask for anything better on appearance from a beer imho .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : dirty ruby-orange body with lots of carbonation and a head that just wont quit . the beige crown is exceptionally thick both in dimension and in density . this froth reminds me of a trick a czech broad taught me years ago when i was staying with her in france . if one could balance a small coin , the pre-euro czech equivalent to the dime on the head of a beer for ten seconds , then the beer was good . well this beer looks like its froth could balance a half dollar for a minute !	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : clear golden color . agressive pour resulted in half a finger of head that fell quickly , but surprisingly left a decent amount of lacing . 4.0	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : nice dark golden straw ( can we say wheat ) ; had a thick white head reduced slowly and laced down , ok.	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a cloudy orange with very little head or lacing .	0000000000000
0	appearance : deep brown with ruby edges . a nice multi-sized leather head formed then retreated to a thin cover . it formed some respectable lace . flavor : rich malt base with the slightest smoky peat edge . i normally dont like scotch ales because of the strong peat/scotch taste , but this is well proportioned . i get some sweet milk chocolate flavor as well . the alcohol is felt more than tasted , its warming my chest . a nice caramel flavor runs through the beer like a ribbon through ice cream .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : light copper color , sudsy head sticks around for a while , good clarity , inviting	000000000000000000
1	appearance : deep dark brown body . thick tan head just wo n't die ! ca n't think of many other beers that maintain such a great head for so long . beautiful lacing . a fair amount of sediment i did n't notice in previous tastings even with a fairly careful pour .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : nearly two fingers of a creamy nitro head firmly settles over an amber to caramel hue . i ca n't see through the glass because the lacing left behind by the wonderful retention is covering every speck of the pint .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pale clear yellow with less than a finger of white head .	00000000000000

0	appearance : : it pours a deep and hazy amber with lots of visible carbonation . the head was small for the style ( may have been a bad pour ) and did n't retain particularly well but had a nice even lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours black with just a bit of red around the edges and a respectable head . fades slowly to leave quite a bit of lacing on top of the beer and the galss .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a zero head , dark cloudy and brown .	000000000000
1	appearance : pours a red-orange color with a one inch head that quickly dissipates . moderate lace clings to the glass and stays put . no carbonation is present .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : which color ? this beer has no color . a finger height of foam .	00000000000000000
1	a : this was black and it poured with a huge , uneven , extremely sticky , and very long lasting tan head .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : coloring reminds me of iced tea with minimal lacing at the top	00000000000000
0	a : decent head , but weak retention . gold color ... nothing special .	000000000000000

1	a : yellowish gold , mild head - nothing special	0000000000
1	a : a bustling carbonation can be seen among a deep , dark red body . head nearly topples my glass , nearly doubling the size of the beer . retention is thorough . so is the lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured a burgandy brown with a thin head and a little sticky lacing .	0000000000000000
0	appearance : a murky concoction , a deep amber body with a thin off-white head . virtually no head retention and zero lacing , this beer is merely ok to look at . lots of yeasty floaties in the final pour , chances are this was bottled several years ago .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy thin light yellow , hazy translucent , unfiltered . it looks a little funky , albeit inviting and tasty .	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : arrived at the table with a thin , compressed , undulating , white head perched on top . body was opaque and golden-orange - looked exactly as it should ( in my opinion , anyway ) . active carbonation allowed the head to sustain itself for the entire session . long , leggy lacing stretched the entire length of the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : perfect . golden wheat yellow with nice carbonation and great lacing .	00000000000000
0	a : the bcs beers are n't know for the good looks and this is the same . poured a thick , viscous black color . the amount of fizzy medium brown head peaked about about one finger before quickly falling back into the bourbony abyss below . 4.5	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : very clear golden glass holds a nice head of white that laces impressively . flavor : mild sweetness has a slight artificial edge . corn flavor competes with a earthy hop that is almost powdery . no skunk in a clear bottle is pretty impressive .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : orange as juice , honestly , i might have thought that 's what it was if i was n't at a bar . there was no head , and no active carbonation that i could see .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this is a dark viscous looking beer . with a thin brown head that dissapates fairly quickly .	00000000000000000000

0	a : pours a somewhat murky dark mahogany , nearly opaque , with some ruby highlights when held to light . head is compact and dissipates , but leaves a one centimeter cap . little lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : clear deep yellow mug with a firm half finger of snowy white head that leaves thick sheets of lace with tidemarks . flavor : wet grain is the main flavor , some mild hop , a slight metallic twang , and very light fruit ester . what i dont taste is alcohol , which given the style , is a good sign . as it warms a bit , the flavor goes down hill , with the metallic note growing joined by a bit of cloying sweetness . serving suggestion : go cold , in a frosted mug .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark shade of gold . see through body with an tremendous white head ! lacing leaves layers after every sip .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : very dark plum with a finger of brilliant pink head . thick and heavy legs visibly show the hefty gravity this beer still possesses . very minimal lacing leaves about a half dozen spots on the glass . it looks big , it looks foreboding , it looks most impressive . 5/5	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a very pale yellow color with large head that fades quickly .	000000000000000

1	appearance : deep red , orangish brown . pours with a nice large head that has good retention . small amount of lacing as well . very transparent .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured it into a la chouffe tulip glass which turned out to be a good call . it has a dark amber/ medium brown color . the head on this stuff is unreal . just off white in color and has fairly large bubbles . perhaps some of the best head retention i have ever seen i think if i wanted to i could not only float a bottle cap on this stuff but an entire beer bottle . lacing all over the class in rings like the aging of a tree . it has taken at least 10 min for the the foam to subside and even now there is a good quarter inch remaining . well done .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : it pours a very crystal clear pale amber . once it 's in the glass it becomes a rosy red ... blood orange color . the bottom of the bottle has yeast in it . there is no head at all .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : 5/5 . crisp , golden color and clarity were on point . small head that did n't dissipate and held its own until the bottom third of the beer , but also not too thick and did n't lace the glass . ca n't say too much about a 5/5 ... they nailed it .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : golden in color ; pours a good amount of non-retentive head which left minimal lacing on my mug .	000000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy orange with big white chunks . bottle has sat undisturbed for about a week . not sure why the chunks are there . a thick off-white head that leaves oily laces down the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours an endless black , with one of the darkest brown heads i 've ever seen on a beer . an old man sitting adjacent to me said to his wife , `` did you see how dark that is ? '' great head retention and extensive , thick lacing , to start a great looking imperial stout .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a very flat-bodied , dirty , dark amber tea-ish colour , consisting of plenty of chunky yeast sediments of all sizes floating in the glass ... even after a force-pour , the beer head still comes to nothing , also suggesting a flat body .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the can functions exactly as advertised . poured a light tan suspension of tiny bubbles . as bubbles rose to the top , a clear . golden amber color was topped off with a thick , white , creamy head ( +0.5 ) . good head retention .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : this one is exceptional looking . golden color with huge foaming head that leaves fantastic looking lacing down the glass .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy and hazy light orange body with a thick , creamy off-white head . tons of sediment floaties in the glass due to the obvious unfiltered nature of these ithaca series beers . kind of disturbs the overall appearance .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : not a very picturesque irish dry stout . pours black/brown with a twinge of ruby . initially , a vigorous head , but it eventually bids farewell leaving being only a skimpy membrane of tan bubbles . certified organic ? well , that 's a relief !	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : the color is of pale straw . very small head when i poured it . the head situation just got worse as i drank it , eventually there was no head . this made the beer look like piss swill . next time i 'll drink it from the bottle .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : golden-yellow with a minimal head . looks almost like a lager .	00000000000000
1	appearance : pours a clear amber color with a thick creamy inch plus of head at first pour . there are a whole lot of bubbles rising to keep the head going for quite some time . there is a whole lot of lacing left after you drink it .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a hazy gold with no head . leaves no lacing . lots of particulate .	000000000000000000
1	a : as dark as an imperial stout , with a light brown head that sticks to the side of the glass almost obnoxiously ( this thing 's going to take some extra rinsing after i finish ) , it 's gorgeous all the way , for a porter with less than 6 % alcohol , this one has quite the threatening pour and presence .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark amber body with a thin , short-lived head of coarse white foam . forgettable .	000000000000000000
1	a : pours with a ferociously rocky , barely off white head . plenty of stick-to-the-glass so far . excellent retention . very volatile appearance but also very rich and luscious looking . appearance is hazy with a completely opaque burnt sienna , twenty year old penny color . the head is falling at a ridiculously inconsistent rate , creating lopsided mountains . 5.0 hands down . s &	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : an unhealthy pale urine-like color with soda fizz : barely pale yellow with some brown tones . if you ever pee like this , see a doctor .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : came in a uniquely shaped bottle with comments on how it was brewed in honor of the battle of britain . pours with a solid thumb and half finger of head that looks slightly creamy . the head itself laces like crazy and retains quite well . the beer itself is a crystal clear brown however the carbonation looks to be a little be excessive . still , impressive thus far .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a dark red color , nice sized head with great lacing down the glass	00000000000000000

0	appearance : slightly hazy yellow body with a very , very small , white head .	0000000000000000
0	a : poured vigorously into my tulip leaving a few small bubbles on the surface that fade in a completely flat surface . bottle stated very low carbonation so i expected this .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : clear honey-gold body with a creamy 1-finger , white head . head is pretty damn sticky and actually drags some lacing behind it . a very active carbonation feeds the head throughout the session , providing fantastic retention ! i 'm not really a pilsener man , but this looks damn good .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : beautiful , highly carbonated amber color with a thick , white , two fingered head .	000000000000000000
0	a : poured into my stone tulip . this is golden orange with crispy tangerine highlighting . head is about two fingers of snowy white bubbles . retention is very solid . lacing clings in ring like patterns all around the glass . i was n't overly impressed with the appearance but i quickly learned the old adage about judging a book by its cover .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a clear deep golden with 2 fingers worth of white creamy head . settles to a finger thick head the entire time and leaves thick walls of lace all over the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : standard pour yields a 1 finger , fine chocolate head with poor retention . beer is opaque black . lacing is patchy but with very little cling .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dark brown body , with little to no head when it settles . finishes looking like a flat lifeless porter . the head is a thin light brown colored halo which struggles to survive . staid rather depressing looks .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : aggressive pour yields 1/2 finger of tan head with okay retention . translucent dark brown liquid is too light for a stout . maybe a light colored porter or a dark nut brown - minus points for this .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a clear medium amber color with an extraordinarily firm head that laces like a cask ale	0000000000000000000

1	appearance : much better than average , especially for an aussie beer , and especially for one that does n't use chemicals to make it look good and hold head better - just about every aussie lager does this . if it really is brewed without additives , this is very impressive . lacing and carbonation are also attractive .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : super deep dark cherry red . almost like a deep red wine . crystal clear with a 1/2 inch white head that fades at a decent pace . very good .	000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : very clear bright peach yellow with a head of snow colors tiny bubbles . head after pour settled down to a thin spotty coat actively fed with carbonation . no lace and the head died off . flavor : a milder flavor than im used to , ive been drinking heavy beers lately , so this is a radical change of pace . its a very clean beer , no off tastes to be found . magnificent balance , it has a touch of sweet and a touch of bitter . the wheat is left to take center stage .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : beautiful cascading head , typical of all nitro cans ... but i never get sick of it . effect lasts for a minute or two , then settles into a modest , creamy head so dense that you could cut it with a knife . leaves a nice lacing as well..	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a mirky reddish concoction that just screams pour me out .	0000000000000
0	appearance : dark brown with amber edges . the off white head died down to a thin film and collar quickly , but is still actively carbonated . left the slightest tidemarks as lace . flavor : the almost lambic sour finish defines the taste . there is also some banana and bubblegum flavors in the background , as well as a touch of the malt , although this is very well balanced to allow the more subtle yeast and a bit of bitter chocolate/coffee tastes to come out , although their appearance is brief .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : i have seen some gushers but this beer takes the cake , creating a huge mess all over the kitchen counter and floor - by the time things settled down , half the bottle was lost ; what remains pours a cloudy amber color with a surprisingly modest head that left very little lace - imagine that !	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : i just had to pour this beer into a maudite ( damned one ) snifter . this damned beer poured a dark and murky chestnut/chocolate brown color . it was so dark and murky that it it looked like a solid black beer from a short distance , but a wall light cleared that up . wow ! what a disappointing head of foam this quad had . there was a small off white clored skim of foam , but even that quickly dissipated into about 10 bubbly rings along the edge . it did n't bother to leave any kind of lace behind . the bottle 's appearance was better than the beer itself .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : hazy lemon yellow with a short lived large bubble cap that didnt last or lace . flavor : coriander , which i love , is firm and fresh . none of the clove or banana you would expect from a hefe , so im leaning hard toward american wheat . lemon is the predominate fruit element , with a lemongrass finish .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : half of a finger of medium-dark brown head is produced on the pour and fizzes out rather quickly . the body is the darkest brown imaginable with tawny tints along the top edges of the glass . lacing is spare .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a deep burnt orange to brown . medium white head , average retention , limited lace .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours pitch black , pretty opaque as well . no head at all . a few big bubbles at the top , but it 's certainly not a beer head whatsoever . looks like a kid blew bubbles in his juice through a straw . looks very flat with no carbonation evident . a slight bit of off-white film lines around the edges of the glass , but that 's the only thing stopping me from thinking it 's dark juice .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : black as black can be , this is a very dark beer , which allows no light to pass through . it pours with a nice , half-inch deep head . unfortunately , the head dissipates quickly , leaving a few islands of bubbles and a crown of bubbles around the top .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : a golden colour with a cm head that dissipates very quickly .	00000000000000
0	a : this had about a half inch of head after the poor but it went away almost immediately . it has a real muddy brownish red color to it . there was no lacing at all probably due to the head going away so fast .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : black with a huge , light-tan head ; good retention & a wonderful lacing .	00000000000000000
0	appearance : poured into pint glass . weird pink hue that reminded me of pickled beets . i was afraid to spill in on my clothes for fear of a stain that would not come out . the head was this but stayed until the end with little lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : big bubbles rise through a brandy-amber body to form a head so weak and fizzy , i did n't even have time to notice its color before it disappeared . but i think it was off-white .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours into a duvel tulip very black with a thick , tan head . it 's quite sturdy and holds well with its combination of large and small bubbles . absolutely picture perfect with zero flaws .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark black body with chocolate hints on the sides . head is a solid three fingers of thick very creamy tan bubbles . very solid and falls slowly leaving very thick sticky webbed lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : a beautiful yellow/gold color with a humungous white head . the head takes a a while to subside as it bellows over the edge of the glass . this is crystal clear until the yeast is poured in then it is very cloudy and more yellow .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : the beer looks pretty bad . it 's as light and as carbonated as ginger ale , if not more so . there 's a thin plastic-looking head with no lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : a pretty clear caramel hued body . a real slight haze on an otherwise pretty clear brew . a slightly reddish off-white head is very busty . great retention and lacing . good looking brew indeed .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dark with a bubbly chocolate head that dissipates quickly	00000000000
0	a : golden-yellow , not much head . lots of sediment . unfortunately , the sediment did n't stick together , making it difficult to pour . i left 1/3 of the bottle behind with the first pour !	000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : this beer looks like double bastard on steroids ! deep red/brown/chai-tea color . super dark , hazy , intense . great head : foamy , caramel-y and bubbly ; lasts forever .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : looks like a light orange yellowish glow head : nice big thick white head	0000000000000000
1	appearance : it is a brilliant beer , with a touch of orange to nudge it just a smidge past gold , with a white creamy head that has some staying power and leaves laces as it recedes . drink with your eyes . this beer is inviting . aroma , taste , and	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this looks great . it is a hazy golden yellow with a massive white head . this looks like a well built wheat beer .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear mahogany color . the head is fizzy at first but recedes quickly into nothing , with no lacing left behind .	00000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : 12oz bottle poured into a standard pint . colour is a pale , cloudy yellowish-white ; think the colour of pineapple gummi bears . 1/2 inch head fades quickly into a mere puff on the surface . very slight visible carbonation .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : light brown ? ! ? ! in an imperial stout ? enormous head .	0000000000000000
1	a : color is pitch black while the pale brown massive head is so very thick and creamy . slow dissipation leaves lacings galore .	0000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a dark and murky copper pour . definite floaties in there and carbonation veins stream through the body of the beer . head retention is nice . an ivory color with a sudsy character to it .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours black with a very small mocha head that goes straight to the sides . no lacing .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : this one was a gusher for sure . watch out ! pours a big 3 finger medium-thin tan head . colour is an opaque very dark brown , close to black . no real carbonation evident . a thin film stays until the end and leaves some lacing down the glass , but nothing special .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : huge creamy brown head and curtains of sticky lacing . imperial stout black as well	00000000000000000
0	a : a bit darker than your typical hefeweizen , but otherwise quite similar . i should have poured this into a weizenglas out of interest . thin head though - it 's definitely an english ale . not very true to style , but all right .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : looks like a typical macro pilsner , straw yellow with a foamy white head that receeds quickly . no lacing . yawn .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear amber-orange with substantial off-white foam filling my duvel tulip . it retreats slowly , falling in sections like a breaking iceberg , leaving beautiful , sticky clumps of lace down the sides of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : i got ta give credit where credit is due . this is truly a picturesque beer . amazingly clear amber body filled with tons of quickly rising bubbles that form a thick rocky head on the top of the beer . i give this a 6 on appearance .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : poured cloudy orange/yellow with / small white head from a from a 750ml .	0000000000000000
1	appearance : the pure hoppiness pours a bright , brilliantly clear yellow-orange-ish color with a nice half-inch head that sticks around for quite some time . a boat load of bubbles continuously rises from the bottom of the glass as well . the lacing is outstanding .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : light leather brown with scant , fizzy off-white head with no retention and no lacing .	000000000000000000
1	appearance : very dark with a ruby tinge , tan head that dissipates quickly	00000000000000
1	a : pour is light ; straw-colored . the large white head is kind of fluffy and dissipates rather quickly into rich lacings .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : a pretty flat looking beer without much bubbles . pours a orange hay color .	00000000000000000

0	appearance : pours a murky very dark brown with a half finger of tan head that goes away completely .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : hazy grain color , with no head whatsoever , no lacing on the glass .	00000000000000000
0	appearance : there was a one finger white head that lasted only a few seconds . there are a lot of effervescence in the beer . the clarity of the beer is hazy . the color of the beer is a nice orange color with yellow hues .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : orangish gold with a nice , long lasting , foamy , off white head	0000000000000000
0	appearance : hazy , pale yellow brew with light carbonation and no head	0000000000000
1	a : one of the most attractive aspects of this beer is the inky blackness of it , topped with the mocha head that clings all the down the glass , right until the last swallow .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pitch black , poured a one finger mocha head that left nice lacing all the way down the glass as the beer was drank . there was also no clarity or signs of carbonation .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : since it 's bottle conditioned and i do not like yest in my beer , i poured it carefully down the side of the glass producing no head .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : tremendous 3 finger head , great cascading effect , pours very thick	00000000000000
0	a : clear gingerbread color beer with almost no head . really boring looking beer , does n't look very appealing .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pitch black body , and one finger of dark tan foam , which falls slowly . head leaves a nice layer of foam on inside of glass . nothing wrong here . flavor : similar to the aroma , unfortunately , but the tartness is a bit overwhelming . upon checking other reviews for this one , i quickly confirm what i 'd suspected . this brew was not meant to have a tart edge to it . it looks like an extremely unlucky time for me with one of my favorite breweries , ccb 's , brews ... two infected bottles in the past week .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured a light , pale golden yellow with a two-finger head of fine , white foam . lager-like in appearance , so a bit lighter than i would 've liked it to be .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : whoops ! heavy pour results in massively foamy head ( four or five iinches ... yikes ) which actually settles into a decent two-finger head after a moment . user error there . beer is a pale golden color with abundant carbonation which eases off after a few moments . looks filtered , not murky at all . the receding head leaves a light trace of foam around the inside of the glass . all things considered , it looks like an adjunct lager should .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : light straw . very minimal carbonation . even with an aggresive pour i bet there 'd be no head retention here .	000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : crystal clear . huge head . best part of this beer .	00000000000000
1	a : poured a cloudy lemon with an off-white foamy head . good carbonation and lacing .	00000000000000000
0	appearance : a solvent-looking thing . no head whatsoever , completely tepid . no lacing , either . body is a murky shade of plain brown , but when light strikes it i get some pretty amber/red shades . the latter saves this from being scored lower . i can forgive the lack of head/solventness ( it is a barley wine , after all ) , but the color could use some sense of innovation .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours an orange-gold body with big foam head .	00000000000
0	appearance : sparkling , clear pale yellow . the head at first is pretty nice ( great really ) , but there 's almost no retention ( gone in 2 minutes ) and no lace . that 's not how a tripel should look .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : yellow golden , clear , pours with very little head that disappears instantly . no lacing .	0000000000000000000
1	a : dark dark black with a frothy lively light brown head on top that dissipated quickly but clung nicely to the glass . 5.0	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a slightly hazy yellow-gold with a finger of white head that recedes into a thin layer with no lacing .	00000000000000000000000
0	appearance : thin head . hazy pink/amber body . looks underwhelming .	000000000000
1	a : the best aspect of this beer is definitely it 's appearance . it pours pitch black with a brown head .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : super dark brown to black with dark tan head , though very weak and lasting only seconds after pour .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : poured light brown ( med-light maple syrup color ) with absolutely no head .	0000000000000000
0	appearance : like the other trout river bres , this one had very little head . however , it did pour a decent dark brown color .	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this is a dark amber color .	000000000
0	appearance : purple colored brew with a frothy pink head	0000000000
0	appearance : ever-so-slightly hazed , light copper-brown . chunky , dull , pale yellow head comes and goes rather quickly .	000000000000000000000
0	appearance : the color of apple juice . little to no foam retention . steaming carbonation almost invisible to the naked eye .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : blonde orange , small head ; not much carbonation or lacing	0000000000000
1	a : beautiful medium-to-dark brown hazy body with good , creamy head . great , thick cap .	000000000000000000
1	a : poured a glowing yellowish orange , cloudy , with a nice white cap . exceptional poor and appearance .	000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dark , dirty brown , hazy with a full tan head . almost looks like sweet tea .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : dark brown with a trace of red , quite clear . two fingers of frothy , dense , sticky-looking , light tan head . foam stayed around several minutes , leaving tons of lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : dark borwn in color with a nice 2 '' head that slowly falls to a thick surface foam . nice lacing develops .	0000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : opaque yellow with .5 finger head . carbonated with lots of tiny bubbles .	0000000000000000
0	a : the bottle design is probably the best part about the beer . big sky has great continuity with their design . however , the idea of calling the beer `` slow elk '' with a drawing of a cow with elk antlers roped on is pretty funny . i digress ... the wear pours terribly into a snifter , for a stout that is . foams too heavy , carbonation does not rise like a stout usually does . dark body with an amber touch when put up to light . head is lumpy and whitish tan .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : this beer poured a nice golden color , but produced absolutely no head , and seemed under carbonated . this could have been a by product of shipping .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : little if any head which disappears when poured . leaving a very translucent orange/tan colored water .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : opaque orange , very thin lacing and soapy bubbles . you 'd get a bit of head on it only after significant swirling . for something that 's been sitting a while in the cellar , it 's nothing unusual .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a cloudy dark brownish red that resembles apple cider . a vigorous pour leaves only a very mall ring around the perimeter of the liquid	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : gorgeous orange color , great two finger head , and decent lacing . extremely active carbonation ... do n't see a beer with this type of carbonation often .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a very clear , alsmost watery looking golden with no carbonation bubbles floating at all . the head is beautifully thick with very tiny bubbles . very creamy .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : looks nice ! good copper/bronze color , nice thick head .	0000000000000
1	a : huge head , lots of carbonation and lacing . this beer is light in color but cloudy with carbonation .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : poured a very dark brown with a finger head and pretty good lacing sticking to the glass .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a nice urine looking light yellow w/ a non-existent head	0000000000000
1	a : this brew pours a beautiful sunset orange , effervescent with bubbles riding on their little bubble elevators up to the head , where they frolic upon the frothy , sticky stubbornness and bask in the lamplight under which i am ogling this inviting beverage .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a lightly hazy yellow with a light white head , some lace .	0000000000000000
1	appearance : very cloudy , as it should be ; white head ; questionable head retention	0000000000000000
1	appearance : opaque burnt amber with a creamy white head . the head retains well , and leaves a really beautiful lace .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : looks just like an imperial russian stout should - thick , heavy head , great lacing , very dark with brownish head .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : very nice deep brown color , great thick velvety head	000000000000
0	a : extremely cloudy dark amber body under a finger of creamy tan head . average retention for the strength and some spotty lacing . not bad , but hazy to the point of muddiness .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : more golden than expected , but the big knocks are the lack of lacing , head retention and the surprising amount of floaters in the glass	0000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a pale yellow color with orange highlights . there was no head did a hard pour at the end and it resulted into nothing . there are couple bubbles coming from the bottom . the clarity of the beer is slightly hazy .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : light straw color , lustrous snow-white resilient head , bubbly , tasteful amount of haze ( after swirling the last bit of beer and dumping it in )	000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : reddish brown , no head , and no lacing .	000000000000

1	a : gorgeous . love this blood red to burnt orange appearance.there is just something very alluring about this tone .	000000000000000000000
0	a : incredibly foamy . head filled 3/4 of the glass and took minutes to die down . tons of greenish whitish milky sediment at the end of the pour .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : we opened this up over the sink to be on the safe side , but it showed no inclination to gush whatsoever . could this somehow be an exception to the rampant infection issues besetting this beer ? do you believe in miracles ? it pours a black body with a finger of coarse tan foam . decent retention and light lacing . nice enough .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : huge light tan head , brownish read color . lookin ' good !	000000000000000

0	appearance : very cloudy , muddy pour , a dark ruby-purple .	000000000000
0	a : pours quite dark with an average sized head ; there are large chunks of yeast at the bottom of the bottle and lots of it . i usually do n't mind the yeast , but the chunks just make this beer look unappetizing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : looks great . nearly three fingers of thick frothy head . great retention and plenty of lacing . 3.0	000000000000000000000

0	a : light yellow with an inch of white head	0000000000
1	appearance : opaque black covered by a thin sheet of persistent head on top , with stubborn , cohesive lace coating the sides .	000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours wonderfully and has a slow-developing head ( very similar to guinness ) . once it settles it has a nice , rich look .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours out a light , slightly chill hazed peachy brown , looks a little bit like iced tea , especially with the thin and wispy cap of sandy white head that tops this beer . head fades into a ring rather quickly , no lacing , but a decent amount of carbonation showing through in some slowly rising ropes .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a hazy orange with three fingers of beige head that recedes into a thin ring with little lacing .	0000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a nice medium tan head that boils up filling the glass if you do n't use the sneak-it-down-the-side pour technique . the head has large bubbles and they form larger air pocket/bubbles as it goes down . the beer is a dark brown slightly black color . hold it to the light and you get some significant red garnet coming through . not as thick black as the label describes . the head fades down and get 's thicker and creamy on top .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured from a `` fourty , '' colt 45 is a clear straw yellow with a very little head . looks like every other mass produced lager you 'll see .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a nice black liquid with a huge amount of dark brown head . i thought the head was due to my pour or something with my glass but after reading the other reviews , i see that this is just one of the features of this beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : wow . what a beautiful beer . from bottle to pint , it pours beautifully , giving a thick , deep , deep red body with sediments within , about as buoyant as the brew itself . small amount of strong ivory head . minimal trace , but resonates .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : this beer is gorgeous . pale amber color has great clarity and the beer is filled with swirling carbonation from tiny bubbles . the carbonation supports a rocky amber tinged cap that starts big , stays strong and floats on top of the beer the whole way down the glass . heavy sheets of lace are left in the beer 's wake .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours jet black with a big frothy head . good sustain and tons of lacing .	000000000000000000
0	a : pale , filtered wheat . boring . what the heck are they trying to do ?	000000000000000000

0	a : poured a clear pale orange-yellow color wit ha thin white head that faded quickly .	00000000000000000
0	a : a pretty , lightly hazed amber-garnet with scattered rising bubbles . unimpressive , a barely-covering film , dwindling to a star-shaped splotch , to a completely irrelevant sheen . despite a nice color , an otherwise sad and lifeless pour .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a fairly bright amber with a nice two finger white foam white , which sadly falls flat within minutes .	00000000000000000000000

1	appearance : the bubbles ! oh the bubbles ! they really do sink ! it 's amazing ! perfect lacing and foam . nice dark brown color , almost red when it 's in the light . nothing beats this .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : completely black ( no surprise ) with an almost non-existent cappuccino colored head that disappears immediately leaving no lace .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours out completely pitch black and very viscous-looking . about a finger of a dark brown/orangish tinted head forms . a bit in the way of lacing , and okay retention . this is definitely one of the more impressive imperial stouts as far as viscosity that i 've seen , which really picks this beer up from an appearance standpoint .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : very light golden brown and lightly hazed . head is not really there , much like the last terrapin beers i had ... bit off white and a very minor ring around the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : mocha bomb looks awesome on the pour , very dark brown and it looks pretty thick . about 3 fingers of mocha colored head forms . retention is great , as is the lacing . one of the best looking imperial stouts i 've tried .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : very hazy from the yeast with a pale yellow hue , varied bubbled white lace that holds a great retention and stays until he beer is gone .	000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours pretty much opaque black . a two finger tan head rises with good retention . light lace is left as the foam gently recedes after a few minutes .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : its very foamy when poured and it takes a while for the head to settle and when it does it looks like cat pee	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a beautifully clear orange/amber , with an off-white foamy head , that slowly bursts its bubbles down to a thin raft . good lace hanging on .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pale cloudy straw w/ thick white head that leaves a nice lace	00000000000000
0	appearance : red/amber , clear color . enough carbonation but a weak head . immediately goes to a thick collar-never a tall or thick head . some lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours a super clear burnt copper with honey folds . the crown is 2 fingers , slightly off white ( light khaki ) , shows good retention and good lace .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a copper color with a small off-white head that dissipates quickly .	000000000000000
0	appearance : pours the translucent , pale-yellow color common in most macro lagers . what little fizzy head there was dissipates immediately leaving absolutely no lacing . i wonder if this beer is best had straight from the bottle rather than poured ...	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : after pouring this beer into my glass , i said i might have to pass . a light honey , golden color . the appearance brought about a dissapearance in my excitement . a litle cloudy , with very little lacing , half finger head , quite a mysterious spread for an ipa .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : an aggressive pour yields a transparent beer with an off white head that rises to oveer two inches and almost spills over the glass . bubbles are varied in size and lace has no qualms about hanging out on the sides of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear golden or yellow color with a large head , no lacing , and the head was gone in a few minutes ...	0000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a medium amber color with a slight orangish tint . there was a one finger foamy head but it dropped like a rock . there is only a visible white ring around the pint glass . there is a lot of effervescence at first but it slowed down to a medium pace . the clarity of the beer is clear and brilliant .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a little bit of a disappointment in the pour . a pale golden , with a rather fizzly head - i could almost confuse this with ginger ale or something . s +	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : well , it only produced a finger of head that did n't lace or sustain whatsoever . the body is as dark as night but show cases decent carbonation and a deep and dark ruby .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : what a beautiful ale ! pours a deep ruby , almost mahogany color with a nice head and plenty of lacing . unfortunately , it 's not much more than a great looker .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a deep reddish brown with a nice head , but little retention . carbonation is plenty as it clings to the glass in clumps . not much lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a glowing , clear dark red with a fluffy , soft white head that has a light pink tinge to it . head took forever to slowly fade into a thick film that lasted the whole beer through and left a dense sheet of lacing down the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : cloudy lemon yellow with a thick , foamy white head . the yeast from the bottle conditioning hangs out like someone hocked a loogie in your beer .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : the beer arrives with a small tan head that is quick to disappear and settles in without any film , collar or lacing . the color of the body is a notch below pitch black . zero transparency - even at the edges and the thinnest parts of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : bright golden beer with a lot of fairly large yeast sediment floating about in suspension . there 's vibrant carbonation , and a snow white cap that soon fades to a persistent film .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : 3.5 ,	0000
0	appearance : clear golden color , with a big head that settles down after a moment to about a finger 's width of foam . beer is unusually clear for a hefeweizen .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured rather gently into a pint glass . mid-sized head dissipated into a ring after about a minute . the overall appearance of the rest of it was fantastic though ; a beautiful golden orange , sort of amber color . held up to the light it 's almost opaque .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : this pours a cloudy , dark golden color , with a little bit of an amber tint . there is a very small head , leaving a thin collar . however , it does leave some lacing on the glass . visibly apparent are the floating yeast particles .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours out a clear golden color with a small fizzy white head . quickly subsides to nothing . no perceptible lacing . odd , not even a trace of orange in it .	00000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a creamy , 1 finger milk chocolate colored head with possibly the best retention i 've seen on an imperial stout . beer is viscous , oily , and pitch black . lacing is patchy and stringy but sparse with decent stick and nice legs . overall a fantastically beautiful brew .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear , brilliant copper/mahogany body with a 3/4 '' , creamy , light tan head ; solid retention and tons of tight-knit lacing . beautiful , rich-looking beer - by far the best i 've ever seen come out of a plastic milk jug !	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours deep brown going-on-black , with a tinge of amber around the edge of the glass when held up to the light . even a straight pour produces almost no head which dissipates quickly and leaves no lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : it pours an incredibly murky brown color . very hazy , very brown . there is nothing red about this beer . in fact , this does not look like a red at all . that 's not a bad thing . actually , it 's strangely compelling , what with the 1.5 fingers of off-white head . an interesting take on the style .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : a coppery orange color that had a one finger head . there is carbonation in the beer . the head dissipated to a quarter inch and it is slightly foamy . the beers clarity is slightly hazy , probably from dry hopping . the carbonation bubbles are forming a slightly foamy lily pads on the beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pale/slight orange tint , clear , minimal carbonation . but the head is the real beauty for this one ; a duvel like frothy/clingy head with tons of retention and copious lacing . 5/5	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : piss yellow . actually , a tad paler than that .	0000000000000

0	a : pours an opaque light amber . rather thin head that disappears immediately and becomes faint lacing . very faint . i 'd call it `` eleven bubbles '' before i 'd call it lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : sludgy , cola-brown , barely any head at all , just a really thin veil . it 's pretty much average looking for the style , it does n't mean i have to like it ...	00000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a deep redish brown with the smallest head i 've ever seen which fades as quickly as it forms and leavs no lacing on the glass . i poured it pretty aggresively so i 'm not sure if this is normal ... the cap gave a hiss when i opened it so the lack of a head was a bit surprising .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dark amber brown color . a thin bubbly white head forms at first though dissapears in a second . no lace , and looks dead and lifeless .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : with a slight gurgle from the widget as i cracked open the can , a bit of foam seeped from the top . the pour yielded a beautiful , almost pure black beer topped with a light tan , one finger thick layer of head that i ca n't really say was foam because it stuck around so damn long . a good looking beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours pitch black , 2 finger deep tan head , settles into a full , yet thin , cap , leaves lacing everywhere and desperately tries to hold on , which it eventually loses . held to light , it 's letting zero light through . wonderful looking stout .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear dark orange with hues of brown.thick off-white head boasts great retention . rings of foamy lacing cling everywhere . it is a nice looking beer .	00000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours dark brown with a khaki to light tan head . the beer shines dark amber when held up to a light . the head retention is really great considering the alcohol level and the lacing is pretty nice .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : my initial pour was with way too much enthusiasm . gave it another more careful pour and this one is a hazy pale and light whitewashed gold color . the head on this beer was awesome . massive , white , and frosty . impeccable retention and sheets of rowed lacing down the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : a cautious pour yields a thicker , fluffy looking tan head that fits the top of the glass perfectly . colour is a nice opaque seal brown with some carbonation evident , which quickly dies off . head has good retention and eventually fades to a decently thick film . film remains until the end and leaves some nice lacing down the glass . the look of this beer is fantastic , and it looks like a piece of art in the beautifully crafted rochefort glass . i 'd almost rather take a picture of it instead .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : this beer pours a rich copper/red brown with orange highlights . i usually pour my beers rather vigorously to try to generate a nice big head , but a huge frothy off white head formed from a gentle pour . it lingered for a very long time and left amazing lacing down the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : first of all , love the look of the bottle , and that is actually something i do take into consideration when i 'm rating the appearance . i take into account the overall presentation of a beer . cap , bottle , and actual look of the beer are all things i look at . clear bright goldenrod/honey hue . 1 to 2 finger thick fluffly head which disipated at a moderate speed . the head leaves a nice blanket on top of the beer and also leaves sticky foamy lacing on the glass that dries into place . looks like a great beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : there was a solid off-gas when the top was popped , so this beer must be pretty well carbonated . it pours a somewhat cloudy burnt orange color with a very small & lt ; 1/8 '' head after a pretty quick pour ... surprising after the off-gas . there really is n't any lace left , and the beer does n't really do that much else visually	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : nice dark amber colour , minimal lacing but lasts well in the glass . unfortunately , the yeast seems to be a not particularly flocculent variety which makes it hard to pour without getting a lot of yeast into the beer and clouding the whole thing up .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : straw yellow and very clear . 2 finger head rapidly dissipates .	00000000000000
0	a : pours a clear , light pale 'wheat ' yellow . capped with just a thin white head , a 1/4 '' at best , which fades away quickly . relatively little rising carbonation , no head , virtually no lace .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a small frothy white head while the body of the beer is kind of an ugly yellow beige color . the head did not last too long and the lacing was sub-par .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a dark hazy ruby with a head that dissipates quickly , really dark for an aipa .	00000000000000000000
1	a : a nice look with a tan head and plenty of lacing left on the glass . dark dark brown hue and a nice fluffy pinky of head that remains for a while .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : starts off nice , with a pretty half inch white head on top of a golden , pumpkin ( what else ! ) color . almost like a jack-o-lantern in a glass . unfortunately , that was only good thing about this beer , imo .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a solid black with an abundant head of very dark brown bubbles which show incredible retention -- perhaps the best looking ris i am yet to encounter .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : liquid orange-gold like honey with a stretched out high flow viscosity . active carbonation . pillowy big bubble head . sticky . nice eye candy .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : really light looking , thin brown cheap maple syrup with perhaps even some lighter cranberry juice character to the body . this really could pass for a plum iced tea with the complete lack of head . literally no head formation , no lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : lovely amber pour with light cream colored head . very effervescent . head retention poor for style .	00000000000000000000
1	a : medium-dark amber with dense white head that stays around . i was surprised at the head retention ; it just wo n't die .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : light gold hazy body , a robust head that was quick to run off . nothing spectacular , more a weak start to a damn fine brew .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a comparatively dark pour yields a small , one finger , thinner looking , really noisy , light tan head that quickly vanishes . black body with higher levels of carbonation decorating the top of the brew . head quickly fades to a splotchy wisp with lots of carbonation fizzing to the top . ring remains with no wisp , leaving no lacing at all . looks like fizzy coke by the half way point .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : almost clear golden yellow , super thin white head sl : grain , maybe some corn , but not much really	00000000000000000000000
0	appearance : clear , medium-light straw with a large , white , foamy head that quickly diminished . only a little lacing early .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a beautiful 1 1/2 finger dark brown head . the liquid is viscous , has great bubbles throughout , some yeasty floaters , and coats the glass with exceptional lacing . even leaves a little particulate behind in the lacing which i find to be a great thing . it pours a deep black that only allows a little light around the edges in mahogany tones . this is a great looking beer in every way .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : a monster two finger head that has good retention with a nice off white color ; furthermore , the head is frothy and creamy and there is some lacing on the glass . the color of the beer is a beautiful orange color with some copper hues . the clarity of the beer is hazy from yeast ; however , there are some carbonation bubbles visible on the side of the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dark amber , good clarity , not much head development	000000000000
0	a : deep amber , almost opaque-looking unless you hold it up to a light . little itty bitty head , surprising because i gave this a fairly aggressive pour and it seems pretty sparkley .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : beautiful red , super fine bubbles . glorius .	00000000000

0	a : two finger head devoid of cream , very thin , and of bad retention . hazy murky dark yellow-gold colour . sm : citrusy orange fruit ester hops over top a moderately full barley body .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a black pour produces a very small , faint , tan head that vanishes almost immediately . head barely makes an appearance and is gone . a stringy wisp and ring remain . jet black body with zero carbonation evident . ring remains but leaves no lacing down the glass . thick looking stout , but average at best .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a clear muted amber with an active but unsettled head , quickly fading in to what looks to be spit ?	00000000000000000000000
1	a : clear , medium golden color with over two fingers of persistent white foam head . heavy lacing remains on the glass and a lone bubble occasionally climbs slowly in the column .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : amber colour and a 15 mm head that fades to very good lacing . 4.5	00000000000000000
0	appearance : a very dark black pour , and relatively thick as well . a one finger , medium-thin , noisy , tan head with lousy retention forms and quickly crackles down to a slight wisp and ring . jet black body , opaque , with no carbonation evident . only a slight ring remains leaving no lacing down the sides , and it looks a little flat by the end . thick , dark pour and body , but lousy head .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : larger sized bubbles than the cervoise , but also vigorous carbonation , strawberry in color .	000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear orange body with 3 fingers of off-white head . retention is spectacular , and the film collapses in sections over several minutes into a light collar on the brew . there is a thick sheet of sticky lacing down the glass as i drink . lazy bubbles up the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear , deep copper body with a modestly sized but stout and somewhat persistent cream white head . no lacing to be found however .	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : i do n't often give beers 5 for anything , and almost never appearance . but this is amazing . the falling bubbles , the swirls , the creamy head that does n't just have a harsh stop to it but sort of melts into the beer . it 's black body with a sandy colored solid head . saying this sounds disgusting but in reality , it looks like solidified bacon fat .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pour a vibrant golden yellow with a beautiful towering white fluffy head . i have never in my life seen so many bubbles fleeing from the bottom of the glass , this is amazing . its almost violent . the sediment is getting throw around like it was in a tumble dryer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : very cloudy , light tan , some light lacing , and a little head .	00000000000000000
0	a : the serving container for this beer was a plastic jug , as it had been brought from the widmer cellar by our host . frankly , the color of muscat love and it 's cloudy plastic vessel reminded me of a urine sample ! in the glass , the golden liquid retained most of those characteristics , unfortunately ... however ...	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : apple juice color . lots of fizzy head that dissipates in seconds . less head then a soda . bubbles of co2 remind me of champagne .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : light yellow cream foam dissipates leaving a dim amber ale .	0000000000000
1	a : very deep reddish brown with a 2-finger tan head that settles nicely to 1/2 a finger .	0000000000000000000
1	a : as pale lagers go , this one has a stellar look . straw yellow with a high and dense white head that drops very slowly leaving chunks of lacing . not what i was expecting here .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this one pours a bright amber color and is topped with an off white head . fantastic head retention as well as lacing .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy ( almost dirty ) brown color . poured no head , outside a tan skim that stayed to the edges . a few thin rings of lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : mahogany with ruby highlights and a clear body , this beer does n't really look much like mud . pours a pleasant off-white creamy head that slowly settles into a creamy skin and then mild lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : the pour yields that classic guinness settling action , which is always pretty cool . it looks great but it still looks better on tap . a thin tan head sits atop a body of darkest crimson/brown . the beer looks black unless it 's held up to the light .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a deep space black . it 's questionable whether light can escape from the glass . a gorgeous thick tan head that leaves major league lacing accents what is a beautiful beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy orange body with only a wisp of foam atop the exceedingly full pour . i blame the bartender more than the beer though , but of course getting an extra ounce of liquid beer is n't exactly something to complain about .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : nice mix of gold and brown chestnut . good enough head retention . no lacing .	000000000000000000
1	a : an initial pour down the far side of the upright tulip explodes with carbonation ; the next 10 ounces go in with great trepidation and multiple top-offs , resulting in a towering off-white head with creamy foam sticking nearly an inch above the rim of the already-oversized glass . now that 's a ton of head . the body is a fairly dark reddish-amber , with some spiraling tendrils of sediment and a solid column of vigorous carbonation rising from the etched bottom . the massive head sticks around for quite a while , receding in chunks and leaving lots of lace . it 's beautiful , but i 'm afraid that the over-the-top effervescence could forebode infection . still , that fear should n't take away credit from a gorgeous beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : deep gold , with very good clarity for a bottle conditioned beer . a soapy white cap starts huge before disappearing to a small ring at the beer 's edge . leaves occasional spots of lace . the beer 's weak spot .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours with a small off-white head that disappears quickly . relatively speaking , the body is a dark shade of amber orange . lacing is spare to none .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : beautiful dark amber color with an excellent bubbly head that lasted the entire beer . laced in feathery clumps that only attended to the wonderful appearance .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : nice amber color with a golden/brownish tint . solid finger and half head that leaves slowly . flying dog makes some beautiful beers .	00000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a dark reddish brown color with good clarity as a lager should . a huge beige head forms and takes a minute to recede . spiderweb looking lace is left all the way down the glass . this is a looker .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this could be the prettiest ipa i 've ever poured ... perfectly clear , yet seductively deep , copper/caramel orange . a blizzard of swirling carbonation fills the glass and that first pour builds a billowing 3-fingers of fluffy ivory . head drops slowly in rocky chunks , leaving a thick lace of sparkling cream . if not perfect-looking , damn close to it .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : hazy , medium amber color with a diminishing residue of parchment-tinted foam . no lacing remains on the glass , and some scattered yeast sediment is visible at the bottom .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : just like any good old stout ... black , with some translucent properties when held up to light . not sure whether it was the glass or not , but the head was on the weaker side as was the lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : very hazy dark copper amber glass sported a short lived whitish head that dropped to the barest of collars . flavor : very fruity , again , mostly grapefruit rind and juice . signature st. arnolds taste , yeast im guessing , runs as a ribbon through the hop field . hops are sticky west coast , almost too intense , but supported with a good base to keep your head from imploding . the finish comes across as a little green , which might mellow with some aging .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours copper with a really small white head that leaves some lacings .	000000000000000
1	appearance : 8 oz serving in a medium sized snifter , ned 's red pours a purplish , shoe polish color with deep red hues and an off white cake head that rapidly dissipates to leave rather attractive lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a dark black with a large tan head . the head lasted as long as the beer did . leaves a nice lacing all the way down the glass as i drink it .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a crisp looking , dark-brown cream-ale . 2-finger head thats lasts for 20 minutes+ .	00000000000000000
1	a : awesome appearance and spot on for a witbier . cloudy like a cumulonimbus . completely murky and no chance to see through to the other side . very turbid . light whitish yellow in color with a white , creamy head , kind of spare . almost no lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : fizzy clear light yellow . almost no head at all with no lacing .	0000000000000000

1	a : pours bright cloudy yellow , with a frothy two finger white head . head does leave some chunks of lacing . looks great .	00000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : all foam ; great retention , but looks like a ski resort	00000000000000
0	appearance : deep red-mahogany with particulates floating ( the reason for the low score ) . loud , crackling , thick tan head .	000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a generic pale gold/straw color , very clear . nice airy white head , but it does n't last long at all .	00000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : lightly hazy , orangey-amber body with a frothy , off-white head .	00000000000000
0	appearance : ok look , nothing in the price range or reaching to ~ $ 5 per 6 pack has a compelling appearance . this beer is ultra pale in color . it will pour a huge head if you demand it ( pour hard ) , and it diminishes rather quickly ( like all beers of the type ) , although freshness seems to play a role .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : tame pour yields 3 fingers of head . cloudy , beautiful gold color , some particles on bottom . the head is tight and shapely .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : it was a little light looking , though of a good straw colour , actually kind of reminds me of apple cider , in terms of appearance . good level of carbonation , though not much of a head when poured into a glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : milky , creamy tan with a yellow hue . head all but disappeared after a few sips , but the carbonation was great throughout .	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : right from the start of the pour , massive off-white/tan head . clear red-amber body with lots of carbonation running around . impressive sheet lacing on the inside of the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : icky floatys . i & # 8217 ; m a fan of yeast in the glass and don & # 8217 ; t mind the taste at all , but this was just a bit too much . layers of thick globs of yeast on a fairly gentle pour , it just took a good bit away from my enjoyment of the brew . flavor : a light overall flavor . i noted cherry and chocolate notes .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : mostly clear golden amber color with a two-finger , creamy , white head that lasted more than a few minutes . nice lacing .	00000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : apple juice color with the same amount of carbonation and head that i 'd get if i actually poured apple juice into my duvel glass . an increasingly aggressive pour resulted in absolutely zero head and only an occasional random clump of carbonation that wandered listlessly to the surface . not a very encouraging start ...	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours black but not as thick as you would think it might be . it had a bit of good head to begin with but quickly died down . it only took a few moments for me to grab my camera before it was basically completely gone as you can see in the photograph . compared to other black lagers this one does n't have the appearance youd expect . absolutely no lacing ... zero . dissapointing really . this beer is n't much to look at . basically it 's a darker carbonated pepsi .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : moderate pour yields a 2.5 finger light , fine , milk chocolate head with good retention . beer is near opaque but as i hold it up to the light , i get a nice amber quality . lacing is spotty and string but with nice stick .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : super dark , clear amber with many bubbles . this is good .	000000000000000
0	a : pours a murky but clean burnt orange with a light white head , average retention , no head after a few minutes .	0000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a beautiful birch beer colored brew . small to medium sized head is light tan in color . leaves some lacing . moderate carbonation is visible . looks inviting .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured a rich dark brown that borders on black . head was a pillowing caramel color with toasted almond tinting . impressive and long lasting retention . lacing clung around the glass in chestnut hues . overall the appearance is noteworthy .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : head builds during pouring about as fast as it dissipates after finishing the pour . slightly brown but mainly white head . fizzles down to a slight ring with practically no lacing . orange brown color .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a pure white 3 finger head with a mostly clear pale gold body . retention is better than expected with even some moderate lacing .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : black body with clear red highlights under a thin head of coarse brown foam . pretty standard .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : one of the hazier blonde ales in the market , quite active carbonation holds the white lace together .	000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a crystal clear golden straw wuth a quickly dissipating frothy and soapy white head that leaves only a whispy ring .	000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a deep dark amber with a lot of cream colored foam on top of it .	0000000000000000000
0	a : little to no head . goldn color with standard wheat cloudiness .	00000000000000
0	appearance : cloudy brown . moderate off white head .	0000000000

0	appearance : dark beer , nothing out of the ordinary .	00000000000
1	a : clear , bright blonde with great carbonation . very pretty , with a lacy head .	000000000000000000
1	appearance : ruby red in color with a large and persistent off-white head , scattered patchy lacing with little carbonation . quite attractive in all .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dark cloudy amber , very dark for style , minimal head	000000000000000
0	appearance : looks like a still cider , with a cloudy apple juice color and no head or visible carbonation	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : gold-peach pour with an enormous head , took up 90 % of the glass	0000000000000000
0	a : clear , straw/yellow , medium carbonation . finger-width head with thickness and some lacing . not bad for a macrolager . 2/5	000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : slightly cloudy amber . big ass pillowy head with lots of thick lingering lacing . beautiful	000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours to a clear deep amber color with light foam that fades quickly with almost no lacing .	00000000000000000000
1	a : pours an extremely dark brown with a billowing light brown head that took forever to slowly fade into a thick oily film that left a beautiful sheet of sticky lacing down the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours an opaque black as dark as oil with a one-finger dark tan head . not too much retention or lacing here .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : a dark ruby with some darker hints of brown throughout . good sized tan head . eventually dies down with good lacing . head continues to cover through out . great looking beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : yellow straw with a very thin bubbly head that dissipated in matter of seconds . not even a slight ring was left . definitely not impressed .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : it looked like yellow sprite . it poured with a fluffy head reminiscent of soda pop but that faded pretty quick completely . meh .	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a amberish orange color with a small slightly off white foam head with not much retention . there is ample lacing .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : twist off cap . very carbonated , clear macro color . one inch of white head , which goes away with no lacing . bubbles cling to glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : well , we can definitely say packaging was everything here . sweet blue tinted bottle with black wrapped cork . small but after drinking it , i understand why . poured like a motor oil into my oil pan . no head no matter how much i tried . when held up to the light , hints of cherry coloring highlighted the absence of light .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : extremely pale . fizzy and foamy . little head retention .	0000000000000
1	appearance : this beer pours a jet black color , kind of like batman 's cape at midnight . ( do n't ask me where that came from ) when i hold the glass up to the light its not even letting the slightest amount pass through it . again , i reached for my trusty dogfish head snifter to enjoy this ale and i gave it yet another straight on pour to entice a creamy head but sadly i did n't get it . i have read many reviews about lost abbey 's big beer series and how they tend to have little to no head when poured . i always wondered if this was a habitual problem of just an intentional doing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : translucent ; slight yeast settling on the bottom of the glass due to being unfiltered .	000000000000000000
0	a : dark cloudy copper color . had to force a head that poured white , but it did n't hold . thin lacing slid down the side of the glass and faded .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : hazy redish , brown with a 1.5 inch thick and steady head ; lacing is decent	000000000000000000
0	a : pours a mostly opaque brownish-black with russet highlights . 1-finger head settles quickly and leaves no lacing .	00000000000000000000
0	a : slightly hazy golden . pours with minimal head . not exactly beautiful , but it works .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : watered-down urine	0000
0	a : pours a shinny dark brown with a thin white head , which does not last very long . leaves little lacing .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : the honey porter had a dark body with a 1-finger creamy beige head that made the beer look like candy . it pours beautifully and keeps it 's head throughout .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : excellent - clear copper coloured beer with a super fluffy belgian style head which never seems to fade and laces all down the glass .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours dark brown , with the slightest ruby tinge around the edges of the pint . disappointing small head that disappears immediately .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : slightly cloudy , straw gold . little head .	00000000000
1	appearance : light black colour with some deep ruby highlights when put against the light . head : dark beige colour , moussy and moderately low . it fades rather quickly but successfully maintains a little bit of the foam as the beer is consumed . good amount of lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the beer pours a very bubbly bright golden color , its somewhat hazy , and have a wonderfully thick white head and awesome lacing , perfect looking beer ...	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : perfect . pitch black with a thick mocha colored head that fades perfectly .	0000000000000000
1	appearance : a brilliant , quarter-inch thick white head rested on top of a slightly opaque , deep copper beer . it looked very rich and the lacing was very impressive with a ton of glass coverage all the way around except for the side i was drinking from .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : piss colored beer ; it looks like every other cheap light beer , yellow and very carbonated .	00000000000000000000
1	a : pours with an overflowing foam head that took several minutes to dissipate . it also poured jet black , in which no light could be shown through .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : rich deep amber coloring with nice frothy head that stuck around for a little bit . really nice looking brew .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : pours black with 2.5 fingers worth of tan creamy head . settles to a nice cap and left a decent amount of lacing on the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a citrus golden color with an incredible , thick , chunky , rocky , billowing white head that took its sweet time to die down into a thick film that left chunks and sheets of sticky lacing down the side of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : light amber beer with a white , disappearing head . no lacing .	000000000000000
0	a : pours a turbid copper ale with less than a single finger of light peanut foam . this dissipates rather quickly to a mirror surface and a central cap of foam . no lacing . surprised at how turbid this is .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pale copper , no head , light carbonation , no lacing	0000000000000
0	a : pours brown , dark brown with a transient finger of light latte head . this leaves an etched surface with a ringlet left . no lace .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : awesome ! mostly clear golden color with a touch of orange in the light ; abundant puffy white head that lasts and some great lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : black , opaque with nice thick head that holds up pretty well .	000000000000000
0	appearance : this selection pours as a hazy honey color . head is moderately thin but with good sustain . nothing special here .	000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : i ca n't think of a single thing to take away from this . poured with two fingers of creamy head that both sustained and laced well . the beer itself is everything i 'd expect a red ale to be , and nice deep and dark crimson and the body boasts good carbonation with no signs of sediment .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a turbid goldenrod capped with off-white foam . the murkiness is a distinct turnoff ; even a careful pour could n't avoid it , so i do n't think it 's sediment .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a very pale ipa ... hazy , pillow white head , more on the golden yellow side . nice retention on the head with some pretty lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours with a think , dense head with great retention -- the color of the head reminds me of the froth of a cappuccino . the rest is a semiopaque light brown/copper .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark reddish amber in color , slightly hazy , and a nice one finger tan head of foam .	000000000000000000000
1	a : beautiful pour ... the head formed in a strange rumbling way ... deceptively clear reddish-brown color.. one finger white head ... lacing is sticky as glue , doesnt want to leave the sides ... i can already tell the carbonation is going to be unique from the way it bubbles up	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : very nice golden color with a large fluffy long lasting head . lacing all down the glass .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : gold with a slight haze and a 1/4 '' white head on the pour ... .looks ok	0000000000000000000
1	a : very nice pinky of white bubbly head and leaving huge legs of lacing . orange semi clear look . s/t : interesting and certainly not characteristic of an ipa in both smell and taste . at first i likened it to a style from a brewery an hour north in jolly pumpkin because of the dirty farmhouse belgian yeasty saison notes and the dry and crisp malts of a biere de garde . some fruity hops but not much . just a bubblegum like taste and smell overall with maybe a tinge of tartness , though perhaps thats my palate putting that in there since the malts and yeast seem like tartness would be welcomed here . not oxidized to my palate , just an off recipe and style .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : the appearance started of on the wrong foot as i am pouring along normally , getting minimal head , i increase the speed of my pour as i near the end of the beer , then ... panic , `` shit ! what is that ! '' comes out of my mouth . there are big thick disgusting looking white chunks of an unknown substance that are floating in this beer . i am not new to bottle conditioned beers . i often enjoy adding the yeast . this is not that type of matter . it is flaky dandruff that is quite unappealing . nonetheless , i got over it and moved on . if you eliminate the mysterious substance , the rest of the appearance is decent . its a light orange almost peach colored beer with a small off white head and nice lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a very cloudy orange color . nasty cloudy for a non homebrew . has stuff floating all thoroughout it . seen live beers before , but this is new . looks like more like unfiltered trub than dead yeasties , its all throughout the beer . glass was clean , had just washed it . whatever it is came from the bottle . needless to say cloudy beer with floating crap inside doent quite help the score . only saving grace is that it poured with nice head and great lace !	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : 3 |	0000
0	a : very dark brown with only a mild amount of head on top . no lacing present either which is dissappointing	0000000000000000000000
1	a : nice dense off white head with good retention . dark maple red colour with some haze .	0000000000000000000
1	a : straw blonde , nice thick head , loads of carbonation	000000000000
1	a : drab apricot juice colored brew , hazy as hell . well carbonated , the beer was in a hurry to get out of the bottle . it produced a very nice rocky top head ... i mean very nice and it lasted the entire beer . great looking beer in my opinion .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured from bottle into pint glass . color was dark brown but translucent in the light . virtually no head and zero lacing .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : i am a sucker for the cascading with nitro beers , especially a stout . this looked great -- 1 minute cascading left an opaque , black beer with a 2 finger tan head . lots of lacing with permanent rings from every gulp .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : hm.. i wish i didnt have to do it , but when i opened my bottle , the head slowly started growing out , like a mutant brain or alien slime in a 50s horror film . took quite a while to pour the whole thing , as it left behind a nice , if massive , off white rocky head . probably the nicest ( if also excessive ) feature in the appearance , as the body was a murky , almost opaque brown , not too unlike the bottom of a jug of cider . oh well .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : one finger khaki colored head , quick to diminish . murky body with a rustic orange color . spare lacing .	00000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a cloudy , lake water brown color with almost no head . maybe one or two spots of lacing . pretty pitiful appearance for an imperial stout .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : big rocky head with great retention . bright light yellow body , and nice lacing .	000000000000000000

0	a : this beer pours a very average watery black that one has become accustomed to with a low-ish abv stout . nothing special . an off-white head that laces well , but does n't get as sticky as some beers do . you would n't think this would be one of the best pumpkin beers ever conceived by looking at it .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : poured from a limited release chubby 12oz , the color is a nice deep amber brown with a translucent appearance and a bunch o carbonation bubbles . the head is a whopping 2 1/2 finger length head that retains its whole way down the glass leaving behind a sticky residue .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : supremely dark with a beautiful tan head and some good lacing down the side of the glass . this is what all porters should look like .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : medium golden colored with slight green notes . did she dye her hair a few months ago ? the head is most disappointing , a solid inch foams up , sounding like a soda poured over ice , and then it quickly fades away , leaving the beer wearing next to nothing . cat call ! there is a very mild haze that does not detract from the appearance .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : looks like thick motor oil as it 's poured . this is one dark mofo . opaque , pitch black , with a creamy brown head with good retention . it 's the colour that makes this though .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : i was n't planning on reviewing this beer yet ... until i poured it . the initial pour was beautiful . an opaque brown , only shades from black with a huge creamy tan head . a nice web of lacing follows every sip .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : as i grabbed the cork to pull it out it immediately broke off in my hand ( without much force i might add ) , and when i tried to screw a corkscrew into the remaining cork in the bottle the cork just fell down into the beer , so we 're off to a good start . the beer itself is flat , which is n't a huge surprise . the color is similar to motor oil , black with murky brown edges , and it 's just as greasy looking . it turns out having a piece of the cork in the bottle was a good thing because it prevented most of the sediment from entering my glass . in fact , i did n't know just how much crap was left in the bottle until i went to rinse it out . the liquid that was left came out like sewage , full of chunks and sludge . also , it turns out the bottle is clear blue and not black ! who knew ? there was a thick black crust covering the entire inside of the bottle that broke free into shards as i rinsed it free . glad i did n't get any of that crap in my glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : a beautiful dark red amber . magnificent head with surprisingly creaminess and retention . good lacing .	0000000000000000000
0	a : opaque , jet black , no head	000000000
0	appearance : fizzy carbonation leads to a soda like look as the head virtually disappears in the matter of seconds . tiny particles float around and put a thin robe of haze around the beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : amber hues are fused with golds and yellows around the edges . i poured cautiously and yet the head was incredibly eager to form . it did so in an out of control manner . to be honest , the densely foamed cream white cap was rather impressive and lasting . my glass was coated with streaks and spiderwebbing as a result . high marks for the head and lace	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : very dark yet lucid yellow and gold hue . lots of lacing , very spread out but prominent in its size and shape . does n't actually look as good as it tastes which is mostly a rare situation imo .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazed orange with a bit of particulate that can be seen . head is a bit disappointing , off-white half inch sized head dies quickly without very good retention . and it aint the glass . some lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a very dark brown with about a finger of light tan head which recedes into a nice , thick layer with some good lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a cloudy light amber color with a finger of fluffy white head , that seems very fitting . the head dissipates leaving just a layer . pretty beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : absolutely gorgeous pour into a pint glass . nice cascading effect , with a good 3/4 inch of a thick , creamy head . unfortunately everything good ends here .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a golden orange color , which was not similar to much i 've seen before , beautiful certainly . the head was slightly less impressive , tight and pale - about 1/2 '' and diminished quickly .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : as i begin to pour this beer straight into the tulip , i notice that there does n't appear to be any carbonation . i pour from higher up . nothing . higher still . nada . i dumb the last ounce of beer in with some force behind it , and finally get about half an inch of huge white bubbles to show up , but they do n't stay long . this one looks to be completely uncarbonated , and to make matters worse the medium-amber body is absolutely awash with huge chunks of swirling particulate . i 'm sure i dislodged some with my rough pour , but this amount is seriously unnerving . this makes even the most unfiltered of ipas look crystal clear . definitely one of the least appealing brews i 've ever seen , but i 'll bump it up a half-point for being a nice color for the style .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a cloudy copper color , with a small off-white head , but fluffy with huge and tiny bubbles . moderate lacing .	0000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : this beer had been in the back of a friend 's fridge for at least a year . needless to say , there were hefty chunks of sediment floating around the glass , but these dissipated as the beer was swirled around .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this has a starkly different appearance from the regular version ( served side by side ) . this has a clear copper color with a perfect natural creamy foam head 2 inches high .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a tiny froth of head struggles to form and is having an even harder time retaining or forming lace anywhere on the pint . the body is amber with ruby hues .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy yellow , huge fluffy white head . extra chunky .	0000000000000
0	appearance : light yellow , to basically clear , even more clear than others	00000000000000
1	a : the beer poured a nice fizzy yellow pale color with a small white head which had decent lacing ...	000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pale cloudy body with a sticky white head .	00000000000
0	appearance : dark to medium amber color . not quite dark enough to call it a porter . and the head was good , for about 2 minutes .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : 1/2 '' off white head , clumpy skim foam . looks like apple cider , kinda cloudy , hard to see through , rich amber	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a hazy , straw yellow with two fingers of white head that recedes into a foamy ring with no lacing .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : pale yellow with a small white head .	0000000000
1	appearance : it poured a very deep ruby red color . looks almost black . it had a huge beautiful head that lasted a while . it settled to a thin layer of foam with a beautiful lace .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pitch black . 2 finger khaki/cream head . sticky lacy down the glass .	0000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a clear copper , with lots of tiny bubbles running quickly to the surface . despite the bubbles , not much head to speak of , though what little there was stuck around and laced nicely .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : nice clear golden colour with a tight creamy head .	000000000000
1	a : pours a darker opaque yellow-orange into my piraat tulip glass with a rock-solid white head that leaves the glass clean as it moves down slowly .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : rich leathery brown to black , with a nice 1.25 finger head . minimal lacing remains throughout my tasting .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : deep redish color , absolutely gorgeous to look at .	000000000000
1	a : pours a clear golden-orange body . 1 '' frothy head slowly fades to a thick frothy film . a large stream of medium sized carbonation bubbles rise from the center of the glass at a rapid rate .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : black in color with khaki colored head with a nice 2 inch head . this beer is the quintessential ris in appearance . great looking beer .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a slightly murky amber with copper tones when held to the light . the first pour yields a fluffy off-white head that covers the top 1.5 '' of the glass . retention is substantial , so much that i actually notice the head sticking around and preventing me from dipping into the beer . as it recedes into a light cap on the brew , it leaves a sticky web of dense lacing down the sides of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : bright gold , lots of rising carbonation , single finger head . uniform coated lacing .	000000000000000000
1	appearance : glowing , hazy , burnt orange in color with a decent amount of carbonation and a healthy amount of lacing around the edge .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : this pours a dark red color with lots of sediment and a thick , one-finger , creamy head that is quite typical with bottle conditioning . it also has considerable lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : brightest , yellowest beer possible . the glass is more opaque than the contents . huge loose head that vanishes almost instantly leaving absolutely no lacing , and not even a ring of cover . the color is decent , the head is blasphemous .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a hazy light copper with a bubbly white head . no lacing .	0000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a pleasant clear amber color , with 2 fingers of foamy head in my darkness tulip . as the head begins to recede , sticky lacing clings to the edge of the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : the label reads `` batch # 11/2009/bottle # 437 ; i am a sucker for stuff like that . it pours a dark , somewhat reddish amber . a moderately rough pour produces only a smallish off-white head , but man ...	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : looks like a glass of ice tea but with nice head	0000000000000
1	a : pours a completely translucent wheat yellow like you 'd expect from any other lager , with a stark white and foamy three finger head . plenty of carbonation flowing up toward the top of the glass . an impressive amount of lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : really nice amber-peach color , decent amount of light head . really beautiful .	0000000000000000
0	a : pours orange , amber color . minimal to no head upon pouring .	000000000000000
0	appearance : i thought it was a little dark for a marzen . it was brown with a nice off white head and lace .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a murky mud brown with a huge , massive tan head . it looks like cola . constant stream of fuzzy bubbles rise from the start .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy , reddish brown . pours with zero head . again with this total lack of carbonation from lost abbey . not sure why this continues to be a trend . not a particularly attractive brew .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : light orangish yellow in color . very hazy . half finger head that disappears instantly . hardly any lacing .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a hazy orange-yellow with three fingers of white head that recedes into a thin ring with no lacing .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : wow . props to bells ' for this beautiful single ipa . it has a hazy orange/amber color with three plus fingers of foamy , rocky white head . it 's enormous and has great retention . very dramatic lacing goes down my entire sa perfect pint glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a very clear pale light yellow that was surprisingly the lightest colored beer i have experienced . head lasted about 3 seconds before breaking apart .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a slightly orange/yellow beer with active carbonation from the bottom to top . the head is a generous 3 '' of slightly yellow , foamy , craterous head . it has excellent retention and leaves plenty of spidery lace on the glass . a picturesque beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : i feel like these guys do a great job with head ; this one is thick and tightly bubbled and sits on top of a clear amber body	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a clear copper color with a small whitish head that recedes quickly .	000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a very yellowy-brown , with a decent-sized head . color is a bit light for a `` dark '' beer , though that often happens with belgians .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : when poured from a 12 once bottle into a pint glass i see a very small head , though the pour was rather vigorous . this ipa is a bit lighter in color than some other ipa 's i drink , more of an orange like color , rather than the dark and amber of say a 90 min . the appearance seams to suggest a hoppier more bitter beer rather than the maltiness of the aforementioned .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : served with 1/2 a finger of off-white head that quickly disappears . not even a film or collar . the body is a radiant amber orange with 80 % transparency . absolutely no lacing . s &	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured very tank , with a quickly dissipating *very* thin head . no lacing present whatsoever . closer inspection reveals a ruby red color when held up the light .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : very , very light golden yellow with a 1 inch qhite head that very quickly fades to a small lace atop the brew . good .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : slightly hazy gold color . poured a 1 finger white head that fell quickly to a broken skim that clung on the edges . inconsistent , broken lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : major foam in my flute . an amber golden body with a very long lasting head and major lacing . perfect appearance in my books .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a cloudy amber orange with a finger of head . lacing towards the top of the glass .	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this brew pours wonderful tan full head . lacings are insanely plentiful . can you believe it ? i swear even the head had lacings ! ! ! that was a first for me ! ( even being a homebrewer that would be a noble goal ) color is a deep reddish brown . carbonation is average for american ales but a little high for english styles .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : light golden color . not much of a head with very little lacing .	0000000000000000
0	appearance : this was a hazy , straw colored beer . the head was tiny and disappeared instantly , just like a soda . there was no trace of it left at all .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy , murky orangeish brown color . had ample amount of foamy off-white head . tons of white / cream colored sediment suspended throughout and also gathered at the bottom of the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : nice golden color , two fingers of white lush foam , good head retention , great clarity , lacey	000000000000000000000
0	a : deep amber-gold , small head with very thin lace . incredibly hazy with suspended chunks . i really looked for something to indicate that this was intended but i can not find anything . hopefully a one batch thing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy gold . big white head that has stuck with it . little patches of lacing down the side of the glass . minimal/no carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the pour gives you blend of rich , dark brown color streaked with cream , then the cascading effect kicks in ( cascading from a can = awesome ! ) . once the cascading settles , you 're left with a deep , opaque brown body and a thick , ultra creamy , khaki colored head , two fingers thick - it looks as if someone has poured a layer of creamy vanilla milkshake over top of my guinness .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pale glowing amber body forms a thin cream head which dwindles rather quickly leaving little or no lacing , carbonation issues well maybe .	00000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : looks like budweiser .	000000
1	a : love the golden look to this beer , when poured it held a semi thick head for longer than what i thought it would ( 2-3 min ) and it laced really nice . logo rocks too .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pour is very light in color - looks almost like an adjunct lager . the white head is pretty large , but sinks quickly into no lacings .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a murky shade of brown , sort of like a watered down cheap coffee , the head was brown and thin .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : must have been sitting on the bar for a while . by the time it got to me , there was no head to speak of , just some foam floating .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours an ultra-clear straw color with some massive head that fades slowly . moderate carbonation . n : pale malts , grass and lemon .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a super murky redish brown with a small white head that fades to a ring pretty quickly leaving no real lacing on the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours , glugs , out super thick , black as night . very little head chocolate milk head , only there for a couple of seconds .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured into a nonic glass , this beautiful enough to frame and hang up on the wall . a rich black beer that is impenetrable by light shares the glass with an equally rich inch high head . the head subsides to practically nothing with a bit of lace .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : not much head ; what there is disappears almost immediately . there was a significant amount of yeast in the bottle , some of which made it into the glass . this probably contributed to the cloudiness of the beer . color is muddy brown with a red/orange highlights .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : light brown with cranberry red hues in the colour . the head was awesome at first with a big fluffy and think meringue look , unfortunately it dissipated to almost nothing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a nice thumb and a half of head that produced solid lacing . the body is a bright yellow that has a very fine amount of particulate yeast that i would expect from the style and ample carbonation . excellent retention as well , all 's it needs is a bit more lace .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours with the whitest head imaginable . only one finger high but the retention is amazing . the head starts out fluffy , becomes fizzy , and lands on creamy as it is constantly being fed by a relentless rush of bubbles . sea foam style lace is immaculate and sticks to the glass in sheets . the body is perfectly clear and the typical light honeycomb yellow pilsner color . perfect appearance , no questions asked .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a deep copper , clear , with nearly 3 fingers of a tight white head with really good retention . leaves a lot of lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : orangish amber in color . quarter inch head . sporadic lacing . not impressive .	00000000000000000
1	a : pours a gorgeous deep orangey/yellow color that reminds me of a fire . nice 1 1/2 finger head too with great lacing on the glass . it does n't get much better than this .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : golden red in color and a bit cloudy with a significant amount of large sediment . unappetizing .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a pretty dull and lifeless color , sort of a chalky amber . a fast-fading almost-white head tops this one and leaves nothing but a sheen of foam once it fades . lacing is splotchy and inconsistent , runny and glittery . carbonation is fast and fine-bubbled , incredibly dense . a strange-looking beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear poor into a snifter , generates ample , white , head that dissipates quickly and leaves minimal lacing . the beer is a dark red/amber color	00000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pale yellow , like easter egg yellow that 's diluted . lackluster head disappeared . now there 's a thin , thin , thin ring of white .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : hazy orange , very cloudy and active . tons of foamy white head everywhere . its great retention leaves a sticky trace of white lace behind .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : one finger of an oppwhite head and pours a dark brown but a lot of light penetrates . i like my imperial stouts pitch black .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark like a black iced coffee . small white head that dissapates quickly	000000000000000
1	appearance : deep black pour with a tan pancake batter head . the head slowly fades and sticks to the glass .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : as poured the beer is a dark brown , almost black , liquid with a 1 light brown head composed of lots of medium and small sized bubbles . as the beer slowly but visibly recedes it leaves some foam around the sides of the glass and some leggy lacing sticking to the glass . sipping creates a line of a ring that arches over lots of small speckles of lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours an orangey-copper body with a lush , frothy white head . very nice lookin ' .	0000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours into my delirium tulip a pitch black with a one and a half finger high , loose-bubbled , light brown head . this is one of the biggest heads i 've ever seen on an imperial stout . it has nice staying power too and leaves wall of lacing down the glass . can i give this a 5.5 ? or 8.0 ?	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours an orangish copper color with a thick finger of head that dissipates but a nice foam film remains .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : almost 4 fingers of head . great etching lacing . tons of yeast floating with the carbonation . i have never seen so much yeast in a dipa .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a very dark brown with hints of red . one inch lasting creamy looking tan head .	00000000000000000000
1	a : pours an orange color w/ 3 fingers of head . very foamy , big bubbles dissipate slowly .	00000000000000000000
0	a : typical saison . cloudy light-gold color with a fluffy , white head .	000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a cloudy yellow-brown , carbonation is on the lighter side , very little foam and no lacing .	000000000000000000000
0	a : standard pour yields a thin barely-there layer of light mocha that dissipates quickly . beer is an appropriate opaque black . lacing is minimal with no stick . nice legs though . head and lacing lose points that the legs make up for a touch . slightly below average . hardly carbonated .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : golden body with thick clouds and no head , lacing , or cover . lots of floating particulate matter as well . pretty poor really , but this could easily be a carbonation issue due to a defect in the rubber seal .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : rusty copper-tone amber , light orange pigment on the bottom , darkened rubber-oaken look ; a a very cupidinously froth-craze , masterful lace -- powerful sell . score ! adil , hoy definitely know how to pick ... from light session , to strong seasonal , this makes your mark .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : slightly hazy , medium orangish-gold color with over one finger of lofty , cottony white foam that diminishes to a persistent iceberg covering over half of the surface . heavy lacing , showing obvious relief in places , remains on the glass . a few bubbles rise lazily in the column .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a fairly vigorous pour results in two full fingers of creamy tan head atop a crystal-clear , dark mahogany body . amazing retention and lacing for an 11 % beer . color me impressed .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : painfully clear light yellow with a short lived large bubbled head . flavor : very sweet , cloying , with the main flavors being corn and corn syrup . no agave flavors noted ( and this from a fairly dedicated tequila drinker ) but a fair shot of lime straight from one of those green plastic limes .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this is the beers shining moment . the body of the beer is a bright shining caramel amber coloration . the head of the beer looks a creamy caramel tinged off white . no real head retention but not expected for the abv . the beer is wearing a wonder bra . now you may ask what brings a wonder bra to mind ? you think your girl has a great rack and she takes her bra off and you wonder where her tits went . the beer looks like its got a great rack but leave me wondering what the hell happened ?	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : not the most attractive looking beer . black , with no sign of carbonation yet again ( see my past lost abbey reviews for more on the lack of carbonation ) . it could have been sitting out all night for all i know -- that 's what it looked like .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : it looked like beer , gold , no head , slightly fizzy	00000000000000

1	a : pours a beautiful moderately hazy amber color . there is a foamy head of 2 fingers with amazing retention . on the side of the glass in the head , i can see a lot of small bubbles stacked on top of each other like jelly beans in a jar . as the head fades , it looks even creamier and small pockets reminiscent of the lunar surface appear on top of the still thick head .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : first non-gusher of the upland lambics that i have had . pours a creamy purple . little foam , but the foam that is there is a purplish-white . beautiful looking beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : cloudy . slight head . light tan .	0000000000
0	a : light gold , pale yellow edges . thin white head , no retention .	0000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a crystal clear pale straw colour with a medium bone white head , quickly receding to nothing . no lace whatsover .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark amber with a nice white head , good retention .	000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a cloudy amber color with very little off white head that disappears completely . not very attractive .	000000000000000000000
0	appearance : hazy golden glass does n't hold much of a head , just a thin coat that does n't lace . the thin head dropped off about half way through leaving a murky yellow glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : cloudy with a pale light orange colour . no floating yeast . the head is white , moussy and substantial . it seldom persists and when it goes away it leaves very little lacing behind .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a mirky , orangish yellow . a couple fingers of foam and lots of lacings	000000000000000000
0	appearance : a one finger foamy and bubbly white head with poor retention . this style of beer needs to have a lasting head . the color of the beer is an amber color with copper orange hues . there is some effervescence in the beer . the clarity of the beer is clear to brilliant .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pale yellow . rolling active carbonation . descent white bubbly head with slightly above average . s/t : i can not get over how much this beer smells and tastes like buttered popcorn . i think this is diacetyl in the beer . i am not sure if this is intended but it is not disguised by any amount of malt or hop character . if you read the back of this bottle , you might be expecting a traditional lager in the german style and this stuff makes bud taste better .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours yellow-orange , with a light head and carbonation , good colour .	000000000000000
0	appearance : well , i thought i was really careful with my pour and dumped an ounce or so from the bottom , but ended up with lots -- lots of suspended yeast in my glass . it doesnt really alter my enjoyment that much , but it looks kinda gross . otherwise i think it would be clear ruby-orange with a nice head that leaves sheets and sheets of lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : frothy 2-finger head . the color is a pale gold .	0000000000000
1	a : an initially careless pour explodes into a mountain of froth , and even slowing down to a slanted trickle does n't let me get the whole beer poured right away . once things settle down a bit , a creamy , rocky tan head sits atop a murky reddish-brown body . while the clarity is n't what i would like and it appears a bit overcarbonated , i 'm still a fan . what can i say ? i 'm in love with lots of head .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : was a hazy amber/ straw color in appearance , slight eggshell head with minimal lacing .	000000000000000000
0	a : it poured a pale greenish yellow clear body with a mountain of bubbles from carbonation but a minor white head . the head was gone before i sat down and did not support much more than itty bitty clumps of lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : it pours a light yellow with a head that fades like that of coke poured into a glass . i could n't be more unimpressed .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a deep mahogany-brown and is capped with sudsy , short-lived khaki head . it quickly resembles root beer .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured a beautiful hazy light ruby red color with a very thin head of foam . it did n't leave too much lace but did have some rings around my pilsner glass . although a nice color , but to me it is n't the usual dopplebock dark brown/ruby/black color .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours an ugly muddy brown color with a half finger of fluffy white head . +.5 point for the beady lace on the glass .	000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : an excellent white cappuccino-like froth that remained throughout the whole drink . unfiltered with a lot of yeast that did not take long to settle after the pour .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pretty brown . lots of yeast suspended . not a very atractive beer . small tannish head , that receeded quickly and left little lace .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a deep inviting reddish brown with a tan head	00000000000
1	a : 3 fingers of frothy tan head over a fine looking black , featuring brown edges when held up to the light . there 's a nice froth of retention and good lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : fluffy banana milkshake head , thin dull gold with minimal rising carbonation	00000000000000
1	a : brilliantly red in color with a crisp foamy white head , sticks to the glass like no other - and perfectly clear .	0000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours with a big rocky white head which takes a while to dissipate . follow that is a rocky white lacing that clings to the glass . cloudy and light amber in color .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : amber colored beer , clear with great frothy head	00000000000

0	a : pours light brown with amber notes - surprisingly light . a very small head dissipates instantly leaving no lacings .	0000000000000000000000

0	appearance : dark brown but not 100 % opaque . no head.no lacing .	00000000000000
1	a : pours a golden clear body with a light white head that lasted better than expected with light lacing .	000000000000000000000
0	a : dark orange with red hues . looks like a cloudy irish red . not sure why this lager is not clear ( wheat maybe ) ... who knows . creamy off-white head that left pretty quickly . no significant lacing	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : very cloudy walnut brown . a fizzy cream head starts out strong , but quickly disappears . leaves no lace .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : clear light golden color with a big foamy head , about 2 fingers worth . the head dissipated slowly settling to a nice layer leaving lots of lacing all the way down . great looking beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a medium 1 finger off-white head that 's thick and full looking . higher carbonation evident . dark brown in color , almost black , which some ruby hues around the edges . head slowly recedes and leaves some immediate lacing . a nice film stays and decent lacing down the glass . pretty nice looking .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : very clear , slight golden hue ; fizzy white head , no retention or lace .	000000000000000000

1	a : pours copper , with a large soapy tan head . slow dissipation and rich lacings .	000000000000000000
0	appearance : brownish caramel , with just a thin head that tapered off quite quickly .	0000000000000000
1	appearance : looks just like a guiness on nitro ; great lacing	000000000000
1	a : crystal clear , nice head that sticks around well . the head really surprised and impressed me , have n't seen a commercial pale ale that sticks around this long .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours black with a small fizzy off-white head , good retention , light lacing .	00000000000000000
0	a : clear , amber color , no head	000000000
1	appearance : out of the bottle it pours a clear amber reminiscent of cognac . no carbonation , head or lacing , but it does have a sticky look to it as it holds on to the sides of the snifter and slowly rolls down . beautiful . aroma 2 : still highly alcoholic , but also reminiscent of cognac , port , with nutty tones of pecans and hazelnuts and a sort of sugary sweetness . the alcohol really dries out your nose ! flavor : still amazed that this is a beer ! warming , alcoholic up front and notes of caramel and vanilla . it ends with the nuttiness described above .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a cloudy orange beer that pours with a huge white head . that fizzles away relatively fast .	00000000000000000000
1	appearance : a lovely pink with tints of orange . tons of little bubbles shooting up to the surface , especially in the middle .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured an orangish copper color with good carbonation leaving a tan cap . pretty cloudy too	000000000000000000

1	a : pours a deep strawberry/blood red color . 1/4 inch pink head with nice retention .	00000000000000000
1	appearance : when it was first poured , it was black on top and brown on the bottom . when it settled it went with the jet black color with a small amount of ruby highlights . it had a creamy tan colored head of foam the measured somewhere between 1 to 2 inches that left lots of lace . when first poured , i also saw the carbonation bubbles pop on top of the foam . a true delight !	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : no surprises here : it 's thick , black , and opaque with two fingers of solid , frothy brown head that sticks around admirably and leaves some nice lace . you ca n't ask for anything more from an ris .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear yellow body with only vague remnants of a thin white head . insipid .	00000000000000000
1	a : pours a deep , rich brown color which looks black , other than the highlights around the edges . the pour produces a fluffy billowy khaki color head that retains well and leaves lots of lacing along the glass	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured into a goblet fairly aggressive , revealing a nice off-white/cream colored head resting on a deep caramel colored liquid . bubbles continued to rise from the bottom of the glass as i waited impatiently to drink . good amount of lacing left on the glass . head retention was good .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : looks more like a belgian than a stout ( as i would expect from ommegang ) with an espresso brown color and a rich , foamy head that leaves plenty of lacing	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : my biggest ding on this beer is the appearance . i like the color , an orangish yellow color but ... blue moon calls this a belgian white but it 's not anywhere near white ! ! not true to style . reclassify the beer to match the style ...	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : transparent light yellow in color . practically no head and light lace .	000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a cloudy brown color with some reddish tints . head is just a thin off-white film that does n't last long . some visible carbonation and lots of floating sediment ( that does n't seem to settle ) .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a light amber , one finger white head which dissipates quickly . clear .	00000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a golden orange color with a very tall 5 '' cream colored head . it has great retention and gods of clinging , spidery lace . deep craters are formed in the head .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured in to a german tumbler only to watch it explode with foam . after the pour , the off-white head slowly climbed over an inch above the rim of the glass . i am quite impressed with the vigorous lacing presented through a crystal clear , amber body .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a hazy amber to orange hue , with little carbonation that settles to a thin film on the surface . head retention is mediocre , and lacing is the same . i understand this is an unfiltered ipa , but the amount of floaties turns me off .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : this beer was a reddish-orange color with just a little bit of haze . hardly any head at all and , therefore , no lace .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : looks good , nearly black ( some faint red hues shine through ) and but a smaller than normal head ...	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : at least 4 inches of thick , creamy , dense head of a light brown color . excellent head retention . left a solid foamy film all around the glass and well down the sides . superb head ! deep chocolate brown color .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pouring into a pint glass out of the can is a beautiful thing to see and you can watch the nitro head just settle out on top . very deep gold/straw in color . with more bubbles clinging to the side of my glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a beautiful orange-brown but cloudy , damn near opaque even upon warming . the pour was good with a 0.5-1 inch head .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a light cloudy straw with a thick frothy head .	0000000000000
0	a : pours a deep and dark plum color with a very small , thin head . zero lacing and poor retention . the color is rich and nice , but the lack of a quality head is a bit disappointing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : modest head , little carbonation , clear dark ruddy red color	0000000000000

1	appearance : this beer is extremly dark , with a very thick long lasting tan head . when held up to a light very little if any light comes though this wonderful stout .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy straw color , with yeast sediment in suspension . long lasting creamy white head .	000000000000000000
1	a : very dark , black almost all the way through , except for the ruby red around the edges . nitrogen creates extremely small bubbles that create a tan head that lasts forever . excellent lasing . no carbonation .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : an attractive cascade dancing through the darkness to coalesce into a half inch of heavy mocha foam . a good start !	000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a transparent pinkish/straw color that produces virtually no head . not too impressed with the pour	0000000000000000000
1	a : muddy black , supple tan head that left some great lacing and a moderate cap throughout the tasting .	000000000000000000000
0	a : dark , dark brown ... almost a black . thin head that soon disappears as soon as it was poured .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy woody color beneath a thin film of a head . served in a chilled pint glass .	00000000000000000000
1	a : it has a golden amber to orange looking color .	000000000000
1	appearance : a slightly oversized pint glass is recommended . the nitro-can pours beautifully , filling the glass with microbubbles as it builds a thick creamy head . the head , about one finger thick , lasts for a long time , leaving heavy foam all down the glass as you drink . the color , after the microbubbles clear , is a light brown .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : really pale yellow color with some soda like bubbles on top .	00000000000000
1	a : brown red colour and a big 3 cm head that lasts pretty well . 5	00000000000000000
1	a : the most noticeable aspect is this brew 's creamy head that boasts a beige hue . its retention is admirable ; i 've had this beer in front of me for 20 minutes and it has n't diminished a bit . body is deep caramel in color with a touch of haze .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : black as you can get of of the darkest ive seen . light brown/ tanned head small streams of bubbles flowing up the side of the glass . wonderfull head and retention . perfect lacing in a symetrical pattern . perfect .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : roasted malts , bitter-sweet chocolate , dark fruits , some oats , a tinge of coffee , a dash of pepper , and a spice of alcohol . quite pleasant to the olfactory sense , if i do say so myself .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : clear pale yellow color . had a thick ( +1 '' ) head , but the foam looked like soap suds , not creamy . the head quickly fell to a ring which left little lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a one finer head of fair cream , decent thickness , and bad retention ( ~ fifteen seconds ) , though with this high an abv it 's remarkable it has a head at all . colour is a murky hazy nontransparent caramel butterscotch . yeasty bits float about . sm : raisin , dark fruit ( grape ) esters , dark fermented apple juice/cider , yeast , caramelized malt , and maybe molasses . there 's certainly a sweetness , but also a funky note i ca n't quite put my finger on . i can smell it from a distance , but up close it 's merely moderately strong . all around it 's certainly an intriguing aroma . i 'm enticed .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a light golden straw color with a dismal ring of a head and leaves behind just a light dusting of a lacing .	00000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : this poured a dark brown , almost black , with a nice frothy head . not much in the way of lacing though . you definitely could not see through the glass , it was dark ... it looked like coffee , imagine that .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured into a snifter . not head , even with a free , steady pour . this looks like a classic brown ale . actually , i had a 1985 version that was more ruby . this looks like a translucent brown ale . very unexpected . nothing wrong with the appearance , just uninspiring .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : watched the super carbonated porter make a huge mess all over my coffee table . massive head , no lacing .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : deep , dark reddish amber color . a quarter-finger of light beige head retains poorly and turns into a thin , big-bubbled collar with no lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pitch black with cola edging . a fluffy tan head with moderate retention .	0000000000000000
0	a : pours a glassy , crystal clear pale ochre with a half-finger head of fizzy , soapy bubs . they remain a thin , scummy top layer .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : clear amber with a big solid head that falls quickly .	0000000000000
0	appearance : clumpy sediment in a cloudy brown body , head fades at a very fast , fizzy rate . kind of an ugly looking beer .	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : very cloudy and opaque golden/yellow tinted brew . short , mildly off-white head with some moderate lacing .	00000000000000000000
1	appearance : cloudy pale white-golden color with a typical wheat beer tiny lace .	00000000000000
1	a : pours with an absolutely amazing 4 finger light tan head that seems to defy gravity , it refuses to drop , when it does , the head seems to get even thicker and never completely disappears . the beer it self is completely black as would be expected . the amount of lace is extreme , almost impossible to see through .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : bright yellow/goldish color with great transparency , tons of rising carbonation and a nice fluffy white head that leaves really great lacing . head retention is very good as well . the only flaw was the pour had a bit too much carbonation otherwise this is very asthetically appealing	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : as beautiful as any stout , with deep brown bordering on black ( only the edges give it away ) , bubbles tumbling together as they rise to give the appearance of floating downward ( a glorious optical illusion ) until they gather at the surface to form a thick head the color of cafe au lait , a head that lingered to the point that 1/4 '' remained at the bottom of my glass after the last drop of beer was gone .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : standard yellow , pale ale appearance with minimal head . the carbonation was ok , and i did n't notice lacing , but it may have occured .	000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : deep golden . slight haze ok for this style . fantastic head formation and retention . it stuck around at full volume forever . perfect for an ipa . flavor : citrus , peach , some spicy and floral . i 'm also getting an interesting `` white grape '' flavor . nice malty quality in a fairly dry beer . very balanced but neither the hops or the malt are all that intense . moderate hop bitterness without very much resin . finishes with a nice lasting citrus note . again , reminds me of sn beers .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : a clear golden amber more indicative of a bmc offering than what i think of when i think of a dipa . there is certainly no characteristic head , disappointingly only offering a small thin ring of bubbles around the edge of the glass . overall , very disappointing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : holy head ! i poured very gently into a slightly wet snifter and the head just grew insanely big ( 3+ fingers big ) . light brown , frothy/foamy , and it did n't recede ... when it finally did start dissipating , it became very pillowy . impressive . body is pitch black . leaves good lacing . so far this is quite the experience ! !	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : served in a half-pint slim lager glass , it pours an extremely clear , light straw hue , coming with a rocky and fluffy white beer head sustaining extremely well , supported rather well by the semi-fierce carbonation . looking quite enticing and thirst-quenching , like a lager .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : reddish-mahogany and slightly hazy . 3/4 inch off-white head recedes slowly into a ring of carbonation and surface film . beautiful lacing .	0000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a thin but somehow not totally clear thin light yellow color . a little bit of pure white head that dissipates quickly .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : the ipa is a brilliant copper color , all shiny and new . the clarity is visually appealing . a foamy head , over two fingers , of craggy foam has left extensive lacing all around the glass . a nice looker .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a modest hazed orange-yellow color beneath a truly enormous , champagne peach-blush white satiny pillow of a head that sparkles like freshly fallen snow . solid and beautiful . excellent retention .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : probably the best thing about this beer . if this were a lady it would be a `` full on monet '' a la clueless . decent head retention . reddish amber in color	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : clear straw to yellow body with a white head . flavor : sweet bready malts with a hint of corn ; probably a very lightly malt . mild hop presence where flavor is concerned , mostly bitterness in the back . floral notes .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hardly any head on the pour at all , even with a fairly rapid pour . left minimal lacing on the glass . looks more like a pale ale than a hefe weizen in the glass as far as color and clarity go .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark orange with about a finger of white head that quickly dissipates into a small ring around the top but nothing else . very little lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : red as pomegranate juice , very slight haze , big spongey layer of pink foam , good head retention , some lace	000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : the colour is pale yellow and i did n't get much of a head and i ca n't say much about the lacing because there was n't any .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the fairly typical looking imperial stout ... jet black , brown head , retention is good . there 's not a whole lot more going that makes it stand out from others . s +	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : not much carbonation , arrived with basically no head . cloudy yellow/orange .	000000000000000
1	a : beautiful deep golden , best feature of this beer	00000000000
1	a : deep amber with a fluffy , off-white head . plenty of head , retention and lacing . could n't ask for more .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : first time i 've had this on tap , and i was very impressed by the cascading foam effect from the nitrogen . one finger of nice whipped cream style head , which settles pleasantly atop an almost opaque , dark brown body .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a one finger head of fair cream and thickness , and okay retention . colour is a dark copper . sm : amber hops and other bittering hops . perhaps too many hops for the balance ? a decent aroma .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark cocoa body with a mocha head . looks promising !	0000000000000
0	appearance : this was one nasty pour , murky orange-peach mississippi gumbo of yeast and some other particulate matter .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : moderate pour yields a 3/4 inch head that dissipates steadily and leaves sparse lacing . pours a very hazy yellow , and leaves no lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : looks like an orange soda in many ways , with a short and fizzly head . it has a bit of murkiness that gives it a beer quality .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a nice clear reddish color with a foamy light tan head . a few carbonation bubbles present .	000000000000000000000
0	a : fuzzy yellow with a nice white head .	0000000000
0	appearance : disappointing head , not sure what to expect from a 4.4 % beer from stone ( who knew they made such a sessionable beer ? ) color , however , is perfect for an amber . this looks like a tamer version of arrogant bastard .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : lovely smooth pour that revealed a very dark brown body , huge amounts of natural dissolved carbonation demonstrated that this was properly cask-conditioned beer as opposed to just being a racked off beer from a cask . nice . a smooth creamy light brown head formed slowly as the carbonation settled down . excellent lacing forms as the beer is imbibed . fantastic presentation .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours almost straw-colored with a really tall white compact head that quickly sinks into decent lacings .	0000000000000000000
1	appearance : big chunks of tan foam stick to the glass , lace thins out a bit but the retention is great . the pitch black colour lets no light through .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy golden yellow ; very think head ; light carbonation ; no lacing	000000000000000
1	appearance : black pour with a huge , creamy light cocoa head that settles very slowly and has outstanding retention . this beer leaves many many rings of lace all the way down the glass . an aggressive pour shows off this beer 's deep , penetrating , cascading head . very nice .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear golden body with two inches of creamy white head . good retention and moderate lacing .	0000000000000000000
0	a : this hazy , dark amber brew was highly overcarbonated , requiring several pour-and-waits and leaving a mountain of billowy , tan foam but very little lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours light golden with a few , but large bubbles in the liquid . a small white head dissipates rather fast , leaving only little lacings .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : less then inspiring head , virtually no lacing . clear reddish brown in color .	00000000000000000

0	a : black , tan head , very little retention .	00000000000
0	a : very little head . dirty brown/orange color . no lacing . not impressed in the least .	0000000000000000000
0	a : half finger tan-colour head of very poor retention ( especially considering the low abv ) . dark red colour . sm : overpowering raspberry scent . pleasant .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : i poured it into a tullip glass - dark brown with a thick creamy off-white head that takes a while before it dissipates leaving a nice crater and then nice lacings .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : absolutely gorgeous amber with a slight haze . huge , chunky head . bubbles streaming up from the bottom of my dfh signature glass .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : it poured as black as ink with a moderate one finger head consisting of massive bubbles that receded fast to a slight ring around the collar . there was little lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : black color . this is n't really much of a looker due to the head though . i only managed to form about one finger and it fell quickly . i think it was beige . 4.5	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy golden in color . about a fingers worth of head that dissipates to a nice ring ... . no lacing .	000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : pale , clear yellow , nothing special , huge head	000000000000
1	a : two fingers of creamy head . the beer is dark brown in the shade and a clear , brilliant red in the light . some bubbles within . looks great !	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the darkest pumpkin ale i 've ever seen . i mean really ... . wow ! it looked dark brown coming out of the bottle , but once collected in the glass , it 's maybe a shade or so lighter than pitch black . the head is marshmallowy and clingy .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : luscious golden body with a perfect head . inch skim lasts the entire lifespan of the beer and lacing is simply marvelous all around the glass . i think the shape of the tulip has as much to do with this as the beer itself . it just looks great .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dark , murky brown . poured aggressively , but did n't get a lot of head . hardly any carbonation . dissapointing really in terms of appearance .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured a black , smooth liquid . thick as is to be expected of its brew , but not disgusting like mud . foamy tan head followed .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours black with no head after a hard pour .	000000000000
0	a : straw to yellow , very cloudy with a small whitish head that dissipates rather quickly ( which is uncharacteristic for this style ) .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a fairly dark brown with some copper hues to it . no head and no lacing .	00000000000000000000
0	a : the beer is a light yellow color , with a short white head that fades very quickly and leaves a spotty lace on the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a hazy bronze-colored body with a thin , small white head . virtually no lacing to speak of .	0000000000000000000000
0	appearance : kind of a purpley-red with a pinkish head . not very traditional , but we 're talking about a fruit beer here .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours reddish amber color , 2 finger width frothy white head , good lacing down the glass	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : an effervescent , crystal-clear and amazingly pale straw body capped by a little less than a finger of white head that fizzes out quickly and leaves no lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : very pale yellow color with a tiny head that dissipates almost instantly .	000000000000000
1	a : a vigorous pour straight down the middle produces a sky-high off-white head that perfectly fills the oversized tulip glass . beneath lies an appropriately hazy , reddish orange body that sports lively carbonation . as the rocky 3 '' head slowly recedes it leaves tons of lace . in summation , gorgeous - far better looking that i ever expected .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured cloudy with a deep yellow hue into a sturdy clear plastic cup . the appearance is similar to a hefeweizen , rather than what i come to expect from a well crafted made dipa .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a clear gold yellow with a minimal head and no lacing . smells : a super sweet hop character with a presence on alcohol . tastes : a super sweet imperial . the hop notes are out of the world in this ale with a candied citrus hint that leaves a wonderful finish .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a nice copper color , showing moderate carbonation with tiny bubbles . quite clear . absolutely no head , which is really the only flaw ( although not a minor one ) in the visual presentation .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark brown body with an extremelly small to no tan head that dissipates quickly . holding up to the light , one can get a ruby highlight as well .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : thin head ; light orangish brown ; a bit , but only , of lacing	00000000000000000
1	appearance : a very attractive barleywine , with a hazy amber color and a head that retains nicely , while depositing a lot of lace	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : the best thing ( the good thing ? ) about the guinness nitro-widget-can is the visual of pouring it into a glass , a process that allows me to recreate the draft- pour experience . like pushing the plunger down on a french press batch of coffee , the double or triple pour -- and the dance between bubbles and liquid -- is very much part of the guinness experience . the nitro widget also leads to awesome head retention . the color was a few steps off opaque ( a hint of red-brown ) , but not by much . and then . . .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : deep dark amber colored . with tan head . no lacing	0000000000000
0	a : standard pour creats a 1.5 finger coarse white head with poor retention . beer is a clear , straw-yellow . lacing is patchy and rises like the tides . does n't stick around though .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a crystal clear , light golden ale served with one and a half inches on tight , white head . tons of blanket-like lace and excellent head retention - especially for a trippel ! abundant visible carbonation throughout the tasting .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : beautiful beer . pours with lots , albeit thin , head that hugs the glass on the way down . crystal clear and a crisp copper color . yum .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : gentle pour yields a 1 finger , dense , off-white head that sits , immovable , atop the brew . beer is a semi-clear ruby red . lacing is thick , frothy , and ringed with great stick .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pale gold orange with lots of head .	0000000000
1	appearance : a bit of a gusher with a massive mocha-colored head filling 3/4 of the glass . creamy and bubbling . the light brown pour belies the actual color which is an opaque brown with a slight cherry wood color on the bottom . chunks of lacing cling to the glass . lookin ' nice !	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours quite clear , bright golden yellow with a thickish head held up and together with some surprisingly significant hoppiness . head fades but some lacy hemming around the rims of the glass remains .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a very clear , amber , a decent off-white head with moderate head retention..	0000000000000000
0	appearance : poured from a 12oz bottle into a large wine glass . the color of this one is a very murky , dark amber/brown . not much head to speak of and very little carbonation . there is also quite a bit of sediment in the glass ( which i do n't mind ) . but what i do mind is the large loogie looking thing floating in my glass . i 'm not sure if it is a one-batch anomaly , but there is seriously a tan , quarter-sized globule in my beer that looks like it came from the recesses of the lungs of an 80 year-old smoker .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : light yellow with lots of carbonation .	000000000
0	a : pours an unappealing clear yellow , with a small white head	0000000000000
0	a : just like in the bottle , medium honey color . thin , filmy , uninspiring head . nice ice sheet lacing .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : possibly the lightest colored beer i have ever seen . this is extremely comparable to slightly dirty water or extremely diluted apple cider vinegar . a rather large head appeared and maybe crisp bubbling noises as it quickly disappeared .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a hazy honey-citrus orange with a huge , billowing , dense , white collar head that kept increasing in size after i finished pouring my glass . the top of the head became firm like meringue and stayed as a dollop of cream on top of the beer the whole bottle through . a ton of very sticky lacing was left down the glass as well .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : rusty , copper tone . hardly any head , but it leaves a hint of lace .	0000000000000000000
1	a : pours a hazy copper color with gold highlights when held to a lamp . a two-finger off-white head recedes into a filmy collar on top of the brew , leaving thick lacing down the glass in its wake . a beautiful appearance .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : amber-gold ale with slight haziness . less than single finger head of coarse , tightly packed bubbles retires to a thin sheet of the same . spotty lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a thoroughly hazed tangerine peach , with ( unusually ) one large stream of fast , densely-packed carbonation moving not nearly as fast as i would expect from a beer with this much head . that is , the beer looks it 's gon na be a thick one , but given the haziness of the whole thing , it 's neither a pro nor a con of the appearance . what 's truly fantastic about this beer is what 's truly fantastic about any quality saison - the head . it 's understandably explosive , requiring several of even the gentlest pours to get enough beer in this glass to get a proper review off of . at its height , it 's incredibly sticky , bulbous , rocky , clingy , & lt ; insert other appropriate adjectives here & gt ; . it fades at a snail 's pace , taking a good ten minutes to fade down to a mere ( stylistically ) half-finger . it 's white , dense , cloud-like , and leaves huge patches and swaths of thin , dry lacing . even on the `` sip '' side of the glass it clings admirably despite constant interruption , leaving dozens of flecks and remnants .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured a deep wine purple with a half finger head and light sticky lacing left on the glass	00000000000000000000
1	a : pours a vigorous 1 finger light orange , cream colored fluffy head with excellent retention . brew itself is clear reddish brown and highly carbonated . lacing is stringy but ample and really sticks around .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : black with mahogany highlights . tan head doesnt have much oomph to it ; reduces to a paper thin cap with very little if any lace , but that cap stuck around to the end . flavor : mmmmm right off that bat i really like this one . milk chocolate is really present without being annoying and making me think i grabbed a carton of the stuff . nice balance of the bitter aspect of the black patent and the sweet malt . burnt toast in the middle , and a dry finish with a little bit of green hops . very smooth character . wish it were a little more carbonated than it was , though . seems a little flat at the end .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark brown with a nice finger of tan colored head .	000000000000000
0	a : unfortunately i let this one cool too long and came close to freezing it , but had the copper/amber color and a nice head that lasted with a hazy clarity	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : hazy peach-gold with substantial 2-3 finger , off-white foamy head with craggy lacing all over the glass .	00000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark brown with some edge translucence . a fluffy , light tan head that cascades beautifully into the body as it recedes . tons of sticky lace .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : very good . pours a nice murky brown with very nice brown frothy head and ample lacing .	00000000000000000000
1	appearance : clear golden yellow in color with a thick and fluffy 3 '' head . moderate lacing paints the glass .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a somewhat brownish color that is semi-transparent . had a small head despite vigorous pour .	0000000000000000000
1	a : it poured a bright yellow with a ting of ruby , a bone-white head and nice lacing .	00000000000000000000
1	a : pours a beautiful amber with crimson center that just makes you stop to admire . the head is huge , then settles down to half a finger with perfect lacing . this is the best `` looking '' beer i think i 've ever seen .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : nice dark orange color . very clear . fluffy off white one finger head with awesome retention and lacing .	0000000000000000000000
0	appearance : black as night , with a nice tan head that faded , but remained , but wasn & # 8217 ; t up to the long haul . flavor : outstanding balance , while the hops are clearly present , they don & # 8217 ; t pucker , and the malt , while substantial , doesn & # 8217 ; t over-sweeten . nice roasted malt and chocolate flavors blend into everything a stout should be ; bold , but dry ; rich , but mellow . the hops started to assert themselves deeper into the beer as it warmed .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a mostly clear golden-amber body . 1-1/4 '' lightly creme colored head fades slowly . carbonation bubbles are almost non existent , only one or two tiny ones rise slowly now and then in the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : good thing appearance is n't everything as this beer is just plain ugly , unlike any other beer i 've ever seen . it 's a cloudy , murky , even opaque , yet it 's color is a pale yellow almost beige . small head and some lacing present .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : bright straw body topped with a loose two-finger head that quickly dissipates leaving no lacing and only a bubbly ring of cover .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : reddish color , looks like a bloody mary	0000000000
0	a : a pale bubbly yellow with slight cloudiness . a vigorous pour produces only a small amount of white head that quickly reduces to a small island .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a deel golden/copper color that is cloudy with plenty of floating yeast bits . has a thick foamy head that is a nice milky white . leave considerable amount of lacing	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : very light blond with a slight yeast haze , big head , great retention & lacing .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : cloudy dark brown with big fluffy tan head and decent lacing . only real detractor is huge chunks of yeast from overzealous pour	0000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a light pale yellow color that almost looks clear on the outside of the glass . a few bubbles ride the surface .	00000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very pale gold color , almost yellow . a bit of yeast cloudiness which fits the style . large creamy head that lasts a while .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy orange with not much head and even less lacing . the unfiltered aspect makes it look good . have to note- these av bottles make it hard to buy these sometimes . n : hops and bitter grapefruit as the appearance would indicate . laden with west coast characteristics and sweetness . diverse .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : opens with a swich and erupts rom the bottle so we are forced to pour quickly until the beer can control itsef . the beer is semi transparent and hazy orange with an off white cakey head . the head is quite thick and demonstrative , with plenty of cloudy pillows . very nice .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : this is far and away the lightest double bock i have ever seen . i was convinced upon the pour that the beer was in the wrong bottle . pale gold/straw color with good clarity . thin head with minimal lacing . this scores really low since it is not to style .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a relatively thick black under a small brown head . almost no retention , no lace .	00000000000000000000
0	a : for those wondering - micro-carbonation appears to be a process that makes the bubbles smaller , they actually appear to be undetectable to the human eye since the beer actually looks flat ; take a sip however and there is indeed carbonation there . the head dissipates quickly of course and leaves no lacing . the beer itself is fairly amber for a macro adjunct lager .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : deep , clear amber colored pour . a sticky white head that retains reasonably well . flavor : carmel malt notes up front . an earthy , spicy hop bitterness to balance . some darker fruit notes in the background . balance is nearly even . finish is clean and dry .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : amber/orange with a thin white head . crystal clear . looks good !	000000000000000

0	appearance : pours to a light colored amber with a white , week head that quickly dissapears .	000000000000000000
0	a : golden yellow . light carbonation . white fluffy head which almost disappears as fast as it forms . still looks tasty .	000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours out a cloudy , sufficiently yellow-hued body underneath a tall , dense , near white head with steadfast retention . why , it 's positively elegant-looking .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : 5 |	0000
1	appearance : poured a viscous , sludgy black with little in the way of head , carbonation or lacing ; the 4oz . sampler i had on tap down at stone 's 7th anniversary showed a beautiful , cascading , cocoa-brown head with lots of lacing and good to very good retention ; it is upon the latter experience that i have graded this beer 's appearance ; bottled version would merit a 2.5 .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : very deep mahogany . as dark as some porters . clarity is a quite good . a small and fizzy nougat head comes and goes quickly . leaves no lace .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : deep strawberry/cherry juice color . very clean and opaque . nice billowy off white head in standard belgium style . seriously great looking beer .	000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours clear and copper , nearly flat	000000000
0	a : terrible . pours like piss in a glass . really bad - has white foam - definitely not worthy of calling it head .	00000000000000000000000000

1	a : poured tan with a 2 finger head and a very slight haze . impressive lacing held on to the pint glass it was in .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : ruby red coloring with a white head that has just a tint of red . head is less than one finger and soon gone , but there is active carbonation and a little lacing . beer is dark and a little hazy , not at all crisp looking .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : cloudy blonde with a bone white head and great lacing . just like a wheat beer should look , with the exception of what looks to be relatively low carbonation for the style .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a tiny white ring atop a clear orange-red brew . no real head and no retention . no lacing either . rather flat-looking overall if it were n't for the ample bubbles seen rising from the depth .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a pretty cloudy burnt orange color with a 1 '' head of off-white bubbles that was thick and creamy and looked like it was n't going anywhere anytime soon . on the side of my glass , i can see that there are numerous bubbles rising to maintain the head , and it does . a couple minutes after the pour there was no significant difference in the height of the head . there is a ton of thick lace left on the glass after drinking the beer . if it was a bit more clear , this would be a well presented beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a rich golden-yellow color with a small , foamy white head that settles to just a few bubbles of lace on the top . no lacing and poor head retention .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a cloudy amber body with orange tones against the light . has a fairly generous 2 inches of head with pretty good retention , taking between 5-10 minutes to collapse into a lighter cap on top of the brew before i can start drinking . thick scoops of lace down the sides from the head , and light register marks as i sip .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured with a foamy off white head that dissipated leaving no lacing . the beer is clear with an orange golden color .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear , brown body with hints of amber . a massive 1-1/4 '' head nearly overflowed the glass , and seemed to take forever to fade to a thick film .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a hazy dark red-brown . not much head . some scant leggy lacing . really a very boring looking beer .	000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : a light gold in color , it was also crisp and transparent . the word i wrote in my notes on the phone was `` gorgeous '' . a nice , thin , but full layer of head provided a pretty white cap on top . lacing was minimal .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : cloudy . small tan head that leaves quick .	00000000000

0	a : golden , clear yellow . fast fade head .	00000000000
0	appearance : crystal clear sunset orange . a little lacing from a thin , pure-white head .	00000000000000000
1	a : clear , dark gold with a fluffy , clean white head and great retention to go with very good lace . i 'll make a note that this must have the straightest/cleanest break from beer to head that i 've ever seen . 4.5/5	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this ris looks amazing . a perfect layer of creamy light brown head sit on top of the opaque body .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : the appearance is red/brown solid with a big fluffy head . the slow head retention is nice and slow . plenty of time to enjoy the picture . if you drink it down a little you can see the mass amounts of lace on your glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a slightly hazy straw color with a thin fizzy head that dissipates into pretty much no head . no lacing , moderately active carbonation .	0000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours hazy amber with an enormous tan head that slowly sinks into quite nice lacings .	000000000000000000
0	a : turbid , golden amber . no head to speak of from my bottle .	0000000000000000
1	a : fucking gorgeous . a finger and a half of head -- creamy and tight . a beautiful red ; dark and darkly clear . nice scattered lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a lightly carbonated appearance for a saison with minimal lacing . a ruddy orange color throughout .	0000000000000000000

0	a : 1 finger head , amber color .	000000000
1	a : 4 ,	0000

0	a : bright yellow . heavy carbonation pours into a half finger , bubbly , white head . dissipates quickly into a smattering of bubbles . substantial carbonation continues to rise . no lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured a slightly opaque medium golden-amber with a sticky , foamy 1.5 finger head . the opaqueness dissapated a bit after a few minutes , but did n't dissapear altogether , and the head began to recede after a minute or two leaving a light lacing around the top . as far as the pour was concerned , things were looking pretty good .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : it 's darker than coffee . the nitrogen helps it to produce an awesome brew to look perfect . i loved it to pour and to watch its great neck .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours blonde , with a smallish white head , no lacing , fair retention .	00000000000000000

0	appearance : not the most vigorous pour , but this beer produced hardly any head . even worse the retention had to be sub 50 seconds producing 0 lacing . golden color , cloudy with what i hope is yeast . bubbly , but not appearing to be too carbonated . not even the slightest bit of a lacing when agitated .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : baby diarrhea or bilge water ( take your pick ) - either is unappealing to drink ; but big beautiful beige head compensates a little	000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : colour of the beer is a murky brown with amber edges . carbonation creates a hissing noise as the beer is poured into the cup . flat head ... a bit of a dissapointment , but i do remember it being much better when i ordered it at 't brugs beertje in belgium .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : ruddy copper with a finger of light yellow foam . this falls to a broken sheet of the same . spotty lace .	0000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : pale gold-straw color , clear . a little carbonation . thin head .	000000000000000
1	appearance : straw gold and clear with about 2 fingers of head . a slow dissipation leaves a thick lacing .	000000000000000000000
0	a : coppery , clear , no head at all , even after a fairly aggressive down-the-middle pour . there is also no lacing to speak of . thus far , i am not impressed .	000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : this beer pours a bright , just off white head that fills up the entire glass before revealing a golden white body of beer with lots of active carbonation beneath it that slowly transitions to a stiller , golden color while the head remains bright white . it leaves a nice lace and is very clear . if the head would stay around a little more , i 'd be happier 4.5	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pale , quite a clear beer ... the chili added to the bottle causes a rather unusual , sharp bubbling . the head forms incredibly fizzly and immediately recedes to nothing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this beer poured a clear amber that had just enough red highlights to be called copper colored . the off-white head rose up to two fingers easily . it lingered quite awhile , slowly dissipating and becoming dense and fluffly . as it sank back into the beer , it clung heavily to the side of the glass . there was some light lacing left behind as i drank .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : a dark brown , which shines ruby red when held up to the light . there 's a 1 finger foamy head that sticks around for a bit , with decent lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear light copper color . good 2 fingers worth of head that settles quickly to a small ring with no real lacing to speak of .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : very golden color with mild carbonation . a little less carbonation than i 'd expect from the `` champagne of beers '' .	0000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : looks like flat cola . very thin and somewhat transparent . no head , even when swirled . obviously no lacing either . looks downright terrible . worst looking oatmeal stout i 've ever come across .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : looks like corona . and pee ( same sh*t , right ? ) . golden yellow/orange , clear liquid . worthless yellowish head that foams up a lot when pouring and disappears quickly , like soda . does n't start out too well ...	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : 0 carbonation , more of a dark ruby than actually opaque , pours thick , but with no head whatsoever	0000000000000000000000

0	a : no real head at all . it 's possible it disappeared from the pour to my table . colour is a dark caramel-ruby . sm : caramel , toasted malt , and maybe light citrus ester hops . a mild strength aroma .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : thin head , little carbonation , no lacing	0000000000
0	appearance : served in a brookyln shaker pint , extremely dull pale yellow - looks almost like lemonade	000000000000000000
0	a : light yellow with a slight haze , white head , very little retention , no lacing ( where 's the protein ? ) .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : wow . the only beer i can think of that pours like this is gonzo porter by flying dog ... it 's very thick and looks just like motor oil . even more shocking is the coffee-colored three-finger head that followed , although maybe it 's just because it 's an unbelievably fresh bottle that had quite a bit of energy packed behind a too-easy-to-get-out cork . quite the specimen .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : robust pile of thick and espresso like head , the color reminds me of slightly tarnished copper , obvious lacing - 4.50 ,	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : yeugh . lots and lots of little floaties . i know they are n't bad for me , but they still make for an ugly beer . tall , pillowy white seafoam head crowns the top of this hazy honey-colored brew . lots of lacing around the rim of the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a very effervescent beige head on a seemingly opaque dark brown body . retention is outstanding , with a thick cap on the beer and tons of sticky lace down the sides of the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pale almost orange transparent , very thin head .	00000000000
0	appearance : looks very pale , as if it was watered down . has the carbonation of most club sodas .	000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a nice looking pint . a moderate pour gives a 1.5 '' of ivory head that barely crests the rim of the glass . brew has a hazy honey appearance . head settles to almost nothing , just a meniscus clinging to the glass . lace is n't worth mentioning .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : i knew this would be a gusher and it still took 3 glasses to hold this monster back . dogfish super glass comically oversized dogfish tulip and an ithaca pint glass . 12 ? fingers of slightly tan head . the beer itself is a nice looking deep burnt rusty brown color . tons of visible carbonation .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a brilliant clear gold , foamy white head , lots of lacing , great retention	000000000000000000
1	a : pours medium yellow with a good sized head that settled quickly . very little lacing .	000000000000000000
1	a : very drak brown with clumpy tan 2 finger head and plenty of lace .	0000000000000000
1	appearance : a dark brown that reminds me of fender 's tobacco-burst design when it catches the light , albeit with more ruby hues . low/medium viscosity , with medium visibility . poured without a head , and very little lacing , though i suspect this had to do with the frosty glass provided by the establishment .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pale yellow with a small , somewhat retaining head .	000000000000
1	a : pours a nice very dark black color reminiscent of a stout but it does show dark mahogany colors when held to the light , the head is about a half inch high but it comes down fairly quickly leaving a good amound of lacing	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : looks like a dark liquor poured into a pale beer . terrible and unattractive .	00000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear light golden with an enormously billowing bright white head that slowly faded into a rocky film that left chunks of sticky lacing down the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : transparent with a great deal of carbonation . color is similar to that of ginger ale . head dissipates rather quickly .	000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pale yellow , minimal white head . looks like a light commercial beer almost .	00000000000000000
0	appearance : draught served up with less than one finger of foam which dissapated within two minutes . slight lacing remains on brim of straight-side libby pint glass .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : murky amber with a finger of tan head .	00000000000
0	a : dirty brown with tiny white head . has a bunch of impurities that float around .	000000000000000000
0	a : unfortunately , quite unimpressed . head was more fizzly like a soda may be and withered away to nothing quite quickly . brew itself is almost a cola colour , with more of a dark red & brown hue to it . that said , it 's the only attribute i was n't fond of .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a bold sienna with an enormous foamy head . leaves thick rings of lace on the glass .	00000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a dark , dark brown , almost black - just a hint of light shines through at the bottom of the glass . three fingers of off-white head that dissipates slowly and leaves ton of lacing . as this type of beer should look .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : gorgeous bright red . it 's astoundingly lovely - i can easily say that i 've seen a beer quite like it . a generous pour yields a 1.5 finger flaming pink head that looks like strawberry ice cream . the retention and lacing are top notch .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : thin but creamy head . the colour is the darkest brown and opaque on the desk , but when held up to the light , it is translucent and brilliantly ruby-coloured . gorgeous !	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : : very clear deep copper in the glass . thick one finger head reduces to a thin white film with some lacing .	0000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : disappointing head , and unusually clear golden straw color .	000000000000
1	a : pale yellow color , fully transluscent , insane amount of head , pure white and frothy with tons of lacing .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : from a 750ml bottle with the usual lovely dwarf character reaping hops . very colorful design with a graphic depiction of the hops varieties used ( amarillo has a sombrero and so on ... ) . served into a la chouffe tulip . poured straw yellow with big crazy bubbles dancing all up to the massive cloudy head that sticks like cotton candy during the whole drinking session . amazing . *edit : actually more in the hues of golden yellow . will never review appearance with a computer screen as only light source ever again !	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : somewhere between straw and golden , slightly hazy . white head was n't around long , leaving just a tiny thin strip of lacing behind .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a very rich , deep amber.. clear , with nice white head.. a very pretty beer .	0000000000000000000
0	a : it pours a rusty nail brown with no evidence of carbonation . the beer is pretty murky at this point in its life , but i can still pick out some deep amber hues in the light .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a slightly hazy yellow-gold with half a finger of white head that quickly recedes into almost nothing with no lacing .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : excellent clear amber under a pretty large head after a vigorous pour . good head retention and excellent lace .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy wheat-yellow , very little head and a thin ring . milky , but a little carbonation shows in the waning sunlight . fuller in the center , less opaque at the edges . small flecks of lace .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : this beer poured a yellow hue with a bright white head that only stood up roughly one inch high and settled at a quarter inch . lots of beading inside and no much lace to speak of .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear straw with white head , decent foam stand .	000000000000

0	a : poured a deep coppr/reddish color with a small white head that disappeared quickly .	0000000000000000
0	appearance : pours dark brown and yields a small , dark tan or mocha colored head that appears out of nowhere . head fades relatively quickly to a wisp and ring . black body , though relatively transparent , with medium carbonation evident . a ring remains until the end and leaves touches of lacing down the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear , slightly hazy ( we 'll see whether or not that clears up when the beer warms , it remains hazy ) copper and golden amber , topped with a loosely packed , sandy white , half an inch head that fades into some lattice work lacing and a sort of spotty cap of a head . no lacing to speak of apart from a few specks here and there .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : beautiful mezmorizing cascading effect . a 1+ finger thick looking tan head forms with great retention . beer is opaque and pitch black with no carbonation evident . a thick head remains and leaves lots of thick lacing down the glass . looks great , though i prefer a white head on my nitro stouts .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours pitch black color , no head whatsoever .	00000000000
1	appearance : black with a hint of copper . dark tan head that last a good while . flavor : sweetness on the tongue . chocolate and toffee flavors . moves to a dry finish and a caramel after taste .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : lightly hazy , raisin juice colored ale . off white carbonation barely clings to life at the around the ring of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : a great looking beer . a golden blond hue that pours with a thick white head . visibly effervescence . sticky lacing .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : it pours a clear , dark copper hue , coming with a stunning , nice and frothy off-white beer head ( poured w/o a sparkler ) that lasts throughout the drink , and leaves extremely tight lacing curtains as it goes .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours out a viscous tar black body seriously , if molasses was more molten , it would look like this . half finger head that looks like hot chocolate textured by a frothing wand rises quickly then fades .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear , brassy golden color with one finger of white foam head . heavy step-wise lacing remains on the glass and a few solitary bubbles rise in the column .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a touch lighter than most octobers , coppery amber for sure , but leaning towards a dried apricot hue . little head to speak of , and the least amount of lacing or collar .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : deep copper/amber color . opaque . weak head and head retention . quite unpleasant looking for a tripel .	000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a beautiful black that has a wonderful bubbly light brown display that turn into the creamy head of tiny tiny bubbles . one nice looking beer .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : the white head exploded up to a whole four fingers as i poured this beer into my pilsner glass . as it settled down , it became a little fluffy and chunky . it took a long time to finally dissipate and left some nice chunks of foam on the side of the glass in its wake . also , a number of little floaties remained until i had finished the drink . those were all qualities that i found strange considering that this is a lager . the golden yellow liquid that sat below the foam had just a hint of haze to it and a relatively light bead .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : half a finger of slight cream , decent thickness , and bad retention . semitransparent dark copper colour . sm : cream , pleasant hops , and caramelized malt . a moderate strength aroma .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : incredibly pale yellow . as with many other light lagers , the appearance is incredibly reminiscent of water . there is a fluffy white head , initially , which quickly disappears .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a slightly hazy yellow , with not that much of head , fizzy bubbles at best , not cloudy enough for a wit as well .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : appropriately opaque pale orange body topped by a finger of dense , creamy ecru head . great retention , solid lace . perfect looking witbier , and the proper glassware really seals the deal .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : my wife bought me a case of this one at our favorite local distributor , in-n-out . the guys there are very knowledgeable and recommended this one to her and am i glad . this beer poured a beautiful thick frothy two finger head . as i drank the beer it got more impressive with amazing sticky lace . the side of the glass became covered from top to bottom . the color was a very clear orangish amber .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : ruby brown with good clarity , a thin head of creamy coffee left no lace . flavor : over ripe apples , belgian banana , spiced apple and a hint of farm cider . fruity and rich in flavor	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : there are n't many things in the world of beer as delightful as the cascading nitro guinness . the `` waterfall '' . a clean and filtered brew much the color of dark cola . this beer does n't generate little streams of bubbles like a stand co2 beer will . the head is is a wonderfull khaki , smooth and creamy .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours oily black with a thick , chunky tan head that has ruby edges .	00000000000000000
1	appearance : a dark body with a mocha head that fills half of the tulip . looks delicious to be honest .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a deep shoe leather brown , opaque . about a finger worth of light khaki head forms and holds nicely . decent lacing .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : way too light to be an ipa . looks like a lager .	000000000000000
0	a : pours with no head ? dark , though not opaque . expecting way more for a 7.5 % stout	000000000000000000000
1	a : nice copper color to the body . nice-sized tan head , but it takes off rather quickly and does n't leave much behind .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours an opaque black with a tight tan head , which leaves nice lacing behind .	000000000000000000
1	a : amber color with small half-finger 's head that did n't last too long . not too impressive , so given its reputation , i blame myself for a bad pour .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : an ugly beer , low alcohol or not . jaundiced pale yellow with a weak , white head and sparse carbonation .	000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : the pour is a murky apple cider color with faded straw yellow edges . a small frothy off-white collar fades to nothing and leaves no lace .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a deep golden/light amber , quite clear but rich , with a huge , fluffy head that sticks to the sides of the glass . i pour about half the bottle , leave the room for a few minutes and the head is still at the top of the glass . this is a very handsome beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured a dense black . holding the beer up to the light , the darkness remained exactly the same ; impenetrable . only about a one inch head , but great retention .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a black pour makes a one finger , medium-thin , fizzy , noisy , light brown head that quickly vanishes . poor retention and overly noisy . black body and some carbonation decorates the wisp at the top . head quickly fades to a ring and splotchy wisp . by the end , however , it looks totally flat and leaves no lacing down the glass . decent body , but the head is lousy .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : very nice deep black with a prominent mocha colored head . sticky lacing left behind with good head retention . it settles to a nice film and perks back up with a quick swirl of the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : fairly clear golden color with a minimum ring of white head .	00000000000000

1	a : golden yellowish orange pour , somewhat cloudy . nice 2 fingers head with good retention and some decent lacing .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : as to be expected , sam adams has incredibly tight quality control , and as such i expect them to pay attention to something other brewers may put on the backburner in order to concentrate on aroma or flavor : the appearance . i was n't disappointed , in that regard . poured with a really large , two finger coffee color/caramel color head , which settled only after about 3 to 5 minutes ( quite a while , really ) to a half-finger . still pretty robust looking head , though , at a half-finger . body is complete night black , totally opaque , and what you 'd hope for in an ris . lacing is exceptional - lasts until you take a sip or swirl again , patterns all over the place , mountainous , arms , and spots . a+ job on the appearance .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a clear , deep amber body with a foamy , creamyish , near-white head .	000000000000000000
0	a : pours a very foamy white head like a coors . i hate coors-like foam . body is a pale amber color . otherwise , very clingy with much lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a firm voluminous head over a somewhat murky light yellow body . thick , bulbous lacing forms a ring with hefty legs .	00000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a nice coffee-colored clear body with a towering tan head that leaves lots of lacing as the liquid is consumed ; a great looker	000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a bright and clear golden yellow with a moderate amount of rising bubbles . about a finger of white head that quickly fades into a small thin patch . lacing is very light .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : mahogany brown in color . no head at all when poured and no lacing . thick looking and even slightly cloudy . sort of bland looking .	00000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours a slightly hazy pale golden color with a beaten egg white head that leaves all kind of lacing	000000000000000000000
1	a : the beer poured a creaamy and nearly black hue . even back lit i could find not color other than black . an aggressive pour resulted in a massive sticky milk chocolate head of more than four fingers . the head receded leaving a beautiful tan lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : high-yellow , almost white when poured . huge white head , about half of which sticks around for a bit .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : honey-gold with scant , wispy off-white head with a minimum of lace around the glass .	000000000000000000
0	a : dark brown on the edges otherwise almost black . minimal tan head quickly dissipates to a spotty ring of lace .	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : golden yellow in color . crystal clear . poured with two fingers of smooth foam . plenty of lively carbonation . head had okay retention , lasting a couple of minutes . left plenty of lacing in clumps down the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : copper with a finger of off-white foam which falls quickly to a sheet of the same . near cobweb lace . excellent clarity .	00000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : beer is dark brown , the color of cola . head is disappointing , in that a vigorous pour yielded a head less that a finger thick . no visible carbonation or lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : mahogany , or close to midnight black color , with an evil ruby tint in just the very edge of the glass . a smooth , creamy brown head cascades a little bit before forming and retains nicely . thick sticky lace clings all over the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dirty reddish brown . on the first pour there was a significant oxidized pinkish head , but it reduced quickly and was never really seen again on the successive pours . reduced to nothingness - not even a surface coating . no lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : hazel brown . many many co2 trails release from all over glass . pours half an inch of bubbly white head . holy effervescent . retains half an inch of head . leaves lace around glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : copper and rust colored liquid with a minimal white head and slow flowing carbonation .	00000000000000000
0	a : pours a somewhat brown color . it is mostly a really dark yellow , or almost amber . it wants to be brown , but you know what ? it 's not . it just is n't . got like a 1/4 inch of head that disappeared almost instantly . so sad . lots of active carbonation . i am noticing a trend here . these beers are all super carbonated are n't they ?	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : golden hazed beauty in a robust 20oz tulip shaped glass with a magnificant foaming white head leaves great batches of belgian style lacing , wow .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pitch black throughout with a tight , inviting , 1.5 finger , light brown head on top . great retention and lacing - leaves thick notches at each resting point .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : admitaly the beer was a bit warm when i poured it , but a regular pour resulted in a head eruption . the glass was about 30 % beer and 70 % head . i had to wait almost 10 minutes to finish pouring it . the body is deep black with ruby notes on the edge with a mocha colored head .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : semi-clear orange-amber hue , excellent head retention ... nice froth from the initial pour .	00000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear , apple cider gold with the tinyest suggestion of head on top . really . it barely reached 1/8 of a finger thick before it completely disappeared . not one speck of lace was left behind .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : this is like water with yellow food coloring . the head is nonexistant , except for the carbonation at first .	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : copper in color , bright and perfectly clear . head retention is great for an 11 % beer , leaving plenty of lace sticking to the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : clear reddish golden color . head , well , i think there was a head . i blinked and it had disappeared .	0000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours blond with a minor white head , no lace , pallid .	000000000000000
0	appearance : i look at the beer and think i got the wrong one , the server assures me this is the right beer . the lazlo 's limited red ale is , well , not red . it was a dull copper/amber color , even a little orangish maybe , but nothing close to red . the beer was also a little hazy . moderately carbonated , i could see bubbles rising quickly throuigh the liquid . the beer was also very cold and served with no head , a ring around the glass and left no lacing . i notice a small note card on the table describing the beer from the description given , i guess this is really the red ale . personal note : here in the land of the huskers , we love our red meat , big red gum , and if a beer proclaims to be a red ale , then bygawd it had better be red .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : black with brown hues around the edges . fat three head khaki . excellent retention and solid lacing . 5	0000000000000000000000

1	a : pours solid black with good viscosity . 1 finger of head forms with a bit of a cascading effect . the head is deep mocha and has good retention . very good lacing throughout .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pale straw . pretty heavy carbonation pours into a 2 finger bubbly white head . settles quickly leaving only a smattering of bubbly carbonation on the surface of the brew . substantial carbonation continues to rise . no lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : yellow with a faint pinkish tinge to it . decent layer of suds .	0000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a thick black color with a fluffy 3+ '' head . thick lacing coats the glass . the head lasts through the drink .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear , light golden yellow like pee with a natrual white soda-style head and little rising bubbles throughout .	000000000000000000000
0	appearance : my glass was filled with an amber ale with golden edges , a nice off-white 1/4 '' head that quickly receeds to form a wispy sheet over the surface . there was a little lacing throughout the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this pours [ insert poetic reference to darkness , absence of light , day becoming night , the breaking loneliness of a 14-year-old goth boy ] black . some edge translucence , but you really have to search for it . nicely dark . what impresses me is that the head , a tan color , has great retention and substantial lace . must be a lot of hop resins in this beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : more of a brownish goldish color reminds me of apple cider , has a mild haze , looks flat , little to no head , little lace , does n't look attractive	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : i worked the cork out the bottle wondering what i 'd get . nada . no pop . poured out totally flat . color is a dark , murky brown .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : deep red to light brown , minimal to zero head , light lacing . sure , it 's difficult to maintain head on a 8.2 % beer , but this one had almost none from the get-go .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours into my delirium tulip a deep brown with a small light tan head . it drops instantaneously to a medium collar with some hazy bubbles floating across the surface .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : aggressively dropped him right down the center of the glass and was left with nothing more than a few bubbles for head . dark brown body , with light only cracking through along the edges of the glass . this looks sludgy in the glass , closer to what i 'd expect from a quad or a stout than a flanders bruin .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : during the pour , i noticed this had to be the lightest in color imperial stout i 've ever seen . the beer is dark brown with a nice creamy looking pale beige head with ok retention and ok lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : with 2-3 oz reserved , poured a clear , bright , ruby color ( +0.5 ) with a light amount of white head . head rapidly dissipated into a ring of white lacing with a small island of foam in the middle of my glass . pouring the remainder of the beer resulted in a little cloudiness and some fruit pectin at the bottom of my goblet ( +0.5 ) . this real-deal fruit beer ! like a hand-crafted fruit beer . my experience with fruit beers is that a persistent head is atypical and can be a flaw .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : transparent yellow , reminiscent of piss .	000000000
1	a : pours a very deep brown with a 2.5 finger , slightly tan head , leaves copious lacing everywhere , and it 's retention is second to none . settles into a small cap . held to light shows a very dim amber hue around the extreme edges , but light does n't really get through . very beautiful beer , one of the best looking beers i 've ever seen , of any style .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : crimson hue that painted my palm in a blood red glow as i held my glass . light bubbles on top after pouring , but no lacing to speak of . the way this brew plays with the light is captivating .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : golden honey color with a thick 1 inch white head that fades at a decent rate . very good .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : dark yellow with lots of bubbles . thick head full of large gnarly bubbles . very little lacing .	000000000000000000000
1	a : after giving the bottle a good roll on the table to release the yeast which had settled on the bottom of the bottle , this beer poured a beautiful , yeast-filled hazy straw color into my pint glass . just as i would hope and expect . a beautiful , well sustained 2 inch head slowly dissipates , leaving a nice lace on the glass as this beauty goes down .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : lives up to its dark moniker , this is probably one of the darker scottish/scotch ales i have seen to date , being pretty opaque with a moderately lingering medium tan head .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : typical yeti in that it pours dark as night , but there is a much more persistent creamy tan head maintained by a bunch of bubbles cascading to the top . this is going on pretty much the whole beer . there is also a pretty decent amount of lacing left on the glass after drinking .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : hard pour gives a huge slowly-building brown head that tops out at ~2 '' and threatens to overflow the glass . settles very slowly to large bubbles and craters , leaving a thick solid curtain of lace on the glass . thick black brew lets zero light through , even when held to a bright light . perfect appearance .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a deep dark brown , almost black color . provides a one finger tan foam head with moderate retention and ample lacing .	00000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : dark brown with only a little transparency . not much of a head .	0000000000000000
1	a : the beer pours a nice brown color , maybe dark brown with a small head , and very nice lacing ...	00000000000000000000000
0	a : fizzy like cola - fine bubbles , thin `` head '' dissipates completely in 10 seconds . the color is the same as what i see when i head to the little boys room after drinking too many tsingtaos .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : cloudy / sandy brown color , with a fair amount of sediment that poured out into the bottom of the glass . only a modest amount of head . uninspiring .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a light orange with a small white head , fair retention , no real lace .	0000000000000000000
1	a : i was very impressed with the appearance of this beer . i prefer an ipa with a more structured malt base , and this certainly did not disappoint . the beer poured a very nice rich golden color with a 2+ finger head that held on for several minutes . there was heavy lacing the whole way down the glass when i finished .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : sort of a deep purple . no head , a few bubbles , barely anything going on .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : cloudy beige orange , excellent head retention it seems to stick around forever .	0000000000000000
1	appearance : golden hue with a bright clarity , obviously they were going for that deep golden honey colour . above par head retention , nice and bubbly with some stickiness .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a big two-finger tan head . head is medium thick , bumpy and bubbly . it settles with lots of pot holes and is very uneven . colour is black with ruby tints on the bottom of the glass , and it 's relatively opaque . head slowly dissipates leaving a healthy film behind , and some nice lacing falls down the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a deep mahogany color , almost purple looking . thin puny little head with almost no retention . some water watery looking in terms of viscosity .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this beer poured a little thin for a stout , but it was a nice , dark brown color . light only penetrated it when the glass was held up to the light . the beige head rose up huge and settled very , very slowly . it was all rough and rocky and left thick , sticky chunks of foam behind on the side of the glass . the lacing was very heavy , sheeting the glass in solid bubbles in most places .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear golden body with a non-existent white head that barely leaves a ring around the glass - this is either flat or it 's the most disappointing head i 've ever seen on a beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : an aggressive pour yielded a full , five-fingered thick foamy , frothy head ... clear golden hue ...	00000000000000000000
1	a : poured a deep copper with slight red tint , 1/4 inch tan head	000000000000000
1	a : huge amounts of head fill the top halves of the glasses . tight and bubbly . very white with good retention . the beer is full of tiny champagne bubbles . scattered , wispy head clings to the sides . the beer is light coppery , just barely clear .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a soda like purple mixed with brown , the head is a half inch of pure whiteness which is an odd contrast with the purple liquid , no lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : beautiful ruby , red , tannish ( ? ) head	000000000000
0	a : poured a very cloudy orange color , head faded very quickly , lots of sediment floating around .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : golden with very small head and almost no retention	00000000000
0	a : a fairly hard pour still only produces a finger of short-lived white foam atop the hazy pale orange body . what head there is disappears quickly and leaves no lace . pretty disappointing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : really clear , pale yellow , weak head , little retention , no lacing .	00000000000000000
0	appearance : pours dark , almost black but relatively transparent , and produces a small , medium-looking tan head with half decent retention . head fades relatively quickly to a faint wisp and bubbly ring around the sides . black body and zero carbonation evident . a slight ring and touches of wisp remain , leaving a few dots of lacing down the glass . decent looking but nothing special .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours headless pale straw ; sad	00000000
1	a : the appearance of this brew is very alluring as it shines a gorgeous orange .	00000000000000000
1	a : really nice clarity on this one . almost beautiful . a half finger of white head with a nice amount of lacing .	0000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a bright , yet hazy , yellow with big , soapy head . good amount of lacing and a surprisingly large amount of yeast .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : slightly aggressive pour results in thin off-white head which dissipates in a minute or two . color of beer is a murky amber with very slight signs of carbonation . sparse lacing occures with good retention .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a dark brown , near black body that 's near still . it fails to form a head , but does cast a few large beige bubbles .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : nice copper color . could n't wait to drink it . low head retention but expected from a cask .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a slightly golden yellow color with about a fingers worth of head that bubbles and fizzes away very quickly	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : served in an unbranded tulip - glowing pinkish red body with a big foamy pinkish beige wave that retains itself fully	00000000000000000000000
0	a : the beer did not have a very good head , it poured a weak white color and never really stuck to the glass . the body has a nice pale autumn orange color .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : an elegant golden beer with visible suspended yeast particles and a tightly wound white creamy cap arrives in a branded stange . very nice appearance .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a motor oil black with a 2-3 finger creamy chocolate brown head . excellent lacing . looks pretty much perfect for a stout .	000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : black pour with a dense , foamy , lasting , 1 finger tan head .	00000000000000000
1	a : excellent tan head and thick lacing , very dark brown/orange color ...	00000000000000
0	a : deep murky dark chocolate brown . dark beige rapidly depleting head is simply a now distant memory .	00000000000000000000
0	a : pours a cloudy deep amber body . a 1 '' off-white head slowly fades to a thick film . a few dots of lacing are left behind on the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a beautiful dark reddish amber with a finger of fluffy off white head . there is a decent amount of retention and some very nice lacing . pretty beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a medium brown in color , slightly tan head starts to emerge and slowly dissapates into just a thin wisp of lace . head retention is decent , not enough to blow my socks off .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear red-brown with two-finger , off-white , creamy head that lasted a more than a few minutes . great lacing .	00000000000000000000000
0	appearance : light yellow , to basically clear , even more clear than others	00000000000000
0	a : previous a very murky orange with three fingers of very effervescent , khaki head that quickly recedes into a few fizzy bubbles with no lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this beer is a beautiful golden hazy color that represents the style well . the last 1 inch of beer i swished in the bottle and pitched it into the beer to get the yeast well distributed . i got a 2 finger head , and that receded slowly to a 1/2 finger head that stayed there throughout drinking the entire bottle . the lacing on this beer is the absolute best i have ever seen . even beats sierra nevada pale ale .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy amber yellow . no visible carbonation , and no head .	00000000000000
0	a : dark and rather translucent for the style , almost looks like a dunkel . a three finger head quickly dissipates to a half finger head . the head does not appear to be creamy like other examples of the style . the head soon dissipates to a cap , this is a big no-no for this style .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : slightly hazy medium brown . coarse , off-white head that 's barely there at all .	000000000000000000
1	a : wow , i 'm impressed that the apparatus in the can really works . loud fizz when can opened . amber hue with finger or so of head that did not dissipate at all while drinking .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : yellowish straw color , cloudy with a very thin white head that dissipates quickly . kind of looks like a bud regular actually , haha ...	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : bottle describes this as blacker than night . eh , i do not agree . it 's very dark with ruby highlights around the edges . tiny mocha colored head that fades quickly and leaves little lacing on the glass . nothing special .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear burnt amber with an insanely fluffy light tan head that took forever to fade into a dense oily film that looked like almost-melted vanilla ice-cream . i could not ask for better rocking lacing either .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : quite lovely , and promising . autumnal oranges and browns , a frothy and bulbous off-white head , setting the tone .	000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured from a 12oz bottle into a large wine glass . pours a golden/brown , with a frothy , tan , two-finger head . when the light hits it right , the beer has a slight ruby tinge to it . amazing head retention and some of the most spectacular lacing i 've seen .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : beautiful pure copper color with a remarkably long lasting head .	0000000000000
0	a : after a loud pop upon uncorking , this beer pours with a large 2 1/2 finger cappuccino colored head , creamy/frothy texture and semi-long lasting . lingering film remains . the body is dark brown with amber edges along the glass when held to light . spare lacing . sediment is included on the last pour .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : looks more like a blonde than a pale ale . very clear , slightly yellow , nice white head and lace .	000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : motor oil . it was poured vigorously into a 13 oz . unibroue tulip , and still there was no froth or head to speak of . obviously my expectations were tempered by the age , but it was as flat as flat can be .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pitch black with a big , fluffy , dark brown head with great retention . lacing is awesome .	000000000000000000000
0	a : very thin ( 1/4 finger ) head formed then dissipated within 15 seconds . color is slightly amber to dark golden . bubbles still forming 3 minutes after it was poured are extremely large , like those in a soda . in fact , by appearance this beer looks exactly like a light cream soda or dark ginger ale -- no head , large bubbles , and lots of spritzy fizziness on the surface of the beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : amber-copper with tiny particulates floating throughout the beer , not sure what that was about , possibly a bad bottle ? off-white , small , tight head that diminished quickly and left a little spotty lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pale yellow with a quick forming and quick disappearing head that leaves nothing in its trail not even a thin lace , looks like apple juice or something else .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours clear , about a shade `` golder '' than urine , with a fizzy white head that does n't really last . has slightly less carbonation than a soda , and it leaves a behind some thin white lacing on the glass . not terribly impressive , but standard for the style .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : deep brown , clear when backlit . thin tan head that retreated quickly . given the abv , not unexpected . flavor : both the dark malt and the crisp hops come through in a nice 1-2 combo punch . full rich malt taste followed by a very clean , dry , slightly bitter finish that is quite refreshing . hops seem a bit strong for the style , but given the blending of aged and fresh beer , seems appropriate .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : like diluted urine , over carbonated , little to no head retention	00000000000000
1	appearance : the body of the beer is dead black . i love watching a beer reverse cascade and this one did a pleasing job of that . the head is thick a and pillowy . the coloration of the head is like nuget in a 3 musketeers bar . great head retention . we eat with our eyes first or so i am told . watching this beer pour makes me thirsty !	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a very dark black color not able to see through at all even when held to the light . as poured , there is a tan on black affect as the head rises to to the top of the beer . there is an off white very creamy head that does not dissapear lacing all the way down the glass	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a .5 finger thick , creamy white head with poor retention . beer is a semi-clear reddish-purple . lacing is spotty and stringy with poor cling . pretty standard for the style .	000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : pour not as thick as expected . produces a 1+ finger , thinner-looking mocha colored head with decent retention . very noisy head too . black body with higher levels of carbonation for the style . head slowly fades to a wisp with lots of carbonation decorating the top of the brew . a slight wisp and a ring remain , leaving some dots of lacing down the glass . too much carbonation for the style , and the head is simply too weak .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this is the highlight of the beer . it looks really good . nearly pitch black , and a creamy off white head that sticks to the glass perfectly ...	00000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : a rather aggressive pour is rewarded with 2+ inches of thick tan head above a nearly-black , clear vermillion body ; the head displays pretty good retention and leaves lovely cobwebs of rich lace as it recedes . gorgeous porter .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : one finger head of poor cream , bad thickness , and abysmal retention . the retention is forgivable for the abv . sm : sweet mother mary bejaysus , this is damn near straight alcohol . she 's like : i 'm alcohol ! i could sterilize fetuses ! a bit aversive .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : almost black with ruby light comeing through it	0000000000

1	a : simply put , this is one of the best looking beers i 've seen . pours a vibrant amber , with a creamy , spongy looking slightly off-white head . some of the best head retention around , stuck with a one finger for a while , giving way to layers of rings of lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : this is one inviting brew . brilliant orange/copper color with loads of tiny bubbles that create a bit of haze . solid white foam that lingers and then settles into beautiful ring present all the way down to the last sip . the lacing sticks to the glass and stays right where it landed- no movement what so ever . just a wonderful looking beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a dark mahogany-ruby color ; its translucence is immediately apparent in the small pour . the tan head is surprisingly generous for what is ( later discovered to be ) a nearly 10 % beer . retention is ok , lacing is poor .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : bright yellow body with a billowy snow white head that slowly collapsed in on itself in valleys and craters . thick tide marks showed the progression of my enjoyment . flavor : light malt flavor balanced by a crisp hop . a pilsner taste that lingered and faded into a slight citric flavor ; slightly lemony .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : hazy golden glass holds a respectable thin white cover that fails to give lace and dropped off pretty early in the glass . flavor : wet grain base has a fairly sharp pepper note . some of the banana flavor comes back in but not nearly as much as in the aroma . some mild bubblegum comes out in the finish , but there is a lingering mild medicinal and apple aspect to the finish as well that didnt sit well with me .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : it is a very cloudy amber color with very little head .	00000000000000
1	appearance : this got my highest score for this brew because it really is a great looking beer . an aggressive pour produced three fingers of fizzy white head ( not very thick ) . the beer is a beautiful reddish-almost orange-ish hue .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : no justice is served by pouring this one at any cooler than 50 degrees - wow , is it impressive looking . deep , rich mahogany with hints of pomegranate redness , fairly clear when held to light . good carbonation . fantastic head , a full two-fingered topping of dense khaki cream . good retention and sturdy banding lace .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : it pours mostly black with 2 fingers of light tan head that holds very well .	000000000000000000
0	a : pours black with half a.finger.of dark tan head . it quickly fades , leaving behind a little lace .	000000000000000000000
0	a : a hazy straw into my trusted duvel glass with a finger of head that thins slowly and leaves little lacing .	00000000000000000000000
0	appearance : slightly cloudy dark gold body with almost no head . as i poured it i tried in vain to produce some kind of froth , but nothing was happening . very inauspicious , uninspiring beginning .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : its the same color going in as going out ...	000000000000
1	appearance : near pitch black beer with dark brown hues and a clinging tan laced head -- good retention .	00000000000000000000
1	appearance : a hazy , deep dark brown body with ruby highlights and a finger and a half of caramel-tinged head . it leaves a fantastic curtain of lacing that leaves the glass virtually opaque .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a deep golden hazy brown , with bubbles lining the entire bottom of the glass . a thick light tan head sits initially , but dissipates to a smaller , more manageable head leaving lots of sticky lacing . the bubbles continue to rise . this is a damn pretty beer . tons of sticky lacing as the beer is drained from the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark iced tea brown flirting with some ruby red highlights . tiny head that quickly fades to a small lacing atop the brew . ok.	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours obviously quite thick - crude oil . broken , dark mocha foam coats the surface and then dissipates nearly immediately . no residual foam . no lacing . the beer coats the walls of the glass and tans the window .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a golden amber with a nice thick head that disappeared quickly .	000000000000000

1	appearance : very dark with ruby highlights . brownish with hints of red in the head retention . flavor : focused on malt . a bit sweet with a very delicate hop bitterness .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : golden yellow with little haze , but hardly any carbonation and no lacing . too cold ? not sure what 's going on , but does n't look like a tripel to me .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : hazy amber orange with three thick fingers of creamy ivory foam with a little bit of an orange cast . head retention is great ( still there even as the glass is almost done ) and big , chunky lace is left . this is a trait of rye in my experience , and a good one . i 'm not thinking dipas get much better than this , visage-wise .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : c & c bottle pops and pours a light golden ale with excellent clarity . atop is a blanket of white head which is constantly refilled with a continuous persistence of bubbling .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : bright amber body topped with an enormous off-white head of wonderful retention that slowly gives way to thick sticky lacing and a thick creamy cover .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : small fizzy head that lasts a shorter period of time than a nervous virgin , it has the distinct color of overhydrated piss .	00000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a fetching hazy amber that triggers water bombs under the tongue .	00000000000000

1	a : dark copper-ish to dark ruby hue , coming with an effervescent , off-white frothy head which sustains brilliantly , supported by a constantly lively fizzy body .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a deep , smoky amber into my glass . small head contains very large bubbles - kinda weird . negligible lacing .	0000000000000000000000000

1	a : very dark pour with about a finger of brown head . looks to be creamy , without a ton of retention but nice lacing . 4.5	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : served in a 14-oz pint , comes with a super frothy dark head with a myriad active bubbles in constant motion , weee ! ! ! ! a bit over one finger of head , with great retention and minimal carbonation ( this being a cask , it is expected ) . color is a deep-chestnut bronze , like a dark barleywine . a pretty face is about the only good thing this beer offers ...	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : cloudy brown with little to no head .	0000000000
1	a : a huge off-white head of 5 fingers begins to wear out it 's welcome with a retention that could seemingly be measured in days . the cap appears light and full of air , eventually collapsing in on itself . as the head slowly pulls away from the glass 's edge , it leaves a sticky , perfectly intermittent web of lace . the body is 70 % opaque with a medium value peachy-orange hue .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a rich copper . almost no head retention .	000000000000
1	a : an intimidatingly dark brown , nearly black , with a thin , foamy , dark beige head that diminishes rather quickly , but leaves a nice trail of sticky lacing throughout .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours what initially appears to be a nearly opaque black , but when held up to the light , the ale is actually a clear , dark , brownish amber . this ale pours with a tremendous , rocky beige head that laces deep into the glass . it 's really a good looking beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : black with reddish-brown highlights , huge light tan head , good retention & lace .	00000000000000000

0	appearance : it looked like any other pale ale except i 've seen industrial light lagers with a better head .	000000000000000000000

0	a : looks like white grape juice with a slight haze to it small head good laceing	00000000000000000
0	appearance : poured nice with a good thick head . the beer had an orange-gold color that looked more like an amber ale than a pilsner .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : muddy reddish-brown body with a half in chi of coarse tan foam . ok , but uninspiring .	00000000000000000000
1	a : pours a cloudy sun yellow , with a perfect cap of white foam , great retention , with extensive lacing .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : golden color with a thin quickly dissipating head and barely hazy for an unfiltered beer really it 's completely transparent .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : poured into a duvel tulip , the huge voluminous head i expect on this beers filled 80 % of the glass . i love the look of the froth on this thing . its sugar cube white and has the big rocky body of freshly proofed bread yeast . it takes several pours until i get half a glass of the crystal clear pale yellow liquid and was happy enough to take a seat on the couch . clumps of the sticky foam stick around the inside of the tulip . it does n't get any better than this . 5/5	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a deep dark brown , almost black . a three finger tan head slowly settles to a spotty frothy cap , leaving a good amount of lacing behind .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a very cloudy orange amber . it was clear at first , but then i shitload of dregs poured out into my glass -- they do n't state that this is a very unfiltered brew . head is pillowy white with a creamy stickiness .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : looks just like the on-tap serving at a pub . dark dark dark brown . lovley creamy thick head that continues to keep you company throught the visit , and leaves light-tan lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a black body with tinges of brown & very thin head that quickly disappears .	000000000000000000
1	a : beautiful reddish-bronze with frothy tan head leaving a healthy amount of lacing .	000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a relatively clear , copper color . head is pretty weak , if you ask me . looks decent to start but if you blink , you 'll miss it .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this murky beer was a very deep brown with strong , reddish-orange highlights . the brown and orange head ( kind of odd looking ) lept up and filled a third of my glass . as it settled down , it became dense and very rocky , leaving chunks and sheets of itself behind on the side of the glass . there was lots of lacing throughout the other glasses as well . very nice looking .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this beer pours a murky copper color with a thin offwhite film that sits on top . leaves a decent amount of wispy lacing on the side of the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours hazy pale gold with negligible head and lacing . searching through the haze , i find the beer quite bubbly .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : the beer poors kind of ugly ! i mean its a nice darker golden color , so its not a `` helles '' which literally means bright , and the head is a spattering of bubbles , sub par lacing ...	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a hazy copper color with a orange tint and small but foamy head .	00000000000000000

0	a : urine tinge amber , very little head that dissipated . typical macro lager uninspiring coloring .	000000000000000000
1	a : pours like an imperial stout : pitch black in the glass , touches of brown , a mocha-colored head . retention is on the longer side for an imperial stout , with the cap sticking around for a few minutes before lapsing into a thick donut around the brew . lacing does n't stick much , but it does leave nice sheets on the glass during a swig .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : deep honey , amber in color . bits of yeast floating about . absolutely no head or lacing . the tiniest bit of foam on top .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : attractive orange-straw color , with some haziness/cloudiness . head pours about 1 1/2 fingers thick , dissipated quickly . no lacing to speak of . i 'm docking points here because of the head .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : beautiful deep amber with mahogany hues . succulent 2 inch , fluffy white head that lasts for quite a while . carbonation is perfect , not too powerful and not too weak . looks just like a beer should , seductive and inviting . picture perfect for me .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a dull straw yellow with a slight haze . the head is thin and leaves something to be desired . very light carbonation .	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the perfect color for a pumpkin ale in my opinion . a deep copper/ amber color on the verge of brown , that reminds me of the leaves about to change in autumn . head does n't last long , but for this beer i do n't consider that a flaw because i was so enthralled with the color .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : bubbly white head billows up with the pour then disintegrates into a ring that clings to the sides . gorgeous golden with just the right amount of haze . color and clarity are perfect but head is weak . .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a beautiful golden hued , deep pink color . a slightly off white two finger head . the head dissipates fairly quickly , but retains a nice foam cap for the duration of the glass . moderate lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : its filtered , problem # 1 . problem # 2 it doesnt have the bright straw like color expected from a mild filtered or unfiltered wheat beer . instead it has a dark urine like color .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : jewel clarity and a warm , deep honey-amber color ; steady stream of small bubbles slowly rises to meet a foamy cream head that quickly dissipates to leave little/no lacing ; almost looks like apple juice after a minute or two	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : good finger of bright white head holds firmly . odd viscous sediment at the top of the glass at pour diffused into the formerly clear yellow beer turning it a uniform hazy dark gold . flavor : hearty wheat/grain flavor full of bubble gum yeast characteristics . a little banana flavor comes in as well . the grain flavor does n't really taste malty , and there 's not a lot of hop flavors going either ; all in all very well balanced .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : dark brown , with waaayy tomuch carbonation as it took about 15 minutes to pour to glass with a slow pour because the hed rose so quickly . the head was off white brown and fluffy	00000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : yellowish-gold with no head of which to speak . the most important aspect to note is the crazy amount of tiny yeast chunks suspended in the body . in all , this is sort of a flat , hazy , and somewhat uninspired looking beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pitch black body with a tall , dense , pile of brown foam on top . head retention is a m a z i n g. while i 've always loved the look of old rasputin , i 've never seen one quite like this . the nitro does some pretty incredible things for it . great lacing . fantastic colors . perfect !	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : light golden color . being an ale man , i find the color a little too light , but the light color just goes with the beer style . even so , it still seems light compared with a beer like heineken .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : the pour is a muddy and hazy amber color with no carbonation and a few bubbles after the initial pour .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : poured with delicacy , i have never seen such a frothy brew . huge chunks , big boulders of foam . lacing was out of this world as it formed intricate spider-webbing . beer is a deep , hazy crimson color	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a 100 % transparent straw color that produces a very fizzly and carbonated head that lasts for about 30 seconds and leaves no lacing along the glass . very standard .	0000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : small medium brown head that really resisted making an appearance . it was fizzy and did n't last long . the body was too dark to consider it 's clarity and if it was n't black , it was the darkest shade of brown imaginable . no lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : must be using a ton of dry hops cause it 's cloudy . amber-copper in color with a medium head that dissapates quickly . flavor : firm bitterness , but not over the top . citrusy , resiny hop flavor brings the hops to the forefront , but is backed by considerable maltiness , a little unusual since i am used to cleaner , drier west coast ipas . it 's a big beer and some residual sweetness suggests attenuation a little less than desireable , but the hops balance it well . sweeter finish , like a barleywine .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : dark mahogany , almost burnt brick . poured into a ommegang flute like chalice with a khaki head that does n't hang around a long time or leave a lot of lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pour is a hazy light orange , almost like a creamsicle . 3 inches of frothy head sinks slowly back into the beer . tons of lacing clings stubbornly to the sides of my glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pour yields a two finger , loose , thin , fizzy , pot holed , light brown head with half-decent retention . pretty lousy head really . dark brown body , clear , with some carbonation penetrating the wisp on top . head fizzes down to a thin wisp . a bubbly wisp remains until the end leaves no lacing on the glass . looks quite flat by the end . poor look .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : perfectly clear lite orange in color with a crispy white head .	00000000000000
1	appearance : pours a nice deep brown with some hints of crimson that is fairly crystal clear . topped by a very very thin head of wispy white head that vanishes instantly .	000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : excellent in all respects , color , carbonation , head , lacing . great looking stuff .	0000000000000000000
1	a : brown/black with a light brown head . head dissipates over a couple minutes .	0000000000000000
0	a : pours a hazy orange yellow with a minimal white head . below average retention , no lace . a fair amount of floaties are in the beer .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : jet black , completely opaque , brown head . looks like a stout should look .	000000000000000000
1	a : had this in a bomber i brought back from a trip to washington . pours an orangish color with very good sized foamy white head . good lacing down the glass	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured a nice clear amber & selective yellow body with a creamy one fingered head , rises nicely . the lacing on this is outstanding .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a very light yellow color . not impressed .	00000000000
1	appearance : intensely black . a beautiful shiny black . 1/4 inch head that remains for a while . some lacing .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : oh jesus . an extremely small head after an aggressive pour that was composed of very clear bubbles and died off almost instantly . looks almost as flat as water .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark chocoalte brown . huge three fingers of very light tan head . solid web of sticky lace . decent retention .	000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : great head on this one . very fluffy that , after a few sips , recedes to a lower head . frothy would be the word for this head .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a jet black with a small one finger mocha colored head , big bubbles and falls very quickly into a thin foam ring around the edge of the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : extremely pale yellow colour , as clear as water . active carbonation is shown from the large amount of bubbles rising to the top , a big white foamy head forms and leaves a one fingered white lace for most of the time the beer is around before it is consumed .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured with a large off white foamy head composed of large bubbles , which dissipated quickly leaving almost no lacing . the beer is slightly hazy with a orange/yellow golden color .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours into a becker glass completely black in color . a light mocha-colored head forms on top at about a finger 's height . it slowly drops to a full , thick cap .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : light copper color with a 1 finger head .	00000000000
1	a : clear amber , w/ light effervescence ; fluffy tan head that falls slowly and leaves thinly dispersed lacing .	000000000000000000000
1	a : it had a cloudy , organgeish yellow body with a massive three finger head consisting of tight sticky bubbles . the head receded slowly then retained as a thin cover over the liquid . there was a nice leggy lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : one finger head of barley any cream , good thickness , and pretty good retention . a bile green murky colour ( i shit ye not ) . certainly an exciting appearance . sm : more artifical lime citrus ester than cactus , but some cactus does pull through . i know because i 've eaten cacti before .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a hazy golden amber with a frothy head constructed of individual , very fluffy bubbles . lacing is beastly . darker than expected for a single .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark murky brown that started with a fizzy tan lace that did not retain at all . does not look very appealing at all , certainly not like a beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : solid mahogany color . rich foamy head -- a few fingers ' worth , slow to subside . inviting and mysterious .	000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : 2011 -- pours a clear ruby-mahogony with a finger of khaki head recedes into a thin ring with no lacing . 2010 -- pours a brown-mahogony with two fingers of khaki head that recedes into a thin ring with no lacing . 2009 -- slightly darker still , but other than that the same .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : against natural lighting appeared a golden-honey with a brilliant clarity , enough so to easily read the finest of text through . random instances and burst of carbonation appear while the head was dirty white in color , porous and soapy in appearance , while short in execution .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : i decided to pour this big time hoppy ale into my samuel smith imperial pint glass . maharaja poured a murky apple cider reddish orange color . if there was n't a head of foam on this beer , i could have sweared that there was a pint of apple cider in my glass . loved that color ! sitting on top of my apple cider colored beer was a beautiful creamy 3/4 to 1 inch head of white foam . now for the confusing part , the color of this foam . this white color was somewhere in between being a pure white color and an off white color . i did n't know such a shade of white existed , but thanks to maharaja , now i know there is one . this creamy head of foam had excellent slow retention that left behind a long lasting milky white film and a huge amount of sticky white streaks of lace . a top notch appearance !	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : beautiful copper color with clumpy white head but scant lacing	000000000000
0	a : cloudy honey in color with a bit of yeast seen in the glass . head is ok for the style .	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a clear , deep , orange-y copper color with plenty of bubbles from the carbonation . a somewhat rough pour only produces about a cm worth of head , and that fades very quickly leaving behind absolutely no lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this is a gorgeous looking brew , amazing head retention it just about sticks everywhere . bright and tawny great clarity .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : probably the worst single aspect of this beer . when i first poured it out of the glass i thought they accidentally put in corona . head is overcarbonated and fizzy typical of a macro brew . the head drops to nothing after only a few seconds . very weak lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : nothing to see here , literally . you 'd have to have a side-by-side with a glass of water to spot a difference .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : deep copper color with compact , dense and full head , tiny bubbles , clear	00000000000000000
0	a : pours a hazy orangie with a white head that quickly dissipates into a small white lace .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured with barely an pinky of head , that did not retain at all . no lacing has been produced with this offering and to be honest the head i did get was not at all creamy like you 'd expect from a stout . body is a dark black with notes of brown .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a nice white finger of head with perfect pilsner color . i mean this is basically the perfect appearance for the style . there is even some lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : opaque brown with a hint of orange ; 1 '' head that is an off white which laces the glass nicely .	000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured a very light golden color with a little head that quickly dissipated . this was probably the lightest beer i 've seen in a while .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured a beautiful translucent red . when held to the light i picked up tinges of pink and orange . the & lt ; 2 finger head was almost white with the faintest hint of pinkish red . the head dissipated quickly and left minimal lacing . i was really excited by the unique color .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : auburn in color , good clarity , reddish highlights . the head disappears within seconds of pouring , a byproduct of the 11 % abv and cherries i 'd guess .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : golden appearance that pours 50/50 liquid and foam . i rated this 5 on appearance because this beer has the best head on a beer that i 've seen . it is rocky and tightly beaded , leaving a lace as it slowly recedes . also has clarity .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured an orangish amber color , not much head , no lacing down the glass	00000000000000000
1	a : looks great , deep red , very vibrant , with a nice off-white head and great head retention . fantastic lacing .	000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : yellow with a thin white head ; not too impressive looking	0000000000000
0	a : blond color and big foamy head that quickly disappears , something cool , is that the bottle have a cap instead of cork ;	00000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dark amber orange . definitely malt-centric from its appearance . however , the head was quite possibly one of the worst examples of head i 've seen . even for a mid-sized brewery lager , its poor . disappointed . a brewery like boston brew should be expected to do much better than this .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a slightly cloudy golden pour . huge , huge offwhite head with the most ridiculous lacing and retention i 've seen in a beer to be quite honest . there is a solid inch of head left after about 5 minutes of sitting . it never actually fully goes away either . i usually reserve 5s for the top stouts but this one is up there too .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : nice amber to reddish color . head retention is good , carbonation is good , lacing is good .	000000000000000000000
0	a : nice dark amber color with a small white head that quickly dissipates ...	000000000000000
0	a : yellow-gold with some haziness , with a low whitish head will little retention and no lacing	000000000000000000
1	a : ruby-tinted , active , large head quickly settled down to medium lacing and a bare millimeter of head . a nice popping fizz lasts a minute or two . the body is nearly black , blood red around the edges . really beautiful looking beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a beautiful , crystal clear , golden orange , with tons of bubbles and two fingers of slightly off-white head . the head subsided slowly , and left tons of lacing . this is what a pale ale should look like .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : hazy straw , fluffy white head , lots of lace .	0000000000000
1	a : looked very promising . ruby-black , awesome plethora of fluffy , off-white head . unfortunately , there was very little retention or lace .	00000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a really nice dark color with a thick creamy tan head . this is a fantastic looking beer .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : very attractive ruby red color . about a half-inch off-white head that fizzled off fairly quickly . nice lacing .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : a golden straw color with a 2 finger fluffy white head that has excellent retention and excellent lacing .	000000000000000000000
0	a : very pale yellow , clear , with thin , fizzy bright white head that disappears quickly to less than a thin cap .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : murky reddish-brown color . poured a 2 finger light head that fell to a broken skim . lightly decanted . laced in thick , broken rings .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark murky brown . big bubbles with a tiny head around the edges .	0000000000000000
0	appearance : very little to no carbonation . in and of itself not a a big deal .	000000000000000000
0	a : pours a half finger head of slight cream , fair thickness , and bad retention . colour is a transparent dark yellow . sm : caramel , some tame dark fruit ( albeit very little ) , too much malt , and some nuts . a moderately strong aroma .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear like a kolsch should be with a straw/yellow hue .	0000000000000
0	a : pours a lazy red into my pint glass , with a small white head , no lacing .	00000000000000000000
0	a : one finger of foamy off-white head with big sudsy bubbles . above average retention leaves a sudsy film with lacing already grabbing a hold of the glass . the body is hazy , if not murky ( around 25 % transparency ) , and a rustic orange and brown combination of colors . lacing in nearly entire sheets . some light-colored small flecks of particulate hover in the beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a careful pour yields an impressive , jet black beer with a dense brown head which hangs around a while .	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a very golden amber color . a foamy white head with very good retention . plenty of raising carbonation in the pilsner glass . beautiful .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a muddy burnt orange . no head no bubbles , like a liqueur . hard to rate this aspect .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : i have never seen a beer with more full lacing in my life . pours with a huge 3+ finger white fluffy head that has great retention and layers with every sip . golden body . exceptional is an understatement .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : golden , transparent , but with less than average head and lace retention .	0000000000000000
0	a : pours a light , straw yellow with an ample white fizz head formed from large bubbles and settles quickly .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : amber orange , hazy , no head	000000000
1	a : bold almost opaque yellow , with 2 finger white head and substantial lacing	000000000000000
1	a : opaque black , showing dark brown at the edges , with over one finger of diminishing beige foam head . heavy lacing remains on the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a motor oil black with a 1 finger bubbly dark tan head which settles nicely without dissipating completely . nice lacing . looks very thick . this is what i expect an imperial stout to look like .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : brown to dark brown . decent head but not very long lived . no lacing .	000000000000000000
0	appearance : rhubarb sauce colored liquid with a short-lived , fizzy pink head .	00000000000000
1	a : nice orange color with a mild bit of carbonation that comes up from the bottom of the glass . a decent amount of head forms , half inch thick , with very nice lacing webs that remain . the head retention was decent	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : this beer seems to suffer from a lack of carbonation as it poured with half a finger of head that neither laced nor retained . the beer itself is your standard lager gold and boasts clarity as expected .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : the bottle itself is small , blue , and unassuming . in fact , i 'd go so far as to call that delicate vessel attractive . what lurks inside , however , is repugnant . upon removing the placebo seal around the cork , and then the cork itself , i was greeted with no evidence of carbonated life . i did my best to pour the beer evenly into two glasses , and it lived up to its reputation : it looked like fetid pond water , rife with suspended algae and the long-rotting carcasses of various aquatic fauna . chunks of thick sediment clung to the insides of both the bottle and each glass . the end of the pour yielded an audible `` plop , '' the result of a slimy wad of what appeared to be manatee feces entering the glass . my god .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a copper color with 2+ fingers of head .	000000000000
0	a : poured into a pint glass , has a deep amber color with a fizzy effervescence that rose and fell pretty quickly . no lacing to speak of .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a two finger head of fair cream , good thickness , and good retention . colour is a hazy nontransparent dirty gold . sm : biscuity yeast , caramel , light fruit ester hops , and cream . a mild strength aroma .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark murky medium to dark brown body with absolutely no head on it . even with some vigorous swirls i could n't get any head to form . naturally , no lace or retention either . for being bourbon barrel aged i ca n't fault it too much as the barrel tends to kill some visuals , but it 's still not very attractive .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a nearly opaque black color . a small bubbly tan head forms , but recedes in a second . no lace . just a dense , black liquid .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a cloudy pale yellow with a very minimal 1/4 '' white head . no carbonation activity , no lacing .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy apricot ale with under a finger of fleeting white foam . this leaves and etched surface . rare spot lace .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : kind of like a flanders oud bruin . sort of ruby brown . no head , no lace .	000000000000000000000
0	a : one to two finger head of relatively little cream , good thickness , and good retention . hazy gold colour . sm : fruit esters , malt , and slight cream . great subtlety , but me broken nose ca n't quite place distinct notes .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a reddish amber with virtually no head . the color is warm and very attractive , but the lack of head greatly reduces the beauty of the pour .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark brown with some very obvious reddish/amber undertones towards the bottom of the glass . somewhat clear though it 's certainly dark enough to not see completely through . a huge frothy beige head forms and sticks around for quite some time . nice slow dissipation with great retention and some nice lace .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : crystal clear ruby-brown body under a finger of tan foam . great retention and lacing . lovely .	00000000000000000000
1	appearance : cloudy golden-orange body with a fluffy slightly bubbly white head . flavor : mild singular malt taste . only a faint hint of bitterness on the back end . some citrus and spice notes throughout , but the dominate flavor is wheat and orange .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : about a one finger head , with some of the better retention i 've ever seen . some constant carbonation is floating through this deep brown body - really unlike a color i 've ever seen .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : black , no head	000000
0	appearance : this would be a 1 if not for the initially impressive head , which is tall , dense , and snowy-white . body is far , far less appealing , probably the palest , most sickly-looking beer i 've ever seen .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark black with a dirty white/light brown head . after agitating the beer i got about 1/4 inch head .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : pretty rich black ... the slightest bit of red hue comes through on the bottom with the help of some light . a surprisingly long life on the head of this . about two and a half finger , creamy and sticky .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : if i had been handed this beer and not been told what style it was , i would have rated it higher than this . however when i read `` imperial stout '' on the label i expected something very , very dark , black , opaque . it is not the case here , it is a very dark brown ale . there is very little head to speak of , not even a finger . overall appearance is n't bad , it just does n't look like an imperial stout .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : say what you want but you have got to hand it to stone for making every one of their beers look damn amazing . this one is a gorgeous auburn brown color and semi opaque . a dare i say perfect rocky head forms which is a light tan color and clings to the glass about as well as it holds together . pancakes are ready .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours with a solid thumb of head with a decent amount of lace , although the fact i got it mainly in plastic cups on the resort instead of standard glassware might have contributed . carbonation is steady and is pretty much your generic lager yellow .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a deceptively carbonated beer . gentle pour yields a slowly rising , and rising , and rising 3 finger , thick , rich , mocha head with great retention . beer itself is appropriately opaque black , thick , and viscous . lacing is pretty outrageous . patterned , good legs , and great stick .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : bright copper body topped with a tight one finger head that quickly dissipates leaving light lacing , and only a modest ring of cover . i expect much more lacing from an ipa .	000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pale and bubbly . huge carbonation bubbles race to the top and demolish the tiny head that was built by a sturdy pour . crystal clear . crayola would call it `` straw . ''	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : tall fizzy head with large bubbles , a bit too much like soda . no lacing , head lasts about 60 seconds , then not a trace can be found . that 's a first ! oh well , smells good though . pale gold , a bit cloudy . no residue left at the bottom of the bottle after the pour . flavor : sweet malts , citrus , cinnamon and pumpkin . aftertaste is n't bad , mild citrus , slightly bitter veggie .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : a pretty vigorous pour yields a foamy pure white and weirdly bubbly head . the beer itself is astonishingly clear and the color of golden straw with only a single vein of lazy carbonation trying its hardest to hold up the head which fades into a thin ring with no lacing	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pale golden in colour , coming with a very creamy and thick off-white head that sustains throughout the drink , on top of light carbonation - looking superb !	0000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a murky white that seems to glow from somewhere inside the body , capped off by an astronomically tall white head , into my hefeweizen glass . the head does n't dissipate like normal beers , but just clumps and floats on the liquid as it is being drunk .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : this beer pours a beautiful cloudy gold color with particles floating around ... a big three-finger head that leaves a thick spotty lace on the glass ... if you buy this beer , i strongly suggest that you pour it , because it is very hard to notice the beauty of this beer thru the brown bottle	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : fluffy white head rises quickly and stops short of taking over half of my tall pilsner urquell glass , even with a careful pour . the head is large and thick , it laces nicely as the head drops to a honeycomb concave surface . high levels of carbonation yield a milky pool when swirled . once settled the solid crusty head and pale straw body certainly lend a typical lager appearance to this one .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : poured from a one liter can into an irish pub style ( real ) pint glass on september 13th , 2010 , in low altitude galway , ireland . pours a thin head that quickly disappears . it 's a clear light yellow colour - you can see through it - and the carbonation appears a bit excessive .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : it is a very pale yellow color , lighter than the color of straw . it looks like pear or light apple juice . there is a white fizzy head that disappears as quick as a soda would . the beer is opaque , and eventually leaves no head or lacing at all . it looks like fruit juice in the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : deep amber in color with a light tan head . the head is long lasting . good lacing . i 'm not sure i like how they call it an india pale ale right on the label , when it 's so dark . i want to compare it to nugget nectar and call it a hoppy amber/red .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : very dark pour which gives a huge head , coffee colored . fantastic sticky lacing all over the place	000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a very hazy , sediment-ridden body that ranges from pale rose to deep reddish brown ; on top there 's half an inch of fine white foam that comes and goes instantaneously , leaving only the faintest ring . disappointing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear dark copper body with some orange hues in the light . a tight , small white head dissipates quickly and leaves absolutely no retention or lacing of any kind . dismal , bland and boring for the style , oh well .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours an extremely dark brown , almost black . about a quarter finger of mocha head fades right away . thin rings of lacing around the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : hazy golden brown . the bottle actually gushed a bit before i could pour , quite surprising ( thought only my homebrews did that ) . the beer had a very active head , intense carbonation that disappeared about 3/4ths the way through the beer . a small ring persisted , but did not lace the glass . flavor : first impression is the banana yeast , which mellows into a sweet fruity malt middle that has a mild hop bitter at the finish . fairly dry aftertaste . some alcohol noted , but very mild . some citric flavors come through as well , as the beer warmed , i noted an orange taste that was pleasing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : i did n't have a small 12 oz . stange glass , so i decided just to use my 12 oz . pilsener glass that kinda looks like a small stange . the beer was a murky chestnut brown with a hint of honey to it . all i got was a small skim of white almost tan colored head of foam . it dissipated away too fast leaving behind a few white rings and no lace around the glass . i sure hope it was n't me using the wrong type of glassware that got that small skim of foam and no lace .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours a crystal clear , pale golden yellow . very very light , but has a brilliant colour . fizzy bone white head with not much retention .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : the color is the only part where the appearance gets points , there 's a nice dark ruby colors but other than that it looks like soda ; dismal head and syrupy with a hint of carb .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear golden orange copper colored body with a rich and creamy slightly off-white head . a thick retention cap lasts throughout and amazingly splotchy patches of lacing on the walls . this is just a seriously killer looking beer for an ipa .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this baby is black ! oh man , the pour was a dark mofo . a mocha head with very light lacing . there is no seeing through this beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : poured from a 22 oz bottle into a 19 oz crystal sniffer . this beer is just glorious in appearance . a beautiful golden orange color with equisite dancing carbonation coming from all sides . a perfect 2 cm white head that has the best head retention on any beer i 've ever had . i drank this one slowly and after an hour and half there was still a thin head on top . the 2 cm head lasted for at least 30 minutes . sweet sassy molassy , it is pretty . the head is made up of very fine bubbles that make it look so creamy but keeps it stiff . it was artwork in a glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a light tan head and a black body . light is able to just barely shine through . the head is really thick and creamy , it practically paints the sides of the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a light amber color , well , depending on the lighting it gets a tad darker , but the head is non-existant , and doesnt lace ...	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured with a small head that dissipated quickly to a thin film . no real lacing to speak of . body is an amber/brown color , and almost completely clear .	000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours an orange color , huge head like most of the glass huge ... about 5 finger widths .	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : very clear light gold , with a slight warmth . pours with a light fine bubbled head that dissipates quickly leaving light lace . appealing . flavor : dominated by a metallic sourness of a single focus . lacking in complexity . moderated by a warm fuzzy moldy summer fruit ( peach like ) funk . finishes slightly astringent and papery . completely fails to deliver on what small promise there was in the aroma and appearance .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours the darkest shade of brown possibly with no head and then suddenly loads of dark brown froth explodes . a healthy lace swirls like a hurricane and an 1/8 inch ring coats the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : pours a slightly hazy yellowish amber color with a few floaties ... maybe hops ? ... i hope . there was about inch of creamy foam on top of the beer at first pour . the head retained for a couple minutes and was sustained by quite a few bubbles rising through the murky liquid .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear , fizzy , pale yellow brew gives a big 3 '' of white head that settles after a while . actually a pretty good looking brew . head has decent retention , leaves spotty chunky lace and forms interesting 3d structure as it degrades .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a mildly cloudy golden/light amber color with two fingers of fluffy white head . a layer of head remains .	00000000000000000000000

0	a : clear pale yellow color with to much head but good lacing down the glass .	00000000000000000
0	a : thin , watery , and yellow . kind of like what 's produced naturally after consuming beer . fizzy white head that dissipated quickly .	000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : next to no head , and when it did occur it disappeared almost immediately . the body is a slightly lighter then average blonde that has some steady carbonation .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear dark reddish brown , with 1.5 fingers of bubbly light tan head . the head fades pretty fast , but leaves a thin layer on the surface . looks pretty nice .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pretty clear , golden or light amber color . three-quarters of an inch of head reduces to a thin , white layer . lacing mostly disappears but a minimal amount sticks around .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a brown color into snifter . huge and i mean wholly crap huge head ... took me several minutes to let the head disipate so i could drink it , good lacing down the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : orange-amber with off-white thick head that laced nicely . when first poured , lots of effervescence was evident as a continuous stream of bubbles continued to rise up to the head .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : just a ring of lace lays on top , occasional bursts of carbonation after sipping give the lace some retention . nearly black in colour and a bit murky as well .	0000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a dark , turbid brown , with a huge , voluminous white head , almost like a duvel in size , which leaves generous lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a tad lighter than i had expected . the bottle obviously gives no hint to what is inside , but i was expecting something a bit more amber . a beautiful head is formed on the initial pour and holds wonderfully throughout the entire tasting . roughly a 9 srm . scent : the first thing i smell is a hint of that traditional belgian funk . nothing that takes over the beer , but just enough that says , `` we are now landing in belgium , i hope you enjoy your stay . '' the next thing on my nose is fruit . there 's banana from the esters , but also something sweeter , tropical , berry-like . we are talking bubble gum esters here . underneath all bubble gum is a malt driven beer that is just asking you to take a sip .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : deep golden , a little murky , inch of white head . spotty lace , head dies down to a very nice creamy layer . beautiful beer , looks like a mead or cider with a think layer of cream on top .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a clear amber color with a good size layer of off white head . good retention .	00000000000000000000

1	appearance : crystal clear orange-gold body appears completely calm : no carbonation can be seen at all . the head is quite nice-looking : foamy , creamy , white , sticky ; looks like something you 'd see atop a good latte . lots of lace to be had , too .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : ruby with chocolate hues , though this beer takes on brilliant strawberry pink hues under light . pours a big one inch head , with sticky lacing and good suds . medium visibility and low/medium viscosity . the development of the beer under light is pretty unique and impressive .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark brown , nearly opaque , lovely cappuccino-colored head that falls into a persistent cap with nice lacing .	000000000000000000000
1	a : as the `` twilight '' hints - this is a dark dipa , medium chestnut brown in color with a long retained khaki head , heavy curtains of lace adorn the glass walls , gorgeous	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : looks like a less watery king cobra	000000000
1	appearance : pours a brown colour . vigousous pour leads to a thick off white head , lots of retention .	000000000000000000000
0	a : dark , translucent deep brown . like weak coffee . no head , no fizz at all .	00000000000000000000
0	a : black color . big fizzy light brown head degrades quickly to look like dish soap suds then further to nothing but dish soap lacing . one of the worst looking stouts i 've ever seen . 4.0	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : bright golden orange color . quite a bit of sediment floating around in the bottle . minimal white head with a decent amount of lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a crystal clear pale gold with a fluffy white head on top . the head settles to a full cap with tons of spider web lacing covering the entire glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : hazed pale orange body with some golden marmalade thrown in for good measure . big head on the initial pour , but it soon runs away and drops down to a thin broken scattered junk yard of froth . streamers add some excitement to the boredom .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : medium cloudy amber color . very small head that fainted rather quickly which was a tad disappointing because i like bigger ones on wheat beer ( a weizen glass could have helped with this probably ? ) . decent small lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured from a 12oz bottle into a paulaner weizen glass . even with a delicate pour , there was a massive , 4 plus finger head ... .which sucks because now i can barely sip the beer . i dont know , this would be great if it were duvel , but hefeweizens should not have monster heads like this . cloudy bright golden color with strong carbonation . i did n't shake up the yeast on the bottom , so it 's not quite as hazy as it could be .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : this is one good looking beer . red with a cream colored head . leaves good lacing throughout . no haze or sediment . few tiny bubbles seen .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the beer pours brown in color with a small off-white head .	00000000000000
1	a : pours a nice amber color with a reddish tint ( semi-transparent ) and 1 1/2 finger head that is retained . the head began to conjugate in the middle after a minute or two . moderate lacing left on pint glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours with an inch white head , dissipates fairly slowly . very clear , yellow-gold color . some lacing . flavor : sweet corn and grainy flavor masked somewhat by a harsh bitterness . some astringency .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : anaemic , and a thrilling installment of the great disappearing head mystery .	000000000000000
1	a : exceedingly dark brown , nearly black . thick , frothy head with lots of lacing . a very good start . 3.5	000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a completely headless deep brown body . a few bubbles line the edge of the glass just after the pour , then no bubbles at all , just a flat , lifeless top . no lacing is formed . no carbonation is visible in the glass either .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy gold body , initial 1 '' white head quicky reducted to 1/4 '' & then stuck around for the entire glass . left a little lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a thin whitish head that was gone as soon as it was there . the beer itself is a ruby reddish color , like the meat of a grapefruit .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : very dark brown , gigantic head that cascades almost like a guinness , tons of head retention while i drank , tons of lacing .	000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : clear dark copper color , moderate white head , fast fade .	00000000000000
1	appearance : poursa nice dark brown/red , like stained cherrywood . two fingers of creamy tan head leaves some lacing .	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : perfectly clear amber with two fingers of off-white foam . nice and frothy with good retention and stickage .	000000000000000000000
0	appearance : capped and corked , a very firm but smooth pull dislodged the cork without disturbing the noticeable sediment layer at the bottom . despite this effort , the bottle slowly but inexorably started to gush resulting in the loss of about half the bottle and churning the sediment into every nook and cranny of the beer . after it settled for a while , it poured a hazy gold with a massive white fluffy meringue head that lasted longer than the glass did .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours an extremely dark brown with about an eighth of an inch of light brown head ( despite a rough pour ) that quickly vanished into the faintest collar .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : beautiful hazy yellow-copper with a towering , rocky two-to-three finger head and sheets of lace	00000000000000000
0	appearance : did n't pour out as dark as i had hoped , and once in the glass it 's completely transparent . body is deep blackish-brown in the middle and reddish-orange around the edges . a small , tan , foamy , head formed immediately , but it dissipated to a thin halo just as quickly . no lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : amber with a massive beige head that slowly recedes to a disk , leaving some sticky foam on the side of my glass . probably the best looking marzen of those i 've had in recent memory . crystal clear and gorgeous carbonation	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a one finger foamy bubble head with poor retention and ivory in color . the color of the beer is medium brown color with garnet hues . the clarity of the beer is clear to brillaint .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : an easy pour into my dfh off-centered ale glass , and the beer looks lifeless . the color is a light , cloudy yellow , and there is absolutely no head and no sign of carbonation . quickly looking through some other reviews , this appearance is pretty standard for this particular dfh brew .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : very pretty - like glowing straw with carbonation streaming from the bottom - a gigantic pillowy head	0000000000000000000
1	a : pours a delicious ruby-chestnut body with a light rose-colored head that rises to 1.5 '' . the head recedes into a thick collar and some filming on the brew , with washes of lacing that track each swig and slide slowly down the glass . magnificent .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured out thick , black and oily , forming a sinister char-brown red with red undertones . no light penetrates this beast ; it 's opaque all the way to the outermost edges . head retention is decent , it settles as a moderate-sized crown . stringy lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : black as night brew settles beneath a brown head , make thick from a vigorous pour . the strongest light ca n't penetrate that black body . head shows respectable longevity . as stouts go , it does n't get better than this .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours into glass a very hazy/cloudy brownish color , does n't let any light through the glass at all , small head that quickly vanishes leaving a blanket over the surface of the beer . some patchy lacing remains on the glass with every sip .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : this beer pours a dark shadowy brown color . not much head in this beer . what is there in terms of head is tan and quickly dissipating .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : dark amber , mahogany color with a moderate head . thick lacing that lasted throughout .	000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a gorgeous crystal clear medium brown that is highlighted by orange and gold . over two inches of tight white foam sits atop and is slow to dissipate , lacing my stone ipa tulip nicely .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : deep , clear red color with a very excited , very foamy white head that lasts forever . once in the glass this is a very impressive looking beer . great color on this one .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : deep ruby/dark brown ( almost opaque ) with a tall tan head that lasted .	00000000000000000
0	appearance : poured with a monstrously large amount of head that is reminiscent of a soft drink , and like a soft drink it did not stay around for more then a few seconds or lace . the body itself is a sickly pale yellow , that while clear , also seems to have small , lint like particles in it . the appearance of this beer looks disgusting and watered down beyond hope .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured nicely with a thick airy head , the color of coffee cream . the head thins out rather quickly , but thin lace ring retained around the edge of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : amber almost red color that is very clean and transparent . 1/2 finger white head quickly fades to a thin ring and a small amount of lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : holy crap , this beer is overcarbonated . i opened it ten minutes ago , and still ca n't fill the glass . every effort is repulsed by a tremendous avalanche of bubbles -- i waited until the head died entirely , then attempted to fill the glass several times with no success . i have no idea about quality control/consistency with watch city , but it looks like they rarely bottle their beers . this is supported by the very plain label with the alcohol content handwritten in black marker . anyway , other than the head , it 's a thick , cloudy dark brown .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dark brown without much of a head and with minimal , unimpressive lacing	000000000000000
0	a : pours an orangish amber color with a small white foam head that quickly dissipates . there is no lacing . a tad disappointed with the look .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : nice jet black murky color with a deep brown head .	0000000000000
1	appearance : jet black with a huge billowy lingering lacing head .	000000000000
1	a : highly carbonated like a true belgian . huge snow white head sits on top of an unfiltered golden hay colored body .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : medium gold color . clean with scores of bubbles making their way to the surface . head is medium sized bubbles and unimpressive . beer should n't fizz like sprite when you pour it .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours single finger head that dissipates quickly , leaving little foam on top . a golden honey color .	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : guinness is the archetype for stout , especially in appearance . watching the white head foam up out of the black body of the beer , waiting for it to settle out ... anticipation makes the drink that much better .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : foam on top was thin and white , disappeared very quickly . dark caramel brown .	000000000000000000
0	a : hazy ruby body ; totally flat . way too flat for a relatively non-ancient barleywine .	000000000000000000
0	a : pours a cloudy orange / copper color with a thin white head that fades quickly . leaves some trace lacing down the glass . has slow carbonation up the center . this is n't the best-looking ipa i 've ever seen ; i prefer clearer-looking ones . thankfully , appearance is now a small weighting in the overall score .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : it has a hazy yellow body with a thin white head . the head quickly fades to just a small ring of foam . lacing is minimal and slick , sliding right down the sides of the glass as i drink .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : two thick fingers of head with medium-large bubbles . looks quite carbonated from a not so long pour . a deep amber color , quite impressed by its majestic hue of sunset .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : that famous look -- dark brown to black , with ruby red notes at the bottom . the head is no more than a finger wide and is light tan and creamy-looking . it does n't just leave lacing , it leaves curtains !	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this beer pours a jet black with a two/three finger head of light brown sudsy , rocky head . on the first pour receded quickly , second pour it hung around a bit longer . some minimal wispy lacing is left .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pour is pale golden almost a bit straw-colored . the white head is rather high and a bit creamy . dissipation takes some time and leaves great lacings .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : nothing too distinct here just a nice golden look .	000000000000
1	a : at least this beer looks good , because that 's all it has going for it . a black pour with a nice fluffy mocha colored head on top .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : looks exactly like an unfiltered wheat beer should . a lovely , cloudy , pale atraw yellow .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a murky reddish brown with not much head at all . not particularly attractive .	000000000000000000
1	appearance : all good ; warm deep brown color , very clear , tan big bubble head . good head retention - moderate lace . i 'd estimate srm at 24 . flavor : malty , sweet balanced , with a bit of roastiness , initially pleasant until the back flavors come through . then it 's just strange ; a strong dirty metallic flavor , plus a tinny sharp metallic flavor that just does n't seem like something you should drink .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : even with about 3 oz reserved in the bottle , poured an opaque , copper-chocolate color . moderate cream head that dissipated completely . very little lacing . this style should typically be clear with a long-lasting head . this appearance is not typical of the style .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear lager , medium head , low carbonation .	00000000000
0	a : clear reddish clolor , disappointing head out of the bottle which dissipated quickly	000000000000000
1	appearance : one of the darkest black porters i 've ever seen . huge head , but it appears overly bubbly , like a soda .	00000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : free pour yields about 2 inches of fluffy , bone white head and 2 inches of beer . the head sticks around as long as that of orval or duvel , and like the beer it leaves thick , eternal walls of lacing . pours somewhere between dark copper and translucent ruby . really , this beer could n't look better .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : thin white head that dissapears quickly , dark brown but red in the light ( an `` amber '' bock that 's a dark lager ? hmm ) a nice color though .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : reddish amber color , fully translucent . minimal head with no retention at all . no lacing .	00000000000000000000
0	a : there was hardly any head and it only lasted for a millisecond . it poured more like a soda . i has a nice orange color . a little cloudy but it is a white . appears super carbonated .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark copper amber , poured with a nice head that died to a thin collar .	000000000000000000
1	a : pours with two fingers of white head . nice amount of lacing from the top of the glass down .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : muddy orange body with some sediment and a fleeting hint of white foam . pretty much as flat and boring-looking as i 'd expect from a vintage english barleywine .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : standard yellow gold body with a white , fast dissipating head . looks dreadfully over carbonated .	0000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a tainted orange with minimal off white head that very quickly disperses and leaves nothing	000000000000000000
0	a : pale yellow with a small head and little lace .	000000000000
0	appearance : murky brown . no head . hazy . looks like gruel .	00000000000000
1	a : deep , dark brown . 2 finger cocoa colored head . lots of lacing . beautiful , simply beautiful .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a cloudy orange hue , with good head retention . a bottle conditioned beer that might have got roused up during distribution , should settle out if left in fridge for a few days .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : `` thin '' looking . clear , looks like a light beer almost .	0000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a hazy golden color with a billowy head that covered almost all of the glass with delicate belgian lace	0000000000000000000000
0	a : murky , rather sickly looking pour , a grubby tan . among the more unappealing looking pours i recall : cloudy , thin head , scant film , lace is scattered at best . a roil of fizzy bubbles with each pour , gone in seconds - not winning any beauty pageants . a '3 ' feels generous ...	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : gorgeous , creamy head -- almost two fingers . ruddy amber-brown , clear in the light which highlights the thin streams of bubbles in the interior . good lacing . excellent .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours with 1 finger of big-bubbled tan head . this settles very quickly to almost nothing , just a small island of thin foam . the beer itself is a medium brown and nearly opaque in the center . a very small amount of sediment remains in the bottle .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours with a bunch of fluffy , slightly off-white head . very impressive for a barley wine ! there 's not a lot of retention , but it leaves a really nice lace . liquid is very clear , with a little copper/caramel colour .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : nearly faultless . rich mahogany color , incredibly puffy 1 '' head that lasts forever , nice lacing .	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : out of the can , it pours a very nice dark brown with some reddish hues . the color is very opaque and is contrasted by a big coffee colored head . the head has some great retention , and slowly starts to die down , leaving some thick lacking along all sides of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a slightly hazy reddish amber , almost with a crimson tone . less than half a finger of head , but i like the color so much that it 's hard to knock appearance much .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a very clear golden straw color with minimal head , lading , and retention .	000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours into my tall glass with an impressive 3 finger white head that dies back to a rocky finger leaving traces of lace before the first sip . glass is bright gold and like the label says , crystal clear . flavor : grain/wheat flavor is pronounced , hints of bubblegum and light fruit esters , slight lemon rind . overall , a clean and simple taste .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this is how a belgian beer should look . crystal clear pale body topped with a frothy white head and visible carbonation .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : out of the bottle , a very slightly opaque clayish red . decent foamy head that leaves a decent lace .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : poured into a snifter . poured a clear , but dark reddish-amber color in the glass . not much head , and it dissolved quickly into a collar of bubbles around the brew . no lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a light golden with a three-finger white foamy head . surpisingly good sustain with lots of lacing .	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : huge head that never ends with a soft coco color . nice lace trails while pouring followed by deep dark chocolate color to finish it off .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : always clouds in my beer , this is not chill haze , it was not ice cold . on a sidenote , why does appearance make up 20 % of the score and drinkability make up 10 % ? ? do n't we drink beer instead of stare at it ? ? i was not impressed with its color , it was a cloudy brown with a creamy head that would not go away until i started to drink it .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : brown red body , opaque , with little head but a stupifying amount of floaties . i have never seen floaties like this . not even in the fantome products .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a beautiful , golden butterscotch colour . hazy	0000000000
1	appearance : looks like black mud as it pours out of the bottle . thick . black . thick tan head . so thick not even superman can see through this beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy gold hue , slight head with almost no retention	000000000000
0	appearance : `` thar she blows ! '' upon popping the cork to a loud `` pop ! `` , beer begins gushing rapidly from the bottle . by the time it settles down , i 've lost 1/4 of the beer . having paid $ 25 for this one , i was not a happy camper ... 2 finger off-white head disappears quickly , like the foam on a glass of soda . the body of the beer is opaque , and resembles pink grapefruit juice . ( did the little penguin in my refrigerator shake this one up on me or something ? ) chunks of pink cherry pulp can be seen rising and falling through the side of the glass . flavor : puckeringly tart . lemon meets sour cherry meets musty funk . very reminiscent of an `` umeboshi '' ( japanese pickled plum ) . the acidity worked very well with the thin slices of gruyere that i enjoyed alongside .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured a nice thick black . held to light it has a nice hints of red peeking through . has a nice tan head that hangs out for a while . great lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a light yellow colour , with great head retention , i was surprised at this and leaves some nice lacing , a very good-looking pale lager beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : opaque black with the subtlest of amber highlights . great , frothy two-finger head , good retention , no lacing .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : pours gold with a fizzy white head with poor head retention .	00000000000000
0	appearance : poured almost yellow-brown but is actually a deep ruby amber brown . very pretty . clear . little to no head that quickly disappeared .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured with almost no head at all and what little there was dissipated in a matter of seconds leaving no lacing .	000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : deep dark brown , lackig had retention badly . poured really rough , flat	0000000000000000
0	appearance : arrives at the table with a hazy golden color and a modest head that did n't leave much lacing	000000000000000000000
0	a : does n't look like beer ! bright red almost pink . the head is literally pink	000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a reddish-orange copper translucent color with lots of hanging sediment visible . the head is a light and foamy off-white color with lots of staying power .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : first of all , i do n't know if i got a funny bottle or what , but this beer was straight up chunky . not `` just a little sediment at the bottom '' , but large off-putting blobs of what i hope and assume was yeast throughout the glass , in suspension , after i poured it into a stein . i actually strained it into a another glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : pours a pitch black color with a 1/2 '' off-white head . not much lace and not much retention .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : unfortunately , zon is the second beer from my boulevard sampler that did n't impress in the appearance department . the cloudy banana color gives a good beginning . a soapy eggshell cap forms on top only to disappear into nothing after a few minutes . a couple of wisps of lace were left behind .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : sky clear yellow colour with massive head .	0000000000
1	appearance : poured a hazy brown/salmon color that produced a small light pink head that disappeared leaving lots of bubble rising to the top . very unique .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : amber with a thin eggshell head . n : nothing but pure blueberry muffin . best smelling blueberry beer i can remember- inviting . some malt as well , nice .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : black as pitch with coffee-colored head . however , if placed to the light it emits a reddish glow , like blood . very impressive .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pale golden color with almost no head .	0000000000
1	a : dark red pour with a thick , two-finger width head . attractive , transparent appearance .	000000000000000000
1	appearance : medium brown body , very small head that quickly dissipated .	0000000000000
1	appearance : blood red color , slightly hazy , peachy colored foam , quite a huge and spongey layer develops on a moderately hard pour , lacy	000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : bottle 672 from 2006 . pours an amber brown into my aventinus glass . a very small head forms despite a vigorous pour . very few bubbles are left on the surface after just a short time . no lacing to speak of .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a deep red/brown color with almost no head . the little head that was on the beer did n't last at all .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear amber orange color . light head , no real lacing . n : light malts , bit toasty reddish crystal malts . light earthy hops , slightly fruity hops .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : it 's a very murky dark shade of oarange , nearly brown . there is a soft sliver of head , and no real lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear , deep amber beer with very thin head that dissipated immediately leaving no lacing at all .	00000000000000000000
0	a : bright yellow lemon/lager coloring with no head . i sure did get a lot of floaties too .	00000000000000000000
1	a : the beer looks decent , although a bit too light of a yellow color . the head is about what it should be ...	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : more transparent than what i was expecting . ( even for the style ) . white/slight yellowish head dissipated quickly . lacing did n't hang around much longer .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pitch black with a nice fluffy dark tan head that falls quickly and leaves minimal lacing .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : a black pour makes a really small , thinner looking , overly fizzy , tan head with terrible retention . vanishes in a snap . black body and zero carbonation evident . a slight ring remains most of the way , but it looks rather flat by the end . boring .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : really really watery , barely and color at all .	000000000000
1	a : poured a glowing orange color , cloudy with a huge white cap , lots of foam and mighty fine looking	0000000000000000000000
1	a : black , translucent body with dark brown glints . thin , fleeting head of off-white foam that settles into a ring . just fine .	000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pour creates a great looking dense head , very dense . it fades slowly , but almost seems to disappear the way it dissipates , and the fact that the head is so dense and frothy . some wispy swirls remain . the beer has a dark caramel color , very inviting .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark , hazy orange with a finger of dense white head that sticks around for the haul . it leaves a solid sheet of white lacing down the sides .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the head and coloring on this is flawless . beautiful thick rich creamy head that has staying power . never seen a head like this on macro lagers . color is not far off from an ipa .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : clear , pale golden color with an initial one inch light white head which dissipated quickly to a thin layer of foam .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : well , this one certainly isnt a looker . the body is a hazy rust red/brown , with so much haze that its almost opaque . no head whatsoever , just a ring of cream circling the outside of the glass ; theres literally just a mild discoloration over the rest of the beers surface . odd , but at least theres a nice web of bubble-cream as the beer starts to disappear . very thick and oily-looking , yet very flat .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours golden straw , with a almost non-exsitant head , very visible carbonation .	0000000000000000
1	appearance : mostly clear copper color with a large creamy off-white head .	0000000000000
1	a : it is black . that really does not do it justice though . this is the blackest beer that i have ever seen . the pour was in slow motion at it was really sticking to the snifters . more head than i thought would be on this beer . super deep mocha/ coffee colored . no lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a slightly hazy honey color with a pithy finger of white head even after a vigorous pour . needless to say , not much in the way of lacing , either .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pour a carrot colored body with a good head and plenty of lacing	000000000000000
0	appearance : it is a very opaque like a stout there was not much for head or lace . what foam there was just formed a ring around the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : i am wondering if we have some type of a bottling condition discrepancy with this one . absolutely stagnant in the glass ! i poured vigorously , as always , and could not stir an ounce of motion . it says bottle `` batch-74-number . '' not sure what to think so far , i am considering aborting this post , but i guess i shall carry on . maple syrup in color with deep reds , nice color	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : about as dark as you can imagine a beer looking . except for at the edges of the glass , no light gets through at all . small brown head leaves some lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : clear straw yellow with a thin , fizzy head . looks like your typical macro .	000000000000000000
0	a : deep brown , murky , very little head , carbonation is there but ever so slight .	0000000000000000000
0	a : fizzy yellow straw beer with a white fizzy head that had zero retention .	0000000000000000
1	appearance : pours out like used motor oil from a 65 mustang that burns oil ! good head , about a finger or so . honestly it just looks pretty	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : murky honey-like color with very active carbonation . forms a huge offwhite head composed of large bubbles . it eventually settles down to a small layer of bubbles after about 5-6 minutes . this remains for a good while , at least the majority of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear amber in the glass . nice foamy head that retains moderately , lapsing into a thin film on top of the brew . foam lacing down the sides .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : nice true golden color with a decent sized head that dissipates fairly quickly .	0000000000000000
1	appearance : black body , white half-finger head that dissipates to very little lacing	00000000000000
0	a : pours a one finger head of bad thickness , no cream , and decent retention . colour is a cloudy yellow . sm : clove , banana , and wheat . a light aroma .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear , dark mahogany , tan rocky head has above average retention and good lacing . unfortunately , it goes downhill fast from here ...	000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : clear reddish brown color with thin , off-white lacing for a head . the carbonation slowly drifts to the top , almost like it does n't want to go . the head thins very quickly and swirling does n't really revive the head . it has no stickiness to it and barely stays together as on clump of bubbles .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : standard pour produces a .5 finger foamy white head with poor retention . beer is a clear , kiwi brown . lacing is stringy with decent cling .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pouring creates a swirly cloud of foam that looks like milk being poured into espresso , in beautiful , downward-moving cascades of soft , creamy bubbles . foam comes to rest in a luscious , impossibly dense and creamy almond-off-white head with incredible retention . the whole thing is smooth as silk . a very , very attractive brew .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : first off , as others have noted , the appearance is actually rather pleasing . it pours a very clean looking golden/ pale yellow with an impressive 3 finger head . retention was nice , and as it started to fade it left a great deal of spiderweb like lacing around the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a dark amber with a finger and a half of fluffy foam .	0000000000000000
0	a : muddy brown color , tiny beige head that settles quickly , minimal lacing .	0000000000000000
1	appearance : poured into a duvel sniffter ; black as night , overflowing tan head , good retention and lacing .	000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a pale , golden , hazy color , like a witbier or other wheat beer . has a small , white head that dissipates quickly and leaves some spotty lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : the body has a pale hazy orange tan color with a small white head . the head fades out quickly leaving nothing behind and making no lacing at all . inside the body there are a few small deposits of yeast floating around .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : deep dark brown to black in color . no head but a sparce line of bubbles barely formed a ring around my glass . no lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : turns up a one finger medium looking tan head with decent retention . black body , though it 's relatively thin and clear for the big abv , with basically no carbonation evident . head quickly fades to a wisp and a ring . only the ring remains until the end but leaves no lacing down the sides . a little lack luster , and not quite thick enough for what it is .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a crystal clear straw yellow with a creamy one and a half inch , creamy white head , good solid ropes of carbonation bubbling up from the bottom and does wonders for head retention which eventually bubbles away into a loose cap . could have benefited from some extra lacing because there is not much here .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a good lucking translucent to clear amber with a moderate head and quick dissipation . moderate lacing .	000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a hazy amber with a big light tan head that lasts for a while and leaves ton of lacing on the glass . this is the best part of this beer unfortunately .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured a dark brown with not much carbonation and barely a head	00000000000000
0	a : barely any head on this one . gone in the blink of an eye . coloring is very coca-cola like . could all fit the style though .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : looks like your typical macro lager . pours a translucent yellow color with lots of carbonation bubbles . the thin , fizzy head dissipates very quickly leaving some spotty lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a solid black body , so dark even a flashlight was barely visible through it . a 3/4 '' slightly off-white head quickly fades to a tiny spot in the center and at the edges of the glass . lots of lacing is left on the glass , it almost looks like creme colored curtains .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a clear amber gold color w/ thin head that dissipates quickly . no lacing or retention .	00000000000000000000
1	a : pours black with a substantial mocha head . it looks like it might be infected .	000000000000000000
0	appearance : a dark pour makes a small , medium looking , overly noisy , tan head that quickly dissipates to a fain , splotchy wisp and ring . black body with ebony hues around the edges , and zero carbonation evident . a slight ring remains but leaves no lacing down the glass . head is unimpressive , and it looks a little flat by the end .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : amber/orange . it 's clarity reminds me of a precious jewel . pours a two-finger head which dissipates to a ring at the edge .	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : hazy golden in color . lots of bubbly carbonation and huge , soapy white head that has staying power ... has tons of nooks and cranies . great looking texture . once the head finally retreats into the beer , there 's a pretty thick film and lots sticky lacing . great looking beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a pale orange color ( not that bright ) with a minimal head and poor lacing which is to be expected . there are little floaters in the beer , not sure what they are , but i 'm sure it 's fine , just detracts from the appearance slightly .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : so my experience started out simple enough , and this beer looked alright . poured a deep dark caramel brown ; started with a 1/4 finger head that 's creamy and tan and fades quickly to nothing but a thin whisp on the surface ; body is entirely opaque .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a clear dark ruby-brown color with a 2 finger , dark cream colored head . the head settles to 1/2 inch and sticks around the whole time leaving a moderate amount of lacing on the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : this was a pale , golden-orange beer . the head was white and coarse , disappearing quickly and leaving no lace behind . toward the end of the drink , all that was left of the foam was a light ring around the edge of the glass . the beer was slightly hazey with thin streamers of yeast that slowly diffused out into the beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : wow , liquid tar pours out of the can and into the glass . this stuff looks like it could stain the glass its in . black as night . absolutely no light comes through ... the brewery could n't have said it better ... '' this dog 'll hunt ''	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours out brown and perfectly transparent . way too light and transparent for the style . makes a one finger , medium looking , tan head with decent retention . dark brown in the glass with medium carbonation evident . very transparent . head fades to a decent wisp and ring , but by the end only a faint ring remains and leaves no lacing down the glass . much too light for the style . disappointing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a flat hazy dark purple with absolutely no head . some small bubbles formed a weak collar around the glass after a moment .	000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : brilliant yellow in color , minimum but lasting bright white head flavor : good crisp hops up front ( floral , orange ) , some acidity , followed by a good base of grainy maltyness , and a pleasant bitter finish .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : it looks like grape juice . no head or lace .	0000000000000
1	appearance : deep orange , almost red . nice white head that is fairly stable	000000000000000
0	a : light hazy straw yellow . half finger white head with decent retention and lacing .	00000000000000000
0	appearance : a nice light tan head that has a 2 finger head with some retention . the body of the beer is a dark mahogany color with garnet highlights . the clarity of the beer is opaque with some highlights .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a very potent blend of fruity sweetness and peppery alcohol . honey lemon and sweet bananas are pretty detectable .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : i actually really dig the rich reddish brown of this beer . it 's unfiltered so pretty opaque . i did n't notice much lacing or head retention , but then , i do n't pay much attention to that anymore .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : racy head is not as bad as the previous two thiriez brews which i tried , but it does seem over-active . deep white head forms with a uniform topping at first , but it soon collapses in an irregular manner which produces a rocky surface . pale golden-yellow colored body looks thin at times , flashing with a faded straw look when back-lit . carbonation is like asti spumanti .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a clear orange ( this is syracuse , is n't it ) with a thick head that does a nice job stranding some lace	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a hazy golden honey color with a massive white fluffy head that sticks around and laces the glass . impressive head is like a cloud . beautiful looking beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear straw body with a thin , fleeting white head . mediocre .	000000000000000
0	a : hazy brown shish body with decent head that laces very lightly .	00000000000000
0	appearance : nice strong golden color with hints of copper present .	000000000000
0	appearance : cloudy golden-brown color with a slight amber hue . smaller white head that dissipates quickly and does n't leave behind any lace . does n't really look at all like a hefeweizen .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured dark brown with a moderate head . appeared thin . i was expecting a thicker beer for $ 16 a bottle .	0000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a rather murky looking burnt orange color with a small head of active tan bubbles that were disappearing as fast as i poured the beer with nothing to remain , really . there is a very small ring where the beer meets the glass . there is no lacing left on the glass after drinking .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a viscous pitch black . a tan head gently rises to at least 3 inches , and sticks around . sticky lace all the way down the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a lot browner than i expected . actually , more like a deep copper , with very few red tones if any at all . tiny rim of head , with not much lacing to speak of .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : the rim of the top is doused in yeast . head is three fingers , quite thin , has only slight cream , and retains pretty poorly for a trappist beer even factoring in the 7.5 % abv . colour is a solid dark brown-amberish . floating yeast particles abound . not particularly appealing . sm : yeast and nuts . a moderate strength scent . me broken nose ca n't detect distinct notes . all apologies , lads .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : not much head retention . no lacing either . typical porter shade - brown with red tint .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured dark black ... like there 's any other kind of black ... could use more head and lacing .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : clear , golden-yellow , with a ton of fluffy white head ( the 250ml bottle over-flowed the petrus glass ! ) . leaves some nice belgian lace .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : one finger head of little cream and decent thickness . retains alright . sm : cream , caramel , vanilla , butterscotch . very appealing .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : deep thick jet black , with a big fluffy medium brown head that leaves huge lacing . pretty much exactly what an imerial stout should and can be . yes : perfect .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a white wine yellow with an inch of quickly fading one inch bleached bone head , hadly even a ring at all on this one , bits of carbonation bubble up from the bottome of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours dark brown with a good sized head that makes a late entrance . plenty of lacing .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : amber glass , with maybe a suggestion induced purple bruising , has excellent clarity and holds a thin head that manages some respectable lacing before dropping to a scant collar . flavor : the blueberry note is pretty well balanced , not being overwhelming but up front and predominate . there is a light sweetness to the beer which complements the fruit . no hops noted . malt base is a bit toasted . mild bread flavor working as well ; total package makes me think blueberry bagel .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : holy foam , batman ! beer-to-head ratio is somewhere around 1:8 , even on a truly gentle pour . hmm ... well , head dimples down around the edges in an entertaining fashion , giving me time to enjoy the beautiful ochre styrofoam-like wispy lacing on the edges of the glass . beer itself is opaque-brown , with yellowish tints in the narrowest parts of the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear dark red-brown with two-finger , off-white , rocky head that lasted more than a few minutes . great lacing .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a very dark brown , with ruby highlights when held against the light . head is large on an agressive pour , but bubbles are enormous and the head sadly collapses very quickly to only a desultory ring around the surface . carbonation appears moderate .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : appears a brilliant clear copper with hues of red , creamy white 1 finger head , little lacing	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : light brownish/gold , hazy , poor head formation and not much retention of that which does form , a bit too brown for a wit	000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : hazy orange in color , no head retention and no lacing . nice color , too bad there is no head to speak of .	000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a nice dark brown with a huge fist sized head . this cork did not pop out with the same force as some other reviews but it did come out real easily . it took a while to pour this beer due to all the foam	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear , amber/yellow in color with a thin/quickly dissolving head . light to medium carbonation is evident . 2/5	000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very little head off the pour . the murky body sits calmly in my snifter , showing off brown edges and brash viscosity when held to light . white bubbles meander around the surface , but that 's it in terms of head ; looks flat . surprisingly weak glass-coating as well .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured into a glass : a rich golden-brown with a nice thick foam head . looks very appealing , especially when the light hits the glass just right . mild lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a cloudy golden color with two fingers of thick off white head . the head retention is quite good .	00000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours up a clear , brown body with a frothed , ivory-hued head .	0000000000000000
0	appearance : mildly cloudy , pale yellow color . it looks a bit like a cloudy budweiser or something . the head is about 2 fingers worth and dissipates quickly with little lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark reddish brown with some light escaping near the bottom of the glass . one inch of creamy lightly tanned head with good retention and leaves thick lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : poured a deep black with a tiny mocha head . by all accounts what a stout should look like	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : looks like a brown porter , dark mahogany , good clarity , thin head , not much retention ( but that 's not unusual for this style ) flavor : rather bland , some dark roastiness up front and a bit of a malt finish , not too much hop flavor/bitterness/aroma , quick finishing ( i.e.- the flavors that are there do n't linger at all ) , some graininess and a slight twinge of tartness	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : chocolate syrup brown with dense , oatmeal-colored 1-finger head that retains well and sheets the glass .	0000000000000000000
0	a : standard pour initially produces no head but one magically rises from the deep dark depth of this beer . .5 finger . it disappears almost just as quickly . possibly the blackest brew i 've ever seen . it not only does n't let any light through , it seems to suck up the light around it . lacing is spotty at best and does n't hand around .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : reddish dark brown color with very little carmel color head . very light carbonation .	00000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a startling contrast of yellowish at the bottom moving towards a dark orange copper near the head . cloudy throughout . the head is an off-white with tons of bubbles . it quickly recedes , but there remains quite a film around the tops of the beer and sticky lacing all down the sides of the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : back , tan head ,	0000000
1	appearance : super high score except for the head , the appearnace is of a great apple cider just made in front of you ( of course due to non filtered/non pastuerized ) , the lace isnt much to comment about , so no 5 here . carbonation seems ok on looking .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear than i was expecting and lighter too . a bright and clear copper and topped with a rather quickly disappearing bone white head .	000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : amber orange glass is topped by a good two fingers of head that started about 3 and a half and laced as it settled . flavor : coriander is strong , but under it i get some buttery biscuit notes and a hint of coriander infused hops .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours yellow with a surprisingly long lasting head for an adjunct lager , no lacing .	000000000000000000
1	appearance : a very nice yellow body with bronze notes , that while not showing much carbonation in the body , produces two fingers of head that both laced well and retained exceptionally .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a hazy light orange color with a soapy head . can see sediment suspended in beer .	0000000000000000000
0	a : fair cream and thickness , but bad retention . colour is a dark orange-gold . sm : cream , butterscotch , caramelized malt , and barley . a mild strength aroma .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours dark brown with a finger of tannish foam which falls over a couple minutes to a sheet of the same . spotty lace . limited clarity . ( 3 )	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : opaque purplish black color . just a tiny , tiny frothy beige head despite an aggressive pour . i 'll give this a bit of a break since it 's four years old , but there still should be more carbonation in this . 4.0	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear golden color ; decent head but no lacing	00000000000

1	a : poured into a mug . sweet hallelujah -- ruby red color , thick egg-white head , a boatload of lacing . this deserves a 5 , which i do n't tend to give very often for appearance .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : it 's funny that largadeer referred to this as looking like bile , because that was my first ( unspoken ) thought upon seeing the glass . it 's a murky puce body that does n't look all that appealing . swirling produced a nice head that lasted for a minute or so .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : when poured into a brooklyn brewery euro pint glass , this czech beer is a dark burgundy with a few dark ruby red highlights . the color was great , but the head of foam needed some work . it was less than a quarter of an inch in height and what appeared to be an off white color . it was too little to tell , but i 'm 95 % sure that it was an off white color . what little head of foam was there quickly dissipated into islands of white bubbles sitting on top of the beer . it did n't want to bother with leaving any rings or lace .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : the beer had a nice nitro head when served but the head discipated and left a little lace . i was n't sure why the head did n't last that long with the nitro .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : at first glance , it looks like a standard lager . but no ! look further ! it 's light and clear with a straw color , but the carbonation is abundant . the head is thick , white , and totally creamy . and it does n't ever dissipate . tons of lace are left on the glass by the finish . this is as good as a light colored clear beer can look . 5/5	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours black with a two-finger foamy head . good retention and lacing .	000000000000000
0	a : this is a murky yellow brew . virtually no head , very thin . cloudy and reminds me slightly of toilet water that has recently been urinated in ... i once asked someone `` what makes a beer look bad ? `` ... this would be my answer ... but i do n't give it a 1 as i assume there still could be something worse out there .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : crystal clear coppery amber in color ; good off-white colored head of about 3/4 '' reducing slowly into an uneven layer of bubbles . good lacing . it just looks pretty !	0000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : nice looking bottle . pale golden brown color with a soda-like fizzy head .	0000000000000000
1	appearance : pours an opaque black but as it 's poured i see some definite brown tinges . insanely thick , frothy head that 's at least 3 fingers thick with a light mocha color .	000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : an amazingly hazy brown body capped by a simply massive fluffy off-white head that measures over four fingers . i 'm glad i was a little cautious with the pour , otherwise this would have probably taken 20 minutes to get into the glass . the head fades slowly and leaves the barest patches of lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : the beer 's glaring weak spot . deep chestnut brown with nice clarity . however , a small and fizzy cream head struggles to form , retreats to a ring quickly and leaves no lace .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours black with two fingers of brown head . lacing lasts a few minutes .	00000000000000000

0	appearance : i watched that pour , and was quite disappointed at the lack of head this beer produced . the color was a plane dark amber , and overall this was n't much to look at .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured like a dream - was really excited to drink this after the healthy pour that came out . huge frothy head , beautiful reddish gold hue .	000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : i poured it fairly quickly , due to the note above , and it looked marvelous as the cascading effect allowed a thick , creamy head to form . after about a minute , a one finger layer of cream sat on top of a honey colored brew . i really enjoyed watching this .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours into an allagash tulip a deep burgundy brown with ruby red highlights . a 2-finger high light tan head forms on top and takes absolutely forever to drop . it settles out at a tightly bubbled , one finger high cap . lacing comes in a few spotty patches scattered about the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : comes in a big , badass , blue swing-top bottle , the usefulness of which will probably long outlast the beer it originally held ( i homebrew ) . pours a somewhat murky golden color with a decent head .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours with a satisfying `` glug glug glug ... '' an attractive dark amber color . big , frothy head . good lace . very nice looking beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : not too lively . with a color similar to water-dilluted urine , a thick head that fades within seconds .	0000000000000000000000
0	appearance : ew . sounds like rice crispies . looks ... nasty . fizzy white head disappears in a matter of seconds . color is light copper , and body looks very watery . after about 45 seconds , there is no head left - absolutely none . i 've only seen one amber this bad before ( wingwalker ) and it was made by the same brewery . go figure .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : jet black , as dark and opaque as the night sky in an arctic winter , with a thick , tan head , which leaves voluminous lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a moderate colored yellow . there is very little head retention . nothing impressive .	000000000000000000
1	a : a nice , light amber color with a foamy two finger head that sticks around for a while . nice lacing .	000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : clear and bright golden . looks like very little carbonation , i can see a few bubbles , but not much . head dissipates rather quickly leaving a layer of foam..and i can see some lacing stick to the top already .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : very clear orange/yellow color with what started out as a `` soda-like '' head that disappeared .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : piss yellow , with a finger length of foam that quickly dissipates .	000000000000000
0	appearance : solid golden . pretty flat . not much foam or carbonation , unless you shake it a bit or take a sip .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : appears a cloudy , reddish orange with a tan and dense head which leaves micro bubble lacing . i know they are going for the unfiltered thing to preserve all flavors , but this hazy red just does n't look the most appetizing.. its kind of murky	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear amber body . no carbonation , but it has nice legs down the sides of my tulip .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : this beer pours a solid copper color , minor sediment is visible in the class . a 1/2 inch of white colored head sits on top that recedes relatively quickly but leaves ample spotted sheets of lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : very clear yellow . lots of bubbles rushing to the top . soda pop-like head that lasted 20 seconds .	0000000000000000000000

0	appearance : after a fairly aggressive pour i was left with barely even half a finger of head , that of course did not retain nor lace . the beer itself is a orange and amber color that has a slight bit of haze and seems to be a bit lacking on carbonation .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : dark , opaque beer with minimal head from a fairly agressive pour . what little bit that 's there is tan/mocha in color and there are some legs on it from the alcohol .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this looks great : at first it 's all foam , then the white large creamy head starts to set and reveals a golden to amber beverage . the head stays longer than it takes me to finish the beer and it stays creamy the whole time .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a smaller medium looking tan head that slowly pops away to a thin film . color is burnt umber with some ruby hues . minimal carbonation evident . a thin film remains until the end but leaves no lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours just as black as i have seen , with a foamy khaki tan head .	000000000000000000
1	a : amazing . completly jet black , no light penetration whatsoever . thick tan head , at least an inch and a half that does not dissapear , it stays there for the entire duratation of the drink . i just recently found out that this was nitro-tapped and that is what gave the `` cascade '' head formation . it as amazing to look at and i found myself staring in awe at it for a long time before i started to actually drink it .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : a dark brown to burgundy color , almost carbonation free , looks thin - 2.75 ,	000000000000000000
0	a : what very little head there actually was recedes immediately amber color .	00000000000000
1	appearance : i got to say this is the highlight of this beer . the beer pours a nearly peach coloration . the head is big thick and biege . good retention is noted . very nice lacing remains behind on my glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a hazy dull orange color with a super frothy head that is just sitting there doing nothing , which is quite amazing .	00000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this brew resembled to every detail a very rich italian espresso , both the color of the beer and the color of the head . the beer is a deep espresso brown , with tiny espresso foam colored carbonation rising to the top . the head was thick , and ranged from light beige to brown . it settled fairly quickly , but left a nice lace in its trail . gave it a couple swirls and head bounced right back . so resilient !	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : hazy peach colored glass does n't hold a head for long , not much to look at honestly .	000000000000000000000
1	a : brown or a thin mahogany in color . pours with a very large , stable , light tan head . good lacing .	0000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : as i pour , foam starts very slow and i 'm wondering if i 'll much but near the end it balloons to a solid 3 finger head . and retains itself for a few minutes at least . lacing around the rim and coats the glass all the way down . color is a hazy , dark amber .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a two finger head of lovely cream , decent thickness , and fair retention . black colour . sm : hoppy body . caramel . vanilla ?	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the perfect pouring stout . nice large 3 finger espresso colored head that settles down nicely to a small pillow atop the brew . there is also very nice lacing down the glass . this one could make people ' magazines 100 most beautiful list .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : deep ruby red , pale , pink head just is no more than a thin ring around the glass . beautiful to look at .	000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : served a light amber with almost no head ( that was n't the bartender 's fault ) . what head there was disappeared before i had a chance to pick up the beer . the amber color was alright though , crisp and clear , similar to the taste .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : golden , yellowish-straw in color . small head compared to a normal hefe/dunkel/weizen . almost zero lacing as well . i was expecting aventinus but hoppy but this brew looks more like a hefeweizen .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a hazy , light orange/coppery color and starts with a huge 3 finger head that is very foamy and slightly off-white ; solid retention and the head leaves large , puffy and dry swaths of lacing as it slowly fadfes to a full and rocky skim that is about 1/2 finger deep still ; as mentioned , body is a little hazy but still shows strong carbonation .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a massive off-white head almost explodes out of the tulip . body is a cloudy golden , amber and orange with floating yeast particles . head retains like creamy foam and sticks around for 2+ hours ( yes , i 've been sipping on the beer for that long ) .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pour a golden-peach color with a couple fingers of light bubbly white head that faded into an oily film that left rocky lacing down the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000

1	a : what can i say ... perfect ! ! ! white one-finger head with a dark gold color . carbonation was visible and the beer itself was somewhat transparent . filtered quite nicely ! ! !	0000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : well , okay . i have to admit , i 'm drinking this out of a can . seriously , who pours hamm 's into a glass ? not me ! up the punx ! ; ) but it 's your typical american lager . that 's what it looks like . nothing special .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : this was one of the best looking pours of stout i can recall . i 'm usually not much for appearance ratings to begin with , but this thing looked gorgeous - thick , ruddy brown head that stood 1 '' tall on a 3 '' pour in my tulip glass . the head remained for at least 5 minutes after the pour .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : shiny transparent yellow with a thin but fluffy head . the lacing is not something i am usually impressed about but the rings that were left on this were the best ive ever seen from a beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : perfectly clear orange-amber body sits sparklingly beneath two full fingers of frothy eggshell foam . the head initially peers just over the rim of the glass , then slowly recedes and leaves a nearly full coating of thick , sticky lace . the properly branded glassware certainly does n't hurt , but regardless this is a spectacularly beautiful ipa .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : this is one of the nicer pours i have had in a while ... deeper in colour than they will often be , it 's almost copper but has a gold hue to it , as well . head is frothy , creamy , and has something of an orange hue to it , and it loves to hang around . retention is great , with a nice wall of lace left all around the glass and about a quarter finger of head remaining as it is consumed .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : im not quite sure how to rank the beer . it is bottle conditioned and carries a definite haze . i know this isnt stylistically appropriate for a pils but since this is an imperial pilsner , im not judging it to the classic standard . i still think that an imperial beer should retain some of the character of the base while exaggerating others . i am scoring it rather low in this category . the color is a copper with a slight patina which also doesnt correspond to what one would expect in the non-imperial version of this style . im not deducting any points for the color because this is what i expect when almost twice the normal amount of malt is used .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : the beer screams dipa . clear golden body ? check . finger and a half of white lacing ? check ? insane lacing ? check . the lacing was some of the finest i have ever seen . almost looked like a belgian ipa .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : slightly red hue and somewhat cloudy . has a nice head .	00000000000000
1	appearance : black , viscous , with a lasting brown head flavor : chocolate/coffee from dark malts , a bit of candied cherries , some slight oxidation , but not much in the way of typical bourbon barrel flavor . almost like a imperial porter but with more of a bite like an imperial stout .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : black body under a medium sized tan head . good lace and retention . good looking beer .	00000000000000000000

1	a : whoa , this head is fantastic . as soon as i poured , i knew it was going to be thick , but what happened next totally surprised me : the head stayed in place at the size of half my glass . it didnt appear to be moving at all . so i went and made a phone call , and , when i came back , there was still quite a bit of head to go . official time : seven minutes to move from half a glass to two fingers ! incredible ! and the lacing , too superb . add in its midnight-black color and this one has got to be one of the best looking imperial stouts ive ever laid eyes on .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : one finger head , devoid of cream , rather thin , and of average retention . cloudy dark lemon-yellow colour . sm : muted lemon esters are disturbed by bland hops , a restrained pine note , and pleasant tree resin/sap .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : thin brownish red with a solid white head , good retention , and great lacing . excelent carbonation streams . n : sweet malts and , uh , nothing else	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours an extremely dark brown , with some light coming through when held to light . less than a finger of light tan head formed after a pretty hard pour , and that dissipated pretty quickly . kind of disappointing in the looks department , actually ...	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : ultramirky deep dark almost purple brown with an eggshell white head .	00000000000000
0	a : pours a 1 finger frothy , white head with decent retention . beer is a deep , clear orange . lacing is sparse and with little stick .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : bright . clear amber color . poured a half finger fizzy white head that that dissipated quickly to a thin skim . decanted continually . no lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours jet black . no light getting through this one . minimal frothy chocolate brown head that disappears quickly . sticky brown lacing .	00000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a lighter orange/rust color which is kind of murky with the amount of sediment dancing around . not really an attractive color to me . a half-inch head develops which quickly dissolves to a thin layer of foam on surface .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured vigorously , which earned me a lofty head , at least 3-fingers , of bubbly/frothy light tan . it subsides after a couple minutes , resting then as a denser cream upon a pitch dark porter . only a sliver of mahogany-brown shows when held to strong light .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a rich dark brown with almost no head to speak of .	000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a very light yellow color with a 1 '' head that breaks down immediately . no lace develops .	0000000000000000000000
0	appearance : tonight i am reaching for one of my standard glasses in my cupboard , my dogfish head goblet which always creates a nice head due to the etching on the bottom . i proceeded to pull off the cage and pull the cork out and surprisingly it slipped out fairly easily . when the cork released there was almost no popping sound and this worried me right off the start but i went on . on the pour i decided to go slow and straight on trying to entice some form of head and i never got it . there is absolutely no bubbles or foam on this syrupy ale . when i hold my glass up to the light it is a murky hazy deep plum and brown color with no light passing through . something i noticed that was different was that there is a shiny sheen that catches the light every once and a while on top of my beer that resembles a oil slick . as typical i gave a generous swirl and was left with a fairly heavy lacing creeping down the glass walls .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : slightly hazed , medium amber body with an inch of fine , creamy off-white head on top . terrific retention , sticky lace . great looking beer .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a hazy orange color ( not sure if the haze was my fault from handling ) . dinky white head died pretty quickly . loads of carbonation .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a very light amber/orange with a hint of yellow on the edges , quick dissipating head with a bit of lacing	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : black as night with a coffee-colored head .	0000000000
0	a : clear , dark maple with less than one finger of diminishing off-white foam head . no lacing remains on the glass .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : this beer looks heavy . it pours slowly , and looks very viscous . its a nice copper/orange color . the carbonation appears light . bubbles from the bottom of the glass are having a tough time getting through the beer to rise to the surface . impressive . i thought this might be unfiltered , but its crystal clear . the head really sticks to the glass well .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a beautiful deep mahogany color . a large creamy beige head forms and gently recedes and leaves sticky lace down the glass .	00000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very hazy and not clear at all . kind of a brownish hue of orange , almost like an overripe orange in the fruit bowl . head leaves very impressive lacing that has n't budged an inch since the initial pour .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours black with no head . meh .	0000000000

0	a : poured into pint glass . just a little head on it , with a bit of lace around the rim . brew is a light , clear , copper color .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a slightly hazy bright golden color with a thick slightly off-white foam head . there is nice lacing down the side .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours with an enormous head that fills up most of the glass , rises over the edge , leaving maybe 4 oz of liquid on the bottom ... and i have n't even poured the entire bottle yet . the head is fluffy first and rocky later , ivory white in color and incredibly long lasting . huge peaks and craters cover the surface . as it eventually fades , chunky sea foam lace coats the glass . the body is rustic orange with medium saturation and very clear . very few interior bubbles .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : nice sized chocolatey brown head . real good retention and lacing . needless to say , the body is black .	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : solid black and thick as hell ( great looking stout )	0000000000000
1	a : outstanding . the beer looks dark as night when sitting on the counter ... however ... hold it up to light and you notice a wonderful ruby red translusence . beautiful . a medium tan 2 finger head sits atop it 's creator just waiting to be sniffed . it holds forever ...	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : has a roasted red appearence that is very inviting . poured smooth and looked rich and flavorful .	00000000000000000000
1	a : pours black . has a copper colored head .	00000000000
0	a : a sultry auburn pour with a fizzy , fast-dying head of whiteness . remarkably devoid of character after some early sizzle ; the result ( after a few seconds ) is utterly devoid of carbonation and lace , a mildly murky dullness that wo n't impress even the most forgiving 'beer geek ' . a few floating bits , suspended like 'sea monkeys ' , but no lace or head at all .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : crystal clear golden amber . solid three finger off white head . good retention . thick sticky lace clings to the glass .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : probably the coolest label art ever . opens with a soft hiss . pours a dead black color with very little head . ( my only gripe with this beer . )	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : standard pour yields a barely-there cluster of large , dark mocha colored bubbles that dissipates quickly . a thin ring of chocolate colored foam serves as the only real head . beer is opaque and pitch black . lacing is non existant but the legs make my glass a dark tan color . lack of carbonation really hurts but the legs and color are nice .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : deep orange with a slightly brown-orange head . lots of co2 showing up in this one .	0000000000000000000
1	appearance : chocolate velvet with assertive lacing . pitch black . dark brown head like the bottom of a cup of turkish coffee . the bubbles are just plain fun to watch disperse after the pour . like a herd of wildebeests crossing the nile during gator mating season , these little black-brown bubbles scatter from the head back into the brew from which they came .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : a semi vigorous pour produces 3 fingers of creamy/frothy light-brown head with lasting retention . the body is med-dark mahogany brown and magnifyingly clear . bb shot sheets of lace around the glass . good looking brew . s &	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : an obfuscated shade of titian ( obfuscated and titian being my secret words for today ) , with strange little chunks that came in two craptacular colors , cheese curd white and corky brown . thank goodness there were n't too many . the shallow cake of yeast made a half-moon in my glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : extremely hazy orangish-yellow with a fluffy white head . it really is an attractive looking beer .	0000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear golden yellow color with a white one-finger head . there 's an abnormal amount of carbonation flowing up toward the surface .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : brilliant straw , with great clarity . a soapy head of huge bubbles comes and goes in a flash . active carbonation bubbles are the biggest i 've seen this side of a bottle of soda . leaves no lace .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : what a lovely pour ! i think i agree with some others - this seems a bit too powerful to be called `` pale '' . a rich , rich golden colored ale , very slightly cloudy . the head was high and mighty , a nice contrasting eggshell color . lasted a fair amount of time considering the highish abv .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this beer looks incredibly promising when it is poured . it is a hazy golden orange color with a little more than 3 fingers of white head . lacing looks great when it reduces ; clumpy , fluffy , open and abundant that clings all over the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : dark amber color with a tannish/offwhite head . the head was abundant , exploding into the glass and settled to about 1/2 finger thickness , never getting smaller .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear , medium golden color with one finger of white foam head . heavy lacing remains on the glass .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : i love the way a kriek looks , dark red in color with a bit of pink in the half inch of head . kinda girlish , but i still like it	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured bright orange with a filmy head and an unusual amount of sediment . odd brightness which almost came through like grapefruit juice . n : hops , lots o hops . ample and sweet fruity hops . some fuminess and more than just the bitterness as it warmed .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : black coloring , like a cup of coffee ( duh ) . tan-colored head .	00000000000000000
0	a : out of the bottle and into my pint glass , it has an orange hue that is probably better described as amber . very thin head disappears almost instantly and leaves neither lacing nor a crest behind . the brew is very translucent , and you can spot a tad bit of bubbling within .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : with respect to the head , there is n't much ; formation ( ~0.5 fingers ) , retention , and lacing are minimal . the beer itself is colored a very dark brown with a hint of red .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours clean and golden with copious amounts of thick , white head . excellent retention , leaves tons of lace . did n't know pilsners looked this good .	0000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : nitro can did it & # 8217 ; s job well , big frothy head which settled into 3 very distinct layers . the base was jet-black beer ; middle layer was darker , cascading foam , topped by a creamy mocha head . it all settled down into a good finger and a half of taupe creamy head that went the distance and laced wonderfully . this is eye candy from start to finish . flavor : the initial taste is entirely neutral . no real flavor at all , just mouthfeel ( see below ) . this beer is all about aftertaste . at the swallow , the beer starts a drying evaporation that leaves a complex taste . it seems to have a malt base because of a fine , table sugar mist that accompanies the drying . deeper in , a taste of smoked bread ( is there such a thing ? ) the hops come into play very late in the profile with a burnt coffee bitter that is very refreshing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured into these massive snifters that seemed like they could hold the full 750ml somehow ( probably an exaggeration ) ... dark mahogan body , huge chocolate beige foam head and great retention	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a very pale yellow , with a light cap of fizzy white foam , spotty lace .	00000000000000000000
1	appearance : dark brown , with an active , overly zealous slightly off white head . do n't pour this baby too fast , or it 'll over flow the glass . carbonation is steady and rushing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours and opaque , light mahogany with no head , whatsoever . i 'm not sure if this was a result of a piss-poor pull or the chemistry of the beer . i did try to swirl things up and with the same results ...	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : 22 oz bottle dipped in crimson-colored wax , which is ridiculously thick . awesome label and presentation . the beer itself pours a dark but clear reddish-brown with two fingers of off-white head forming from a vigorous pour . the beer is just barely transparent in my tulip glass . head retention is decent for the style .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours a medium brown like a murky cider with a huge white head . lots of sediment floating in my glass . head stays forever with lacing all the way up my glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : what a gorgeous pour ! in my duvel tulip , this sits a mostly clear light amber with a gorgeous 3-finger thick off-white head . retention is excellent , and the lacing , beautiful . could not possibly want more from a beer 5/5	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : no head retention , dark amber colour , not really pale looking at all	0000000000000000
0	a : transparent . head lasts for days , lots and lots of bubbles . lots . and lots .	00000000000000000000
0	a : very dark , bit surprising for a wee heavy . bout a half inch of white head with good lacing on the glass .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : solid black body ( surprise ! ) topped by a majestic light brown head that shows truly noteworthy retention and leaves tons of sticky brown lace - this is exactly what i want an imperial stout to look like : exactly .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : medium gold body , almost no head on the pour . very little carbonation visible .	000000000000000000
1	appearance : an aggressive pour yields a huge 2 inch head that is brown is color with varying sized bubbles . the beer is opaque black , where no light can escape it . the head is pillowy and unrelenting , leaving plenty of lace against the crystal .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : this has almost no head from light carbonation and a bright copper color with transparent edges .	0000000000000000000
1	a : what a beautiful pour , copper in color with tons of frothy head that eventually subsides to a thick , creamy layer that leaves tons of lacing around the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : beautiful dark brown liquid , a finger of light tan head which dissipates quickly	0000000000000000
0	a : pours a dark mahogany with sightly less than one finger of head which quickly dissipates .	000000000000000000
0	appearance : think raspberry ice tea out of a drink fountain at mcdonald 's .	000000000000000
0	appearance : a one finger head that is ivory , creamy , and frothy , with poor retention . the color of the beer is a medium amber color with orange hues . the clarity of the beer is clear with some haziness . the head did leave a little lacing on the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a not timid pour resulted in a substantial , very light brown head that sticks around for a good while . lots and lots of lacing . the beer is surprisingly translucent when held up to the light .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : dark amber , head on the smaller side . good head rention and lacing that clings to the glass . lots of bubbles .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : a medium to dark brown with a thick bubbly tan head that dissapates rather quickly leaving almost no lace . nice color but with the lacking head and no lacing it 's not that impressive . belgians typically look great in the glass , this one does n't .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a light , gold/straw color with a small fizzy head that is gone rather quickly . no real lacing either .	000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : golden blonde , with effervescent white head .	0000000000
0	appearance : peach-colored	000
1	a : looks like a nice brown ale - dark brown , lighter highlights , tan head of a good size .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : very thin , tan watery head . half a finger width and zero retention rate . deep chocolate dark , moderate lacing . weird little floating bits ?	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : huge white head arrives and remains atop a glowing yellow-orange beer . extremely clouded with yeasts , can not see a thing through it . like the color a little more on the orange side , but this is close enough to perfect .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a nice rich amber/copper with some ruby highlights and an absolutely massive , mountainous beige head that just simply will not give up . took me at least 5 minutes just to be able to fill my glass 3/4 of the way , and i was being perfectly gentle ( yet undecided if that 's a good or bad thing . ) crazy lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : thick and hazy , but with not much head at all . both mine & my friend 's glass had no lacing and virtually no head . disappointing for a wheat beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : red poppy pours a murky dark ruby color with lighter ruby highlights . about 1.5 fingers of tan head forms . lacing and retention are decent . this is definitely not a beautiful beer , but not bad either .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : if its filtered i just do n't think it should be a wheat beer . i know technically its the same , but i guess i should be happy they do n't name it a hefe . golden yellow in color , low carbonation , but the head is 4 fingers wide on first pour . dissipates quickly though to allow you to fill the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured according to the directions and wound up with a massive head . toward the end of the pouring , the beer did n't even make it beyond the head- it hit the foam and just created more . beautiful dark golden color , the head dissipates slowly , and leaves lacing all down the glass . beautiful .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : clear blond color. , no head at all	0000000000
1	a : golden orange , clear , huge 3 finger foamy white head that looks like pillows of clouds bursting out of the glass . great head retention and lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : first off , this beer is highly over-carbonated . it 's so fizzy that a small 4oz pour creates enough head to fill-up a 20oz glass . the foamy head is very light , meringue-like and takes forever to settle . the beer itself is a cloudy/hazy copper-amber with brown hues . obviously a bottle-conditioned ale , and potentially an off one .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pors a very dark orange in color . kinda freakin me out a bit . this looks damn near brown , and glowing orange brown tends to scream barleywine to me . . . not wheatwine . held to the light , a little bit of golden yellow peeks through , but barely . a pretty agressive pour gets me just a minimal amount of white head , but that stuff is gone as quickly as it showed up . no real lace going on here . the only thing good about the appearance is the color , but that is a bit off as well . hmmm .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : 3/4 of the bomber was moderately poured into the tulip , leaving a full 3 fingers of fluffy bubbly white head . this is probably the nicest looking head i 've ever seen in this glass besides the beer it was intended for . body color is dark orange . absolutely fantastic lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a cloudy , hazy yellow-bodied beer . head is nonexistant to begin with , so retention is necessarily pour , as is the lacing . almost has an oily sheen on top - a little strange . having no real benchmark for the style , i 'm gon na have to give it a 2.5 .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a murky dark brown , low carbonation , very minimal head retention .	0000000000000000
0	appearance : a twist off cap whispers as i crack it . the beer pours a brown color with red highlights . a 1/2 '' light yellow/ivory head surfaces and shows a little bit of retention . not much lace left behind .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : creamy , salmon-froze pink and ultra-sugary : just aseptically-rightfulness hitherto in the like of fashion of how i maintained my beers : some bubbles , cloudy skinning/body-mold , watery alcoholic smells ... but granted to waiting a few 15-20 seconds of elapsed visualization , the froths sets in and it has this straightaway white-laced head , good for the show , and even better for presentation . there were a lot of bubbling going about from bottom to top , giving the old `` yeast metabolic transfer '' ... lovely ... ever-so very shiftily pleasant ... nice ... big ... sings a different song ... and how ! thank the lord and all up above i poured this one determinedly cooled pup into my patriots nfl pint ; it really kicked the moment ; i 've been using my ( much larger ) coka-cola rimmer for most of my overpopulated reviews . this is a fresh of breath air . and how ! -goddamn- .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : it has a unique look . it pours a burnt-orange color that glows like the fluid in a lava lamp . thin head that looks like the foam on a glass of iced tea .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : deep black , thin head , no head .	00000000000
0	appearance : golden in color with a hint of red , not the orangey/amber hue i look for in a good pumpkin . no head to speak of .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : it poured a dark thick black with a dark rich chocolate head that was massive , sticky and lingering . as the head slowly fell it left a bold lacing around the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this thing is beautiful , everything i would imagine from an imperial stout . pitch black , foamy dark brown head turns into a fizzy thin ring . nice lacing going on here . very nice appearance .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a full 3 finger head evaporates before my eyes with such haste that i check to see where the nearest exit is located . glass is crystal clear faint yellow . flavor : cream soda with a flash of plastic lime juice with a finish that goes completely stale and reminds me of dirty gym socks .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : bright , clear golden color topped by a perfectly white head of big bubbles . a lot of visible carbonation supporting the head . lacing just sticks to the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the beer is very dark brown in color and poured with a finger high light mocha colored head that has excellent retention properties and consistently left a thin head covering the surface .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : straw-golden yellow with some head ( white ) .	00000000000
0	a : an aggressive pour yields a fine , tan head that settles relatively quickly into a collar with a few islands of bubbles remaining . the body is hazy -- i like the yeast -- but pretty clearly a deep , dark red-brown , rather than the expected pitch black . pretty , but more in line with a dubbel or quad .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : almost no head . bright yellow body .	0000000000
1	a : maybe the best looking beer i 've ever seen . poured the blackest black . no light had even the slightest chance at this one . the slightest head , maybe 1/4 finger , and went away instantly . head never came back , even with an aggressive swirl . no lacing ( but with no head what can you expect ? ) . huge alcohol legs . just a beautiful beer !	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pale gold in color , nice head retention and lacing .	0000000000000
1	appearance : its body is black as night and opaque with a typical nitro head on top . the head is a creamy light tan color , very thick and very creamy . it has very good retention and makes cool lacing on the glass as i drink .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : i gave this a hard pour into a nonic pint glass which resulted in a solid one finger tan head that lasted for only a moment or so . the beer poured a very dark brown and maintained the slightest lacing throughout .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : cloudy light orange that resembles a hefeweizen , only without the billowing head . looks completely flat with no lacing . cloudy apple juice maybe ?	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a ruddy orangish gold with a massive frothy head . you 'll want to pour this one slowly so the entire glass is n't foam . carbonation is not an issue with this one .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : caramel color with large head that disappears quickly .	00000000000
0	a : solid black with no head .	00000000
0	a : pours a clear , pale gold color with a fizzy , one-finger white head . the head quickly recedes to a small ring around the glass , which does not lace very well .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : brilliantly crystal clear brownish maple leave colored beautifully carbonated glass of excitement with a good 1 finger head that decays slowly leaving potmarks that would rival my street in spring . i stared through the clear glass for a minute watching the red sox in an interesting brown tinge . just looking at this gives me the autumn feel with the dark brown maple leaf color , clear cold chill , ceamy head , and windy bubbles ( ok that might be stretching it , but you get the point ) . n : very much like oktoberfest marzen with lots of dark caramel and munich malts , some toastiness , and some lager like crisp aromas with touch of yeast . this nose also brings me back to october , even though its mid september .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured from the 12oz bottle into a tall pokal glass . the beer is a bright orangey color with a hint of gold , and no head to speak of .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a ruby red with a good 2 fingers worth of head . head settles to a nice ring and layer.. great lacing from start to finish .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : coppery amber with an enormous puff of foamy head that lasted until the liquid was gone from the glass . very , very impressive .	000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a deep black into a shaker pint glass with no light getting through . a hearty one-and-a-half-finger tan head forms on top and does n't really budge and only eventually drops to a splotchy yet full surface covering of foam . honestly , there is n't anything about how this beer looks that is n't perfect .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : ruby red with a small head that quickly fades to nothing .	00000000000000
1	appearance : it is an attractive beer . this beer settles into a dark cherry wood brown that retains its head nicely .	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : dark roasty brown with a thin head that dissipates fairly quickly . no visible carbonation .	000000000000000000
1	appearance : cloudy , peach-like color ( almost looks fuzzy from the haze ) . i 'll say that this is kinda interesting , but it is this beer 's only good aspect . small head development recedes to a ring .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : tiny to medium sized bubbles pack a one finger high khaki/tan head . carbonation bubbles quickly rise to the surface . it pours a deep , dark amber , almost black . i can not see my hand behind the glass . slight lacing traces its way down the glass as it is consumed .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : clear brown body , with no head at all upon serving . minimal to no lacing present .	00000000000000000000
1	appearance : solid black with thick lingering head . one of the better looking beers from a pint glass .	00000000000000000000

0	a : wow . this has the palest yellow color that is almost clear water . it is ridiculous . the beer has a pretty lame look . had about a finger of head that went away immediately . wow , shitty .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the beer is crystal clear golden yellow in color and has a high amount of visible carbonation . it poured with a two finger high white head that slowly died down and has excellent retention properties ; a thin head consistently covered the surface .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a nice golden amber pour that settles into a foggy amber body . the head reduces to a blotchy film that cover the surface but hugs the edges of the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : hazy with a light amber/orange body and thick , creamy white head . there 's loads of carbonation and it stacks majestically on top of the beer .	000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : pours a very pale straw color with hints of gold in it . has a slim one-finger head that dies down very quickly and actually manages to leave some lacing on the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : moderate pour down the center of the glass leads to 5 finger head ! wow this head is not going anywhere , sticks around forever . lots of carbonation in this one . beer is a golden color and somewhat hazy . looks like it could be unfiltered . 4.5	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : pale cloudy orange with a thin head .	0000000000
0	appearance : appropriately cloudy appearance . dark straw in color , actually a couple of shades darker than i expected . nice pure white head with staying power . heavy population of tiny carbonation bubbles . i subtracted half a point for the fact that some of the yeast from the bottom of the bottle poured out in heavy chunks . while i understand what the heffe in heffeweisse means , i found this visually unappealing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : very clear copper tone with a slight reddish hue . flavor : very unique . apricot , i guess , if i did n't read the bottle i would have never guest . really sweet up front that follows through the entire swallow . fruity , and finishes with a spicy , peppery hop bitterness that is over powered by the candy like sweetness .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : one finger head of decent cream . pathetic 30 second retention . i 'm excited to try a new irish brewery beer . amber-copper colour . transparent . sm : fresh caramel and nutty hops . butterscotch hints ? medium strength scent . maybe a bit of vanilla as well . hard to determine with me broken nose .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : i loved the appearance of this beer it had a yellow murky tint . very eye pleasing .	00000000000000000000
1	a : pours pitch black with a huge head - seriously like 4 '' of light mocha foam that has huge staying power and prevents me from pouring the entire beer at once . while this is the first time i 've had this from a bottle ( had it once on tap before ) so i ca n't say if this level of head is normal , but it is absolutely the most gorgeous head i 've ever seen . needless to say , the lacing on this is out of this world .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a 4 finger , thinner looking , fluffy white head with great retention . color is amber or chrome yellow with medium carbonation . the head turns very thin and bubbly over time , leaving thin splotchy bubbles down the glass . what the hell ? no head remains , and ends looking flat . bleh .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : is n't this what a hef is supposed to look like ? murky , cloudy , ca n't see through the glass , picturesque . three fingers of very soft lingering foam with everlasting lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dunno . : )	000000
1	appearance : a solid amber color that proved to be very transparent . a head that would n't quite , awsome retention , absolutly enormous , light tan in color . leaving rings of sticky lace all the way down .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a hazy amber glass with no head . flavor : this is different . a slightly licorice and whiskey note fades into a light mango finish . there is a gentle metallic edge at the end as well . hops are pretty low for an apa .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the beer pours a very nice golden brown from a 12 oz bottle with a 1.5-2 finger head after a slightly vigorous pour . the head disappates fairly quickly , but leaves some lacing along the side of the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : no head now but thats probably because it gushed all over the place for five minutes before i poured it . amber/red color .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : has a pitch-black body with a beautiful , dark mocha-colored head . the light has no chance against the body of this beer . the head has excellent retention for 10 % ( seriously , it 's confusing ) and fantastic lacing that just wo n't go away .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : this has a medium brown color with a raspberry tint . slightly transparent edges . no head , this is pretty flat , just a few stray bubbles .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a piss golden yellow color , little head and crystal clear . bright vibrant yellow piss color .	000000000000000000000
0	a : witte noire pours with a 1 and a half finger , medium brown creamy head that is fairly fast to diminish . lasting film . the body is a very dark shade of amber-brown with transparency only along the edges . lightly particulate . good lacing initially , but stickiness is lacking , resulting in a glass scantily clad with erratic strings of lace .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : moon glow is extremely hazy , with a brown-orange body and white head . lacing and retention are both on the low side , but do n't forget that this brew is nearly 9 % abv . the main points here are lost to the clumps of yeast that sit limply at the bottom of my tulip . i do n't mind suspended yeast , but clumps are a touch off putting .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a slightly overly vigorous pour resulted in two inches of rocky white foam on top of a bright golden , slightly clouded liquid . it took a while , but eventually things settled down into a persistent half-inch cap of foam that left thick lacing throughout the session . each top-off from the bottle and each swirl of the tuilp reinvigorated the solid head . gorgeous tripel .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pale yellow with a slightly white haze ; pours with a rediculous amount of fluffy white head ; continous degassing makes a great bubble show ; plenty of retention & leaves a foamy lace .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured into a pint glass a dark brown . my pour produces a rather thin 1/4 inch light brown head . as i look at the beer i do a double take . i pick up my glass for a closer examination . what the hell ? there are some tiny whitish floaty things in my beer ! i keep my glassware clean , handwashing them , i know there was nothing in there when i poured my beer . there was something in the beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : poured a very deep brown , nearly black color . almost a one finger head that quickly faded from the middle out .	0000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a hazy pale golden , with a fizzy white head that thins to a persistent ring .	00000000000000000000
1	a : this beer pours a beautiful , clear , copper color with a one finger of offwhite creamy head that holds nicely . minor lacing is left on the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : murky purple body with a pink head , well carbonated . think bavik wit with raspberry juice added .	000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a murky orange with a full white head , excellent head retention and lacing .	000000000000000000
0	a : the color of this is quite shocking . i expected a pinkish hue , but instead this looks like hazy chardonay . three fingers of white , fizzy soda-pop head that falls super fast and leaves no lacing . like usual , upland managed to make an ugly brew . 5.0	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : solidly black body with an inch of creamy tan head . good retention and strong lacing . very nice .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : dark amber with a good size , strong head . this was the best part about this brew .	000000000000000000000
0	a : slightly better than a macro brew . sub par head and lacing .	000000000000000
0	appearance : served on tap it had a golden color with orange hues and a fizzy white head on it . the retention was very poor . the head barely lasted from the tap to getting the glass in front of me .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a light , clear amber body with no head to note and no lacing either . nothing overly impressive .	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a nice pillowed white head formed when poured . the head receded slowly to a nice clumpy layer . lacing was way above average and the color was pale yellow . barely cloudy with lots of carbonation .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pale and light-bodied . a considerable white head emerged from the tap .	000000000000000
1	a : midnight black with a super thick mocha colored head that stands 2 inches tall . it slowly fades but never really disappears . perfect !	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : nice red color , very cloudy , wonderful reddish white head , decent lacing and retention . 1-finger .	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : it was only fitting to pour this imperial stout into a `` maudite '' snifter . what came of the bottle was a thick black oily sludge of a beer . i use the term `` oily sludge '' in a good way though . i could have used the term `` oil , '' but that 's not a good enough description of this beer 's color . sitting on top of this oily sludge was a 1/2 to 3/4 of inch head of mocha colored foam . this mocha colored head of foam had decent retention that left behind foamy mocha rings along the edge and a few spots of mocha lace around the snifter . the color of this beer is just as nice as the label itself .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a beautiful orangy hazy yellow sunsetty color with a huge 3 finger foamy , honey comb like head . lots and lots of lacing down the glass , huge head retention . one of the best in this style .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours into my hennepin chalice a crystal clear pale gold color with a huge , loose-bubbled , white head . the becomes very rocky as it drops leaving tons of lacing down the side of the glass . this looks perfect .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this is a beauty . opaque bottle-conditioned dark orange brownish color . two fingers of thick , off-white creamy/frothy hybrid head . pretty good retention and a lot of lacing . 4.0	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : looks like motor oil . it pours a thick , oily , viscous pitch black . as you pour , it looks and even sounds very syrupy . the dark brown head dissipated quickly . was only about a 1/2 finger at the max .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured amber colored with a finger head and a little lacing .	00000000000000
1	appearance : beautiful brew . hazy orange-tan body with a fluffy white head . very airy head leads to an interesting lacing pattern on the glass .	000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : head never amounted to much , and was gone surprisingly fast . carbonation is very high in this beer .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : really nice looking porter . black bodied beer with a huge head over 3 fingers high leaving lacing all over the glass . the head medium brown in color .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a completely opaque black body , with a 3/8 '' light brown head that quickly drops to just a thin ring around the edge of the glass . a thin string or two of lacing is formed at every sip and hang around for a while .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a motor oil pour yielded a towering near 3 finger mocha colored head that stood the test of time and patience . smooth , yet firm with the texture of wet sand , it remained unscathed on the surface as it receded at glacier speed . an absolute beautiful presentation in a snifter that words truly fail and fall short in description . spongey patches of lacing leave a nice calling card .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured into a snifter a rich and deep dark brown but a very thin , tan head . nothing spectacular .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : into a pint glass , massive head immediately develops -- i had to slow down just to keep it in the glass . 1/2 cap has great retention and produces massive lacing . beautiful golden sparkly color is exactly what i look for in a summer beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a light copper amber with good visibility . 1 1/2 finger white head forms and holds nicely ( hops ! ) . nice sticky lacing throughout .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a hazy reddish/orange color . a tiny bubbly white head forms , and is gone in an instant . not much lace either .	000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : beautiful yellow sunset over the western skies - 5	00000000000
0	a : golden orange hue with no head or lacing ... almost like apple cider in its look , not great .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a dark golden yellow color with a reddish orange hue . there is a 2 finger head that is ivory and foamy . there is a lot of effervescence in the beer . the clarity of the beer is hazy , duh that is what the label said . there is a lot of lacing on the mug .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured into a pint glass from a 12oz bottle . thick fluffy head that slowly receded into a ring around the glass and left some decent lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a clear honey colour , like oak aged whiskey . the colour made me suspect they got the label wrong , and put it on a honey lager or some other style . it poured with a one finger of head that settled quickly . lacing was moderate .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark gold .	00000
0	a : pours a clear , but very dark , reddish brown body . half a finger of light beige head . short retention , with a thin collar and some bubbles on top .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured a brown amber , slightly cloudy , with some suspension . one finger bubbly that diminishes immediately . no visible carbonation . no lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : one of the prettiest beers i have ever seen . arrives in a root beer mug with a coffee brown body and a frothy tan head that would outdo anything starbuck 's puts on top of its lattes ; plenty of lacing all the way downt the side of the glass	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : unimpressive pale yellow . about as pale as they come . not much foam and no lacing .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : a light and transparent brown pour produces a small , thin , bubbly , crackly tan head that vanishes instantly . flat looking . black body , transparent for the style , and zero carbonation evident . looks flat to the finish . lifeless and thin looking .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : looks like dirty water .	0000000
0	appearance : from the can , it looks like yellow carbonated water .	0000000000000
1	appearance : exceedingly pale lemony-yellow , hazy body under a generous white head that leaves gorgeous clumpy lacing . a rather pretty presentation .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : not terribly impressive to look at , at least not compared with many of the other ipas i 've seen/drank of late . pale , golden yellowish in color , very little head , though nice lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : slightly hazy golden hue like it should be . really nice head with crazy lacing and good retention . it does n't come of my glass even when i wipe it with my finger .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : golden amber color . a strange opaqueness from a light colored but heavy microscopic sediment floating throughout the beer . pours a decent head initially with soapy bubbles that disappear quickly .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : an attractive , hazy orange . not overly hazy , but not completely clear either . big bubbled head dies way too quickly . literally no retention and it 's not the glass . otherwise bubbles come rocketing to the surface .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : ruddy brown , very scotch ale like . no head at all , even with a vigourous pour .	000000000000000000000
0	appearance : amber/copper , hazy . bottles have some sediment on the bottom , but tap is relatively free of this . very little foam .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : black , 2 finger brown head that dissipates quickly to nothing , no lacing .	00000000000000000
1	a : poured a burgundy with ruby highlights and a pink head that had a little lacing .	000000000000000000
0	a : pours a murky orange that reminds me of watered down apple cider . sticky white head and lacing that seem to hang on for a while .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours brown and makes a small , light brown , medium looking head that quickly fades to a wisp and ring . sits a very dark brown in the glass with minimal carbonation evident . relatively clear for the style perhaps . a ring remains until the end but leaves no lacing on the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : used to ipas that are darker and redder in color , so i was surprised at how orange and golden it was . also , the head was thin with very little sustain , which as also a disappointment	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured from a 12 oz . bottle into a 12. oz . glass . it looks good , makes me want to drink it . smells : smells pretty good , like the snack bar at a baseball stadium .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : way over carbonated it took several pours to get the beer into the pint , but other wise it pours a hazy golden with a huge amount of head.1.5	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : amber copper , not much head , just a tiny bit of ring , and some fish food sediment .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a light amber with a real mild white head , fair retention , no lace .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : now this is depressing me already , but i will try not to continue with any preconceived notions . the beer pours a somewhat cloudy brown color that was practically lifeless . there were a few islands of tannish foam when i was pouring the daylights out of it ... at least for a dubbel . i poured the whole bomber in about 15-20 seconds . i ca n't really see any bubbles rising , and when held to the light . there is n't any more lace than you get from a coke .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy amber color that was much lighter than i was expecting . a fizzy eggshell head formed quickly , but sadly would n't stick around . left no lace .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : beautiful thick rich frothy head atop a crystal clear golden brew	0000000000000
0	appearance : pours a light orange/yellow color with an off-white , fluffy head which fades quickly .	00000000000000000
1	a : black-brown-redish color with a one finger tan head that fades to almost nothing . light lace is left as the foam recedes	000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours the clearest yellow i 've ever seen . plenty of carbonation with a large white head , which does not last long .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : one of the most beautiful beers i have ever seen . it pours a murky creamy brown color . the head is monstrous . it is sooo large and fluffy kind of like whipped cream in appearance . it 's like a large feather pillow as it comes to rest above the rim of my affligem chalice and leaves behind thick lacing . this baby reminds me of a root beer float . the head absolutely refuses to die . magnificent .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : cloudy orange color ; abundant head , good carbonation ; lacing nice	00000000000000
0	a : pale color , a little cloudy , white head dissapates far to quickly into almost nothing , not happy about that	00000000000000000000000
0	a : looks brown to black , but if held to the light is a translucent dark amber . i was surprised that , being a stout , it was so light . has a caramel-colored head that is somewhat thin for a stout and dissipates rather quickly , but a remnant stays throughout drinking .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : best part of the beer . nice amber pour . tiny bubbles linger .	0000000000000000
0	a : pour is a bit darker than usuall for this style , hazy deep golden . the white head is smaller than others in thes style , airy and light . dissipates quickly into faint lacings .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : state pen porter pours deep , dark brown with a creamy , one-finger , beige head . the cap contains big bubbles interspersed in a thick cream .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a translucent orange-rust with a 1-finger eggshell head . leaves a fair light lacing on the glass . fairly average in appearance .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a muddy dark brown . brownish/whitish head is pleasant at first but quickly dies to virtually nothing . no lacing either .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : mahogany/dark amber in color with a slights haze . thick , two finger white head that sticks and barely settles at all . probably the best pumpkin ale i have ever seen .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : light amber with an off orange ( pumpkin ) hue . nice fluffy head with some decent staying power , falling to about 1/4 inch . bubbles lazily float to the surface through a slightly viscious liquid .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : black with a big beige head . scattered lacing .	000000000000
1	a : yellowish brown ale ; very prominent head and excellent lacing	000000000000
0	a : pours a pale gold and is topped my a miniscule head that vanishes , and leaves only a ring around the glass to ever indicate it was there ; no lacing to speak of . the appearance is lackluster , however , it has its redeeming aspects .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark amber , clear , fluffy , foamy 2-inch head . small but thick patches of lacing .	00000000000000000000
1	a : nearly clear medium yellow color . like the dfh version , this one gives a hell of a lot of head . fortunately , it looks great with super dense white froth . unfortunately , it takes forever to subside and getting a full glass took a while . still pretty though . 3.5	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy orange body under a thin , frothy cap of tan foam . mediocre retention , spotty lace . decent .	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : copper/orange body , foamy white head , fades fast , but a little lingers quite a while .	00000000000000000000
0	a : very macro style lager looking with a decent head formed by the active carbonation	0000000000000000
0	a : pours an orange-amber body with a small , white head with pretty poor retention and minimal lacing that was not too impressive for me for the style .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pale golden yellow with a wispy white top .	00000000000
1	a : slightly reddish copper color ; huge head ; great carb action ; good lacing	0000000000000000
0	a : clear , golden with a stiff white head	0000000000
1	a : pours a dark , nearly impenetrable black body with a perfect finger 's worth of light tan head . it 's exquisite , in the way that all nitro-tap dark beers are : watching the suds coalesce into a dark body as they cascade up the beer is nothing short of eye-pleasing . tons of thick lacing down the glass as i drink . it 's beautiful , and i ca n't fault anything here .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a cloudy amber-orange color , with lots of suspended floaties all throughout the beer . at least a full finger of frothy off-white head and decent lacing ; this beer gets marked down due to the floaties since for all i know , it could be a brand new bottle ( dear green flash , please date your bottles ) .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : when poured into a pilsner glass , this flavored dark beer is a dark mahagony brown with a massive 4 inch creamy head of tan foam . it seemed like forever for the head of foam to recede to a point where i could drink the sweet liquid behind it . when it did recede , it left behind a tan colored film and tons of tan colored lace in its tracks .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours hazy pale gold with a head that disappears by the time i 'm typing this description . can not determine effervescence . poor appearance is understandable but unacceptable .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark maroon red , with a thick rich cap of white foam , great head retention , extensive thick lacing .	0000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a slightly hazy deep gold with a thin , wispy head .	000000000000000
0	a : horrifying protein , or blueberry , or yeasy or whatever haze . would make a new beer drinker think it was unsafe .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : a little cloudy with a slight white head . the head dissipates quickly and leaves no trace on the glass .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : black with a nice persistent dark tan head and lacing .	0000000000000
0	appearance : one of the less attractive shades of orange ... though you could argue it 's halloweeny . tiny ring of foam at the top , with some nice carbonation streaming through the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a hazy orange color with a big 3 '' merangue-like head that lasts for quite a while . some spotty lacing develops during the session .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a murky yellow-orange with two fingers of white head that recedes into a thin ring with no lacing .	0000000000000000000000
0	appearance : medium rich gold hue w/bright clarity ( i do n't really appreciate that in this style ) and attractive beading carbonation in an etched belgian chalice ... the white head is fairly meagre , however , even after a strong pour , and soon fades to a thin , flimsy , and rapidly-fading film .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a mostly clear reddish amber color with a persistent creamy tan head that is about 1/4 '' it is leaving some pretty thick lacing on the class as you swirl it a bit . there are quite a few bubbles rising to maintain the head , and it is still very active quite a few minutes after the pour .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours a translucent , pale brownish-gold color . has a large , frothy head that dissipates slowly and leaves some nice lacing .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : a strange light yellow . almost like a sparkling wine . lots of carbonation , decent head with tight bubble structure , but no lacing in the glass really .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : as expected this beer pours ink black and easily forms a rich nut brown head with good retention . some foam lacing clings to the side of the glass as you drink it down , and the alcohol seems to provide some legs to the beer as well . flavor : hard hitting dark chocolate smacks the mouth right away . the chocolate comes off as nearly burnt as roasted character blends into deep chocolate sweetness . alcohol spice enters the labyrinth of flavors as dark fruits find their way through to your tongue . hop bitterness bites the back and top of your mouth before the beer finishes off with yet more roasted bitterness .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hmmm ... i 'm a little confused . this beer looks very similar to boulevard 's wheat . a hazy golden color , that reminds me of wheat .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours and orangeish red , touch lighter than a marzen . head is very nice ... fluffy and barely off white .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : nice deep copper color , head is about 1/2 '' and fades off to a film . quite a good amount of lacing .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured into a pint glass : no real head to speak of , but a nice orange-amber hue , a bit lighter in color than i 'd expected .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours extremely clear yellow/straw color with a one finger white head that fades quickly . nice lacing .	00000000000000000000
0	a : looks very carbonated . not much goin on with the head ; pretty thin both in size and look ( not foamy its more just like large bubbles ) , no lacying . transparent-translucent orange colored beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : the yeti pours thick and black as motor oil . one of the darkest i have seen , not even a suggestion of light could get through this beer . the head is about an inch and i would n't call it tan . this head is coffee with cream brown , on par with the darkness below it . however , it fades quickly leaving very thick lace in some parts of the glass , but not all . as the glass drains , the lace loosens up a bit , but remains semi-spotty .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : crystal clear yellow brew , small head that dissipates quickly . no lacing .	0000000000000000
0	a : thomas hooker has a bad rep with me . poor carbonation in all of their swing tops . i have given them my last chance . this beer poured flat as hell like very other beer i have had from them .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : sightly hazy pale orange , with minimal head and poor lacing .	00000000000000
0	a : jet black , much like a black hole - light can not escape it 's grasp . tan head which dissipates leaving a ring of beige around the inside of the glass . not appealing but nonetheless acceptable for a stout .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : when poured in , there was very little head , which dissipated quickly too . there was no lacing . and the color was a clear amber color .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours an oily , viscous black color with about an eigth to quarter inch of tan head that dissapears very quickly leaving a think ring of lace around the edge of the glass , when held tote light no light ca be seen through it	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : arrives at the bar with a dark espresso colo and a thick , tan head that takes forever to settle down ; once it did , it was as beautiful as a guiness and left sheets of lace along the sides of the glass	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a pitch brown body , nearly black in the glass but revealing some translucence around the edge . the head is surprisingly billowy and fluffy for an imperial stout , but i expected that when the cork nearly took my head off . it 's a dark mocha color . it leaves wispy trails of bubbles on top of the brew , with a thin collar adorning the edge . looks like caramel swirled into milk chocolate . my second pour ( the next day ) was still carbonated with good retention .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a pale straw color with a nice finger and a half head . decent head retention .	00000000000000000000
1	a : looks a lot like espresso . deep brown with a decent 2 fingers of light brown head . goes away and leaves a nice white lace .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dark orange/copper with a finger of light tan head that quickly recedes into almost nothing with very little lacing .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear darkish yellow with a minimal head and some occasional lacing .	00000000000000
1	appearance : deep bright amber color , clear . lots of fine bubbles . head looks pretty creamy , white color . lacing looks nice on the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : there is no head whatsoever , and it seems nearly all the carbonation was expended during the pour . anyways , the body is a deep black , as expected by a porter . nothing special here .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : as light a yellow as i have ever seen .	000000000000
1	a : slightly cloudy pale yellow brew . pours medium white head with fair retention . good lacing .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : rich gold color , moderately hazy . surprisingly small head of foam for an unfiltered wheat beer . very little lacing left behind .	00000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : 12oz . bottle poured into imperial pint . thin head , very slight visible carbonation . colour is an amber red .	000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : as poured the beer is lightly hazed golden color with an orange undertone and a 2 head that is ivory in color and fluffy enough that it almost looks like whipped cream . the head recedes slowly leaving patches and legs of lacing clinging to the sides of the glass . at one point there is a small ring of foam around the glass and a whipped cream island covering part of the surface . though out the beer , sipping leaves foam and lacing on the sides of the glass , some of which slides back down to the liquid , some of which remains clinging to the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : rose in colour with pink hues . pours with a frothy pink head that dissipates quickly . slight haze .	0000000000000000000000
0	appearance : light on the carbonation , this provides only a thin lace on top of the tawny hued brew .	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours an almost opaque brown-black with slivers of reddish-brown light seeping around the edges . a finger of mocha colored head dissipates quickly leaving a ring around the glass interspersed with some larger bubbles .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured a radiant light orange with good carbonation and a nice white cap . this growler pour had a slightly different tint and cloudier appearance	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : cloudy and glows golden-red . moderate amount of visible carbonation . really yummy foamy head . this might be the best-looking beer i 've ever had .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : bright , clear golden yellow color . poured a 1 finger fizzy white head with some retention to a thin skim . decanted continually . no lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a hazed , dirty burned sepia , pretty much what i would imagine a good dunkelweizen should look like . then again , this one also showcases a thin , quickly fading head that leaves no collar and no surface dusting , and successive sips are n't that much more successful at imparting lace on the sides of the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours out a crystal clear golden yellow with a thin white head that immediately disappears . leaves no lace whatsoever . could easily be confused with cheap apple juice or other yellow liquid .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : decent . good creamy head with a few thick bubbles that is slow to go down , matching a somewhat cloudy orange/rust/amber body . lacing well .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a light pale orange color with yellow highlights on the glass edge . a weak 1/4 '' head has some big bubbles , and falls pretty quick .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : minimal light-pink head ; murky dull-magenta body	000000000
1	a : wonderful sunny body cloudy with some specks of yeast , great white head with good staying power and amazing lacing .	00000000000000000000000
0	appearance : golden , little to no head or retention and only a tiny bit of lacing . large bubbles .	000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours clear , dull amber color with a thin white head .	00000000000000
1	a : color is black trailing to a dark brown at the edge . pours with a 3/4 inch bright brown head that slowly dissipates to a thin brown film on top . nice lacing on the edge of the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this is quite a looker , especially once the head dies down . pitch black color . two fingers of thick creamy medium brown head with pretty good retention and a glass absolutely plastered with lacing . the last 1/8 of head lasts seemingly forever . 4.0	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : gently hazed champagne body with a soft , stiff , enormous , airy , white head with great retention .	0000000000000000000000
0	appearance : this is not a great looking beer . it is a murky brown and has zero head . i was actually able to count twelve bubbles on the surface .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : red glow , so clean , no haze , no maltyness	0000000000000
0	a : pours a nice orange/amber color with very modest head . no retention , but good lacing . clumpy yeast ( a lot of yeast , actually ) dominates , with no visible carbonation . clumps remain . weird looking . never had a bottle-conditioned beer with this much yeast or this much clumping .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a very pale straw yellow with virtually no head . does n't look all that good to me .	000000000000000000000
0	a : golden yellow colored body with some noticeable haze . a white sudsy , bubbly head is on top that leaves some minor lacing and a thin , fizzy retention cap . somewhat standard fair for the style but i 've definitely seen better looking tripels .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : i really wanted to like this beer more than i ended up doing , primarily because of all the floaties in it . it really detracted from the experience . beyond that , it pours a dark hazy amber with a big but not overwhelming head .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear amber coloring . very little head . absolutely no lacing .	00000000000000
0	a : not a major head of foam . darker off white head of foam , deep dark red to brown . doesnt build that classic stout head .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a crystal clear yellow gold with one full finger of head . they tiny bubbles take quite awhile to dissipate , leave some great lacing along the very top of my ithaca tulip glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a hard pour produces minimal brown head with next to no retention and almost zero lacing . a thick stout is clearly on the prowl here though with an opaque body .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours fairly light for an imperial stout , dark brown , some deep reddish highlights , white head , some lacing	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : burnished amber in color , bright and clear . an inch of off-white head retains nicely .	0000000000000000000
1	appearance : the beer pours out a very dark , almost brown , copper/amber with a 1 '' fluffy tan head that recedes slowly leaving behind rings of foam . sipping produces lots of streaked lacing and a couple of sheets of foam . even with most of the beer gone there is still lacing on the sides of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : clear light amber , very small head , and a little lacing .	000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a very dark brown with auburn highlights but only a wisp of a head that quickly fritters away	000000000000000000000
0	a : amber in color with little to no head . carbonation is low , which i prefer over too much . no lacing .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : pale straw in color with thin white head that quickly dissipates . this belies what is to come .	000000000000000000000
0	a : very pale yellow with quickly disappearing white head .	00000000000
1	a : dark opaque copper body with two fingers are creamy mocha head . head retains throughout the entire drink and leaves thick lacing . if i did n't know any better i would have thought this was on nitro .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear , golden , almost peach coloration . about one finger of initial head with great retention and good lacing . lots of visible carbonation .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : it already appears a bit cloudy where altbier is typically really clear and a copper-like color . there is very little head after a reserved pour . after swirling the beer , there is some lacing left on the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours an extremely dark ruby-brown with a billowing khaki colored head that took forever and a day to recede into a thick oily film that left epic sheets of lacing down the glass . great head retention .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a very clear chestnut/dark amber hue . head starts a bit minimal and the retention/lacing are pretty dismal . body looks good , but i like some fluff on top .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : virtually black with a considerably dark brown thin head with great lacing and stickiness . a great looking pour .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark brown , near black ale with insane head . three+ fingers of mocha head loosely packed falls in five minutes or so to leave a thick quilt of the same . near sheeting lace .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : faint yellow , with practically no head and no lacing at all .	000000000000000
1	a : pitch black , but i have no daylight to see through . nice thick , fluffy , 3+ finger light tan head that dies down but leaves just as thick lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : exceptional . very nice brilliant copper with a good foamy head . i was excited .	000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear ruby red/brown color . a two finger beige head forms . the wispy foam has good retention , and some lace is left behind .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : matte black body with dingy ruby highlights topped with a very persistent one finger extremely creamy buff head . the well-known reverse cascade effect is beautiful to behold .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear brown body , thin tan head . light lace . ok , but uninteresting .	000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark reddish/brown color . at first a two finger pink head forms and gently recedes . light lace .	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : very dark , think black oil look too it . seemed to pour thick and left about a 2 finger dark tan head to it . no light penetrated the glass when held to the light .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : slightly cloudy dark amber with lots of carbonation , with the head slow to dissipate . poured into a tulip .	00000000000000000000000

1	appearance : a thick , rich pour with head that 's slow to come out , but builds to 1.5 fingers high and is creamy tan . head recedes at a moderate pace leaving spotting . a somewhat cloudy deep deep brown .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy reddish-amber body with a finger of frothy off-white head that fairly quickly subsides into a ring and leaves minimal lacing . a little disappointing , but not terrible .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : the beer poured a very nice dark brown coloration . the head was thick and luxurious off white brown coloration . major head retention was evident in this beer . the lacing was thick webbing up and down the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pale , clear yellow . head settles at about half a finger . no visible carbonation . heavy lacing .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : 650ml bottle no bottling date . pours very dark , black . fine bubbles that dissipate quickly , with a head that is 1 and a half fingers .	0000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours a clear orange color with a 3 '' fluffy merangue-like head . carbonation bubbles clearly streaming upward .	000000000000000000000
1	a : a hazy gold color with a huge dense head that just sits on the beer and does n't move . the carbonation in this beer is incredible , it looks like the beer is alive .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours with a light brown head , that is small to begin with and quickly vanishes without a trace . for only 8 % abv , the head could have lasted a little longer and some lacing would have been nice . this brew rolls clean off of the glass . the body is an opaque black but thin ruby edges are visible when held to light . i 'm looking for something to justify a better appearance rating but there is really nothing exceptional regarding its look .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : very small head when poured into a tulip , rapidly dissipating . very nice copper color	000000000000000000
0	appearance : the body was cloudy gold with a small white head which had great retention and lacing .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : typical hefe appearance at first , foggy yellow with a fluffy head , but after just a few minutes the head disappeared ! , i 've never seen a hefe head disappear before .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a hazy golden/orange color . a small white head forms , and recedes in a second . light lace .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : very light , no head out of the bottle .	000000000000
1	a : this looks so great : dark brown/black , with a very large , pretty longlasting , brown head - the head is great ! ! ! some lace .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a hard pouring yields a fluffy cream coloured head that dissipates into a bubbly lace with interwoven rings of brussels lace . decent clarity with a mahogany reddish colour that is quite stunning .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a clear , ruby red body with a fizzy , off-white head .	0000000000000000
0	appearance : no head at the pour , so no lace . deep brown glass with good clarity . flavor : smoke , but not as intense as the aroma would lead me to believe . more of the sweet , fairly light malt flavor comes through , well balanced but no hops noted .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a really dark nice attractive color with about a quarter inch worth of tan head that dissapears fast leaving a little lacing ... very attractive beer	0000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : not much head , even less head retention , and next to no lacing . the crystal clear orange-brown body ( no yeast ) is interesting , but i 'm not quite sure what kind of belgian this is supposed to be .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a good 1 finger head is somewhat light and airy , but nice looking . i ca n't even begin to describe how clear this beer is , i could perfectly watch the red sox game through it without a problem , well maybe some light bending . anyways the amber and very light brown color is a nice toasty color . the head has divided to a nice light creamy good lookin head covering . n : yep , that 's toasted pumpkin . some semi sweet aromas with pumpkin and toasted notes basically fill out the entire nose . perhaps some light spices , but that 's all i have to say about that .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : deep amber with a soapy 2 finger head in a snifter . head subsides leaving nice lacing all around . islands of head float throughout the drink . awesome webbed lacing throughout .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : golden , very foamy head	0000000

1	a : akpa has an amber color when not held to light and a ruby-orange color when held to light . i find it to be a beautiful hue . a light khaki head sits at a finger and a half from a medium pour into a snifter . a full-covering film retains nicely , with scallion-like circles residing in it . sleek , stringy carbonation bubbles move at a mezzo pace up the glass . the lacing is so good - sticky with fine hieroglyphic patterns all over the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : even with a careful pour , the unsettled yeast sediments still manage to storm my glass , causing a horribly cloudy , even dirty , dark yellowish body with millions of cottony bits floating in there ... the white fluffy head settles slowly to a thin blanket on top of rather sporadic , mild carbonation .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : almost no head or retention . nice full brown color . smell is not hard to detect at all . surprisingly a lot of pale malts come through . little caramel malting is apparrent . chocolate malts are there but are overpowered by the pale malts . grainy overtones are apparaent as well . smells like some unfermented barley went into this brew .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : great thick globs of tan foamy head . deep black colored beer . probably the best head i 've ever seen . when i was done drinking it i spun the head around the glass and it filled up the whole glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : exceptional , should be the example of perfect lacing ! it pours a golden hue topped with a frothy white head that leaves you feeling the beer wants you to drink it .	00000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : light tan head , minimal lacing . dark amber body , cloudy . i enjoy the look ; i think it is a perfect pumpkin ale color .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : cowboy coffee pours a very dark brown -- close to stout-looking -- color with about a finger of khaki head . retention is really good , and lacing is good as well . i enjoy the hell out of rich , dark porters , and so far this one fits the bill very nicely . great looking beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pale gold , fairly quickly dissipating head leaving little lacing .	0000000000000
0	a : i was somewhat surprised when the bartender set the pint in front of me ... i had expected a `` classic '' belgium saison with its characteristic non-filtered blond appearance . what i saw looked more like an american amber . the clear , almost copper body was topped by a moderate off-white head that showed decent retention but left little lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear , almost glowing cherry wood , looks a bit like fresh brewed iced tea for those familar with the look of that beveredge . the beer is topped with a inch of foamy , bubbly , sandy brown head which could benefit from a bit more staying power .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : clear golden orange with some thin white head . lots of spotting .	000000000000000

1	a : perfectly clear with festive carbonation . frothy white head falls quickly , with no lace . golden more than yellow .	00000000000000000000000

0	a : a roasted orange color that is hazy . sediment is present ( bottle was poured gently to avoid disturbing sediment ) .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : ruddy red-orange with half a finger head that recedes quickly	000000000000

1	appearance : hazy gold glass holds a finger white head a long time leaving lace . flavor : mineral elements hit me first , followed by full , firm hops . classic ipa profile , crystal sweet malt supporting hoppy goodness . some yeast notes come through as well .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pale golden in color with a bit of an amber tinge - crystal clear at the pour . big initial soapy white head of about an inch , but quickly dissipates to a basic ring . some light lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : amber/brownish hue , passes some light , thick off white head , great lacing .	00000000000000000
1	appearance : gorgeous amber brown ale with tan bubbly head atop . clarity is slightly cloudy . head lasts and lasts but does n't pour so big as to dominate the glass . flawless appearance as allagash beers typically are . ( 5.0 )	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured a one fingered head while being a beautiful amber with carbonation rising . the carbonation is rising throughout the snifter equally which is rare for carbonation rising and some carbonation even sits at the base of the glass . this also laces beautifully down the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : well not a lot to complain about here . it laced incredibly well and produced a finger and a half of head . did n't quite retain as well as i would have liked it to though . the body is a bit of a dull yellow that is n't quite lager yellow . good start	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pale , straw yellow without much head .	0000000000

0	a : pours a nice amberish brown hue with little to no head .	00000000000000
1	a : dark dark black . no light can get through . dense fluffy espresso head . this head will not go away . it has been sitting 5 minutes and still is about an inch thick . awesome lacing too . so is that because of over carb or just good brewing ? lets dig deeper to find out .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : this is the only spot where im not overly pleased . a light golden color with very minimal head . theres a few chunks of bubbles floating on top but they dont stick around for long . sitting in the glass it just looks fairly average . i can actually see the floor looking through the top , its that see thru .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : reddish brown colored . no head . no lacing .	000000000000
1	a : poured a pitch black with a dark tan colored head . minimal lacing .	0000000000000000
0	a : hazy yellow under a fizzy white head . no retention , no lace . looks more like a hazy glass of lemonade rather than a beer .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a very murky orange with gold tint when held to the light . has a huge fluffy white head with substantial retention , which means it takes several pours to get this all into a 1l glass . generous ivy lacing down the sides , with bubbles up the center . the head eventually dissolves into an ice cream scoop-style lump in the center of the brew . fantastic look .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : it looks like pee but more clear	000000000
0	a : murky blond , very little head , but left a hint of lace . they should really throw some finings in this !	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : the appearance is just a bland yellow with no head .	0000000000000
1	appearance : right off the bat the hop rod rye ale from bear republic is one of the nicer looking beers i 've seen . it is a beautifully clear caramelized red-orange color . the only drawback , however , is the lack of head you get from the beer . even after a vigorous pour , i was only able to get one finger of nice pale white frothy head . once this dissipates , you pretty much have to beg it to come back . for this reason alone , i suggest pouring only a few ounces at a time and then refilling as you go .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : wow , fantastic , this is what a big stout is supposed to look like inky black with a dark stained mocha wood foamy head that is rich and creamy .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : rich dark copper . darker than most . minimal white head is leaving minimal lacing behind .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : a dark reddish amber with minimal head and spots of lacing smells : a sweet dark fruit and a mild alcohol note . tastes : it has a real pine like hop that is enjoyably bitter and well balanced .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pale yellow body with about a finger of head that dissipates quickly .	000000000000000

0	a : pours a slightly murky pale straw body with almost no head .	00000000000000
0	appearance : flat and pale . nothing attractive at all with this beer .	00000000000000

0	appearance : all look pretty much the same except ice house , its a bit darker .	00000000000000000
1	appearance : pours clear enough to read a paper through . there is about a quarter inch of head on top of this true golden beer that definitely stayed longer than you would see on a budweiser . there are a dozen or so bubbles rising through it after it has been standing for a few minutes , but the head is barely noticeable .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : brown pour , not particularly thick coming out of the bottle , but boy does it look so in the glass . a small white head grows up after a hard pour . not a lot of lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : amber and brown colors come together . nice thick head in the beginning but leaves quickly .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a cloudy orange/golden color . i didnt expect there to be a lot of yeast in this one , however the whole brew ended up with all of these little yeast chunks floating throughout . ive never had this happen to me with other pale ales . the white frothy head rounded the looks out .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : surprisingly yellow in the glass with a small head and poor retention . would benefit from either more color , or less - as is , not very attractive . wheat malt to increase head retention ?	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a gorgeously intense brown/amber color with a tremendously dense tan head that lasts and lasts and lasts .	00000000000000000000

0	a : pure copper color . eh , maybe a touch of amber in there . slim fizzy head .	00000000000000000000

1	appearance : cloudy and honey colored . very nice head with good retention .	00000000000000

1	a : tar black with tan , creamy head .	0000000000
0	a : hiss from the cap and a release of pale wheat-gold . capped with a thin-looking fizzing head of large whitish bubbles ; gone so quickly - i counted 12 seconds between ending the pour and watching the last of the head fade away . a bit of yeast stuck on the bottom ; a swirl of the last ounce or so created a slightly milky haze and a deepened orange color . decent carbonation , no lace whatsoever .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : as served the beer is a nice cleary lightly coppered amber color with a `` off white head that persists for a while and leaves a nice pattern of lacing on the glass as it recedes . eventually the head recedes to a ring of foam but for most of the beer there are speckles of lacing when sipping and there is also lacing clinging to the sides of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : one finger head of slight cream , fair thickness , and average retention . semitransparent orange-yellow colour . appealing . sm : orange peel , cream , maybe cascade hops , and bittering hops .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : as `` black as night '' as the saying is hackneyed . my feeling is it could just as well be swigged straight out of the bottle as admired through a glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this is a real beautiful pint . gold in color , slight chill haze . great 2 finger , fluffy beige head . diminished into a real tight lace that slides all the way down the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : amber color with 1 finger of head that fades quickly with minimal lacing .	0000000000000000
1	a : an initially vigorous pour results in a surprising explosion that fills the tulip entirely while leaving an ounce of barleywine in the bottle . the huge head has all sizes of bubbles and demonstrates impressive retention and lacing . below this striking head is a clear , brilliant red body . what can i say ? im a sucker for good head , and this beer does n't disappoint .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : dark brown to black with large pillowy head after an aggressive pour . the head recedes more slowly than i would have thought leaving nice lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : not that impressed . basically coke with a bit of a slimy lacing in the glass . definitely unimpressive for a porter .	0000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured from a bottle into an irish pub style ( real ) pint glass in low altitude galway , ireland , on september 20th 2010 . pours a urine gold with a three finger head . head is thin and pathetic . this is not an appealing beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a half finger head of nice tan colour , appealing cream , good thickness , and abominable fifteen second retention . colour is an appealing solid black . sm : the aroma is comprised of coffee , chocolate , toffee , cream , and ... popcorn ? what is that doing there ? i do n't know , but i find it strangely appealing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : it pours a luscious golden-orange color with a fluffy finger of off-white head that holds and laces well .	000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours a very dark amber more towards the red side the spectrum . nice head rentention about two fingers worth . the head on it is very foamy witha tan hue . aromas : slight caramel notes . light cinnamon notes and other dried fruits .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : deep copper under a big creamy white head . excellent retention and lace .	0000000000000000
0	a : pours murky ruby-brown with two inches of billowy fine slightly pink head that is extremely slow to subside . the bottle itself is a bit gunky at the mouth/neck . it is as if this were stored upside down for a while and the sediment never made it back to the bottom . a bit unpleasant to look at honestly , hopefully the beer will be fine . i did try to flip the bottle , shake it a bit in hopes of washing things down . that did not work . the best description i can give is that it looked like krausen stuck to the side of a carboy .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a cloudy orange with a tiny tint of red . ridiculous white and fluffy head .	0000000000000000000
1	a : had to pour moderately hard , but it gives a stable 1 '' tan cake . brew is somewhat cloudy chestnut red with slowly rising carbonation . leaves a nearly solid tan curtain of foam on the glass , some of the most impressive lacing i 've ever seen .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : well the body is a beautiful blood red with amazing clarity and steady carbonation . the down side though is that is poured with less the a finger of head that immediately vanished and did n't lace whatsoever .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : poured a cloudy amber colour w/ a finger head that had some lacing	000000000000000
1	a : best looking beer ive seen in a while ; the head is creamy beige monstrosity . it takes literally five minutes to leavewhat retention ! the foam leaves so much frothy lacing above the body , hazy pumpkin in color . good amount of ginger blush on it , but the velvety head steals the show for sure .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : fermented piss never quite looked so bleak and golden . frogs merchandise this beer for a reason : the average u.s. wetland shares a similar color to this beer during the wet seasons of the month .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : very pale yellow in colour , a soda like carbonation races to the top selfishly to leave the brew and not help with the head retention .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : slighly hazy gold body with only the faintest hint of a thin white head . nothing to retain , and no lace . i 'm ok with this headless pour , though , since it means i get to take full advantage of the small glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours a dark auburn body with 2-3 fingers worth of light tan head . next pours also give it more foam . thick coating around and all around very nice .	000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : coffee ( black ) brown , minature rising carbonation although hard to see , perfect even 4 finger head of small to medium bubbles and capucino color .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this is a really pretty beer . rich golden amber hue with a good sized cloudy , wispy head . retention is great for the style and it left thick rings of lace down the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : flocculent yeast dots this primarily dark red-orange beer . i probably should n't have poured the entire bottle in to the glass but at 8 $ , there was no way i was wasting a drop . little head formed and quickly receded .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : tawny , opaque brew . puffy head that deflates almost instantly , leaving no lacing .	000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dark brown with little head .	0000000000
1	a : tawny hue , coming with a very tight , creamy off-white beer head which sustains throughout the drink ... beautiful and quite unusual for a handpump-dispensed ale ( w/o a sparkler ) .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured into my pint glass , this brew pours a perfect black , with an even more perfect dark coffee bean colored head . the only stout that is better in appearance is espresso yeti . if i could i would give this a 4.9 .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : beer poured black as night allowing no light to penetrate . it was beautifully topped by a 2 fingered , frothy cocoa colored head with great retention and loads of lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : an awful looking pale straw colour that looks like a cloudy lemonade with semen in it .	0000000000000000000
0	a : vigorous pour yields a .5 finger coarse mocha colored head with low retention . a thick ring of mocha hangs atop an opaque black brew . lacing is non-existant . pretty shabby .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dark yellow to light brown in color with what appears to be good carbonation but the head we rather week . there is very little lacing left behind either .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : totally transparent , color matching that of a very pale urine sample , head exists , is frothy and white ( has anyone , ever , conceived of corona 's head ? ) .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : black with three finger superfine nitro head	000000000
0	a : a filtered witbier ? ? pale with some green hues , not what i expect from a witbier . decent white head .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : this is the best looking beer i have had , bar none . slightly cloudy/hazy pale yellow , rocky/fluffy sticky head that stayed around for about 10 minutes ( and it was n't a vigorous pour either ) and settled into a 1/2 '' cap and left lacing all over the glass . this is what a beer should look like , imo .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a hazy golden color with a bounteous head that lasts forever and deposits sheets of lace down the side of the chalice	0000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : cloudy , light-copper color with an unusually large amount of suspended particulate matter . small , white head disappears quickly leaving average lacing .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : deep copper color , clear , great rocky head	00000000000
1	a : pure black beer ( dark enough to not see through ) sits underneath a creamy , rich , ashy-beige head that is very thick . it leaves the inner circle when pouring slowing into the metal of the glass . very appealing !	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : very dark brown with a creamy light brown , two finger head . very nice , and just how i would like a stout to look . a decent bit of the head lingered for most of the glass , with a high amount of lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a translucent amber , with over two fingers of off white head from a slow pour . very nice lacing and retention .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : gentle pour yields a .5 finger coarse , white head that dissipates quickly . beer is one of the palest looking ipas i 've ever seen . a semi-clear white peach . lacing is stringy and spotty in parts with little cling .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dark burgundy in color . lots of sediment floating around .	0000000000000
0	appearance : pours a huge , four finger tannish head that takes a long time to recede . body is dark brownish amber in color . not sure what was going on with the head on this one , but once it settled down the appearance was great .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a somewhat vigorous pour ( i already sampled and ris tonight ) yields a pitch black beer with 2 fingers of frothy tan head . extremely dark ... looks like a good stout should . generous lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : looks great ! this one pours a very dark brown/black color . it has a frothy tan head which has rather large bubbles .	00000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : is dark amber maybe even reddish ; it 's very clear and the head is super frothy with a long lasting tan foam .	00000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : black wheat is right ! this dunkel weizen hardly let any light through after the beer was poured and the yeast was added . what light did penetrate the liquid showed it to be a very deep , very murky brown . the tan head rose up to just a little over a finger and dissipated very quickly . i could see a lot of bubbles rising through the beer at the very edge of the glass . these all worked to sustain a thin cap of foam over the beer for the entire drink . there was no lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : nice looking , unique bottle . very cool . i like the bee with the stinger out , it 's for you , beer snob who is too good for this legendary beverage !	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : weak , watery yellow , with a thin loose head which disappears into film quickly . looks very unappealing .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dark reddish brown with a thin brown-tan head . no lacing , no head retention .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : clear light gold color with little head . no lacing .	0000000000000
0	a : so pale that it 's almost clear . fizzy white head .	00000000000000
1	a : poured into a pilsener glass . nice clarity . nice medium bright yellow . a very spongy white head that lasted forever and sticks to the glass and hangs there .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured from a 12-ounce bottle into my half-liter generic weissbier glass , penn weizen honestly does n't look perfect . hefeweizens can range in color from a muddy , almost green-tinged yellow to a bright , effervescent orange , and this one leans slightly toward the green-tinged end of the spectrum . still , the old `` weizen pour '' produces a typically impressive three- to four-finger head , with moderate retention throughout drinking .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a very dark brown color with some light showing in around the edges . the head is off-white and short-lived with little retention . there is no lace .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : in a straight pint glass it pours a reddish chestnut hue , coming with a thick , very frothy , off-white beer head full of medium and small air cells , sustaining very well and supported by a constant and moderate carbonation .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear ruby red color , with little head ever appearing , not even a ring remains , no apparent bubbles	0000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a cloudy red/burgundy color with a very weak head .	000000000000
0	appearance : pours a transparent brown color with red highlights . 1/2 '' head is tan colored and very short lived . no lacing whatsoever and some carbonation activity .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a orange gold with creamy white head that leaves lots of spotting .	0000000000000000
0	a : deep reddish-brown with minimal orange-brown head that disipated quickly and left no lacing . this looks more like a brown ale than it does a stout .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours dark brown , with some light passing through . one finger foamy tan head .	000000000000000000
1	a : pours clear copper with a quarter inch of head . fairly carbonated . attractive beer , although somewhat darker for a saison , which is no doubt due to the rye .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this was a bright , clear copper color . it pours with a big , craggy white head that leaves lots of lace in it 's wake .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : initially pours a very deep dark garnet color with a small 1/4 '' head of tan bubbles . the head sticks around for only about 20 seconds to end up as a small ring across the top of the beer . the beer is dark , but it appears that there arent many bubbles rising to maintain the head .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : slightly cloudy pale amber with a thin , rocky head dissolving to a rim right away .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : i 'm not impressed at all with this . some ok lacing , but no foam retention at all . looks like watery coffee . definitely not black .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark black body , surprisingly big bubbles around glass . not much head otherwise . minimal lacing . none too pretty .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : golden color with a good amount of fizzy bubble haze . minimal head , though i 'm guessing i can chalk that up to the waiter 's delicate pour .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : three finger head on a golden glass with considerable protein chunkiness & # 61516 ; flavor : floral hops take the lead , light tripel taste with a little honeydew melon and other light fruits .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : it poured from the bottle looking like old wine . no head , no carbonation . the color was attractive though , showing a deep rosy red with light brown on the sides .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pretty much like every other see-through beer that ab makes . water mixed with a slight bit of urine .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a slightly translucent chocolate color with a sturdy tan head that leaves some webs of lace	0000000000000000000
0	a : i poured this beer into a standard pint glass . the color could best be described as piss yellow . there is little to no lacing and only a faint trace of head remains .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : nicely black , with a tan head that leaves some nice lacing on the glass	00000000000000000
1	appearance : poured into a great dane pint ... actually a great looking beer - dull amber body , 1/2 '' fluffy white cap that retains itself throughout ... .nice	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a hazy bright yellow , looking like a hay field . provides a nice 2 finger foam head with superb retention . there is a thick layer of lacing as well .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours black with only a half-finger of tan head even with a rough pour . it quickly fades into nothing , leaving no lacing behind .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : deep murky brown in colour with a short , fizzy light brown head that fades away rather quick leaving you with what looks like a glass of mucky water .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : favorite part ? the prop . 65 warning that states : `` some materials used in the colored decorations on this product contain cadmium a chemcial known to the state of california to cause birth defects '' . that made me laugh , gee if you are a pregnent mother and considering a drinking a bottle of old gaurdian , then i think the kid is gon na have worse things to worry about than the cadmium ( what ever that is ) . ok but seriously ...	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : beautiful copper color , not orange ... nice fluffy off white foam and extreme lace left !	0000000000000000000
1	a : poured a nice deep yellow with a two finger head that left beautiful lacing down the side as it subsided .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a very dark brown with a two-finger light brown head with poor retention but sticks around on the edges .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : it pours a completely opaque black color with two fingers of white nitro froth that laces incredibly well .	000000000000000000000
0	a : bright , clear straw yellow . poured a 1 finger foamy white head that dissipated quickly to a skim that disappeared in a minute or two . decanted continually . thin , inconsistent lacing after the first couple drinks , then nothing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : a really beautiful beer with dark brown hue and thick , two finger tan head with lots of lacing .	0000000000000000000000
0	appearance : clear and extraordinarily pale , just a shade above invisible , with bubbly bone-white foam above , short in duration .	00000000000000000000000
0	appearance : deep dark brown with mild carbonation . pours a very thin off white head that disappears immediately into an almost non-existent film , which eventually disappears itself . slightly disappointing actually .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this pours a murky dark cinnamon brown color and is topped with a massive tan colored head which slowly spiderwebs its way down the glass . this looks amazing . oh and i rarely comment on this but it comes in a pretty bad ass bottle showing a sort of eclipse of the earth .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : opaque peach/ruby red color . i think a saw a yeastie or two float by . nearly three fingers of white , fizzy soda pop head that falls fairly quickly and leaves no lacing behind . 4.0	000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : dark golden to amber color , one finger head with some lacing and lightly carbonated	00000000000000000

0	a : dull yellow color , ephemeral head and some sediments at the bottom ;	000000000000000
1	appearance : black with quite a bit of carbonation evident . bubbles racing to the top everywhere . big 2-3 finger tan head is medium thick , fluffy , and retains very well . a relatively thick head remains until the end . thick lacing down the glass . nice .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : very dark black pour . two finger tan head that is very creamy and has excellent retention and beautiful lacing .	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a very nice hazy rust color . the head on this beer is unbelievable . thick and bubbly . it looks like rising bread dough . naturally , it leaves a thick , persistent lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dark amber/ruby red with very low carbonation , really no head , good retention for what is there , but not a horrible appearance , i would have expected better from port , but let 's move on .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : when i think winter beer , i usually associate it with a dark , amber colored beer . this beer looked exactly like the amber ale they serve . it was a reddish amber color ... very light but it yielded a decent head that had some nice lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark brown with a slight cherry hue . short head quickly disperses to edges of glass .	0000000000000000000

1	a : golden and straw colored mostly opaque with moderate cloudiness and a shimmering of orange when put up to the light . visible carbonation , this is one fizzy looking beer ! pours with a thick creamy and towering white foamy head . heavy and sparkling lacing . wow , perfect example of the style !	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : very yellow , golden color . nice clear and bubbly body . i got two plus fingers of pearly head on this beer that left remarkable lacing . looks sticky , yet light enough to be bubbly . it is very beautiful to look at , actually .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a lot of reviews called this cloudy . did victory recently start filtering this ? my growler pour was a perfectly clear golden color . it poured with a moderate sized head . i 'm generally not picky about a beers appearance , but hefes are different and this just did n't look right .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pale gold color , very clear , decent sized head but dissipated quickly , almost no lacing .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : clear gold glass starts with an active finger white head that dies quickly and fails to lace . flavor : the blueberry is mild and has a jam like quality . base beer is balanced between hop and malt so closely that neither flavor stands out . unfortunately , theres buttery ( diacetyl ) note that makes the whole experience a little less enjoyable .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : more red in color than anything else has an off white head , not quite an inch worth that recedes to a cap about a quarter of an inch thick . decent clarity on the initial pour . interesting looking beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : little or no head or lacing on glass , but a beautiful ruby orange color . a few fines were floating around .	0000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : dark mahogany/cherry with a ruddy head that had great retention	000000000000
1	appearance : pours a clear , gold body with a small white head .	00000000000000
0	a : pale straw body , with a very foamy white head .	0000000000000
0	a : dark brown , close to black color . pour did n't really yield a head . 4.0	0000000000000000000
1	appearance : opaque reddish brown with an inch tall white head .	000000000000
0	appearance : honestly , it pretty much looks like miller lite , there 's not much haze , lacing 's alright , and the head fades pretty quickly .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : hazy orange . really nice head with exceptional retention . very nice lacing .	0000000000000000
1	a : `` one-of-a-kind '' . pitch black in color . an extraordinary 2-finger head . i do n't often use this word to describe a beer , but the appearence is just `` perfect '' .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a hazy yellow . the head is a half finger of light cream , decent thickness , and bad retention . sm : light lemon citrus esters and cream over a light clean barley foundation . a bit simple , but pleasant and refreshing . very well balanced .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : thin lacing with a troubled head retention , faint haze on the rusty brown brew .	000000000000000000
1	a : black body with dark tan head of two fingers with a good cap and lacing . s/t : simple and straightforward , with little more than some basic chocolate , some sweet toasted malts , and some light smoke to offer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark black , with no light able to get through , with a decent about of head even with a slow pour . the head is mocha colored and leaves some lace .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : body is a deep reddish amber - shows flashes of crimson and mahogany . as with all of the beers at the sn brewery , the carbonation is constant and active ; however the column of bubbles is not quite as dense . a big , fluffy , white , foamy head sits on top - looks just like a bubble bath . great head retention and tons of clumpy , foamy lace all the way down . i can find no flaws .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : hazy orange and cloudy with a terrific meringue head that built its on structure on this bad boy with staying power . a truly great looking beer . a plethera of sediment on the bottom of the glass . n : banana bread and lemon . scents of a moisturizer and liquid soap , oddly in a good way . the hops are there but not as much as the brooklyn version which is unfortunate .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured this beer from a bottle that has been sitting in the basement for a while . possibly because of this , the head retention is poor . none the less the glass is laced nicely .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours a crisp , translucent golden body , capped by a magnificent foamy , sticky white head , the retention on which was amazing . the lacing is also fantastic for the style , stringy and delicate but sticky nonetheless . the carbonation is also off the hook , fast and fine-bubbled , plentiful and well-dispersed . just a very attractive beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a very clear , bright yellow . carbonation is highly active with mixed sized bubbles that creates a sticky , delicate , foamy pure white brussels lace head . bottled-conditioned , so there will be dregs in the bottle .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : ruby and copper with haze and not a great deal of head . as a result of the substantial quantity of yeast in the bottle , a few random little globs are floating in my glass . perhaps my dinner will be bottle conditioned by it later this evening .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : on tap , it pours a not-too-bad-looking pale straw color with a foamy one and a 2 finger head . honestly , it 's not too bad looking , and the head does n't look so bad seems like fosters , it does n't taste as good as it looks .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : a thin , transparent brown pour produces a 1+ finger , medium looking , light brown head with good retention . dark brown and slightly mahogany in color , transparent body , and very active carbonation for the style . head slowly fades to a good film cap , but only a ring remains and leaves no real lacing down the glass . could be a little darker and the carbonation could be toned back a little .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : slow pour down the side and middle of the glass yields a two inch , silky offwhite head that dissipates slowly , leaving walls of lacing . pours a deep , semi-opaque reddish amber . leaves a solid wall of lacing on one side of the glass , and huge streaks and latticework elsewhere . lacing sticks around indefinitely . great .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : cap was rusted from the inside out , cork had leaked and smelled damp . cork made no pop on opening , and pour produced no head almost flat . has a gold orange color .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : medium brown in color without the red hues common to porters . the head is thin and dissipates quickly . scent : malty sweet aroma with notes of honey . the sweetness is not rich enough to be called molasses , but perhaps is closer to caramel . no discernable hops aroma .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : widget lends to impressive cascading effect , dark black/brown fades to rich mahogony , with creamy off-white head , great lacing , i think guinness invented lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : 5 |	0000
1	a : it looks pretty damn good looking , a healthy dark brown almost clear black if that makes any sense , but you know what i mean , clear and dark . there is an initially creamy two inch tiny bubbled light sandy head that fades into a thin cap in five minutes or so . lacing is very thick and defined all the way around the glass . looks good .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : 2.5 ,	0000
0	a : hmm , not a great head , really . it 's thin and very large bubbles , and it 's fading fast . it 's light tan , and it 's gone . the beer itself is an amber-brown with lots of active carbonation . it 's also got a heck of a haze to it . this is not a very pretty looking beer in my opinion .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark brown , near opaque ; short-lived coffee-colored head ; some lacing , but not much .	0000000000000000000
0	a : super dark brown colored beer . even with super aggressive pour , near no head ( mocha colored ) with really bad retention . also , the lacing is pretty bad considering the abv .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : this beer looked glorious , it came from an illuminating tap handle with a count sitting atop it .	000000000000000000000
0	a : murky brown , mahogany body with a fluffy and creamy off-white head . it settled out very quickly into a thin ring around the walls . minor splotchy lacing accompanied , but overall this is rather ugly looking beer . it 's hard to be to harsh considering this is essentially what pureed raspberries look like .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : split the pour with someone , theirs turned out a slightly hazy orange amber with a rocky white head ; mine turned out a very yeast-laden clouded amber with noticeable sediment . strange .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dude ! it 's purple ! extreme beer ? well , extreme color anyway ! this does have the appearance of carbonated blueberry juice , complete with soapy purple head that disappeared within seconds . zero lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very pale yellow color with a huge white head which stayed around longer than its ice counterpart .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : very hazy brown colored . small head . does not look appetizing .	000000000000000
1	a : i once heard that the darkest place on earth is not even 100 % black . clearly my source never had his head submerged in a glass of the world wide stout . this is really black . no , this is what really black wants to be when it grows up . ummmm ... kind of small head and , during it 's short life , i could tell it was creamy and light brown . completely opaque body . s &	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a dark brown porter color with a very modest head that quickly drops to a ringlet and fails to lace the glass - odd for a wheat beer	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured just a tad too quickly and the head is massive . effervescent , champagne like quality . the head is very slow to fade . laces nicely . very transparent golden color . awesome .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy golden ale with a finger of transient white foam . spotty lace .	0000000000000000
0	appearance : chestnut brown body with a slight copper hint . pours with massively high levels of carbonation at first , but the head rescinds almost immediately quite astonishing i have never seen such a large head form & disappear so quickly without leaving any lace traces at all . oh , but wait i have ; its like pouring a lively cold soda into a warm glass it fizzes and pops as it settles to a flat appearance ! it drops marks for that im afraid because now im expecting a cola-beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : impressive , corked 750ml bottle with gold ink , poured into a schooner . pours a dark brown , mahogany color with a thick off-white head . good clarity .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured a rich , shiny amber color with a very healthy head - a very inviting look .	00000000000000000000
0	a : poured a golden amber color with a slight chilled haze and a thin film of carbonation leaving no real lace .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : dark brown and toasty with one finger light brown head . when held up to light a very small amount of light penetrates .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : this beer is about as clear as they get . even less color than say a miller lite or bud light .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : vigorous pour yields a .5 finger coarse light cream colored head that dissipates quickly into a thin film at the top . brew is a clear mahogany that reveals a highly carbonated body .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a deep amber with an airy off-white head that lasts during the entire session , and laces incredibly down the glass .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a cloudy , murky , dark brown color like tootsie rolls , slight reddish hue as the light hits it ; two finger-width head , medium lacing . this is a pretty ugly beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : just like the regular ruination , the double dry hopped version pours a light , yellow straw color . the head was about a quarter-inch thick in a large snifter and there was no lacing at all .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours do n't get much more perfect than this . a fluffy , gummy head of yellowish tan at least two fingers thick sits atop the liquid . it collapses at the slowest of paces , leaving tons of bubbled swiss cheese walls of lace on the sides of the glass as it does . under this puffy crown , a light orange and caramel brown brew waits , nearly opaque and cloudy in some spots and merely hazy in others .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : coffee with cream dark ( watery ) . in all fairness i think the bar may water down the beer .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : rich , translucent golden color with 1.5 fingers of bright white head that diminishes quickly . no lacing remains on the glass . this beer is a few shades darker in color that most wheat beers .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : not as syrupy looking as i 'd expected . as much head as would be anticipated for a 10 % . middle of the road stout looking .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a vibrant goldlen ale with a strong haze . towering snow white head ... frothy and creamy . looks like scoops of whipped cream .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a mostly clear golden with some amber highlights . a vigorous pour produced a head with the approximate thickness of a fingernail . retention is obviously non-existent as a scant ring of bubbles lines the top of the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : big , bright white 3 finger head with a swirling tempest of carbonation feeding it .	000000000000000000
0	a : golden ale with near excellent clarity and no head formation . a broken sheet of white head . no lace .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a really vibrant yellow , more reminicient of lemonade than urine though .	0000000000000000
0	a : what 's up with cheap home-computer printed label ? anyway , pours dark , dark brown with virtually no head . not unattractive , not the most attractive	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the beer is a deep dark brown color with a reddish hue , creates a dense , foamy , tan head that fades slowly and leaves a very thick lace on the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours black , tan head .	00000000
0	a : a hazy light brown color with a thin tan colored head .	00000000000000
1	appearance : it 's a triple bock , so it should be nice and dark , which it is . it clings to the sides of the glass like a brandy does , which is fine with me because i like brandy .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : black as black can be with a tan head that was one finger thick and disappated to thick ring after about a minute .	00000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a thin straw colored beer with a few bubbles floating to a weak head that briskly disappeared .	00000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours just like the adverts . looks beautiful . fluffy white head compliments the golden body . lacing down the glass with effervescent wondertude .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : this beer was a cloudy medium brown color . there was a small head with slight retention .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : little to no head and two shades from black . not sure how this is supposed to be served but it was on the same co2 as the rest of the beers and even after i stirred it up the head dropped like a soda .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours near no head . just a thin white wisp atop a golde , slightly cloudy , yellow beer . no lacing . very lightly carbonated but appropriate for its style .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear , golden yellow , white head , very little retention or lace .	0000000000000000
1	a : that is what a hefeweizen should look like : cloudy and deep golden/wheat-colored , crowned by a billowing dollop of rich white sea-foam . head drops slowly over several minutes to a clumpy cream .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : clear copper color , huge head that volcanoes out of the glass .	000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a clear yellowish orange color with a 3 '' + head . the head lingered around a while . thick lacing painted the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy apricot with minimal carbonation . soapy eggshell cap has poor retention . it quickly dissolves and leaves the beer looking like apricot cider . no lace is left behind .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : aggressive pour yields 1.5 fingers of dense brown head with good retention . black opaque liquid . perfect .	000000000000000000000
0	a : thin , brown pour with no head or lacing . looks like flat coke . the only place where this beer does n't shine	00000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : too-clear light golden color . non-existent head . i want a witbier to be cloudy and foamy !	00000000000000000000
0	a : pours a somewhat dark brown , yet slightly amber that is n't opaque at all . head is about half a finger and leaves quickly . not too much lacing going on here . does n't seem to have to porter appearance .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy orange , and not just because of the yeast . half inch white head , faded , no lacing .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark brown body . i want to check out the edges and see if it 's translucent , but the head -- 3 fingers of huge , fluffy bubbles -- lasts forever . it collapses in sections and is easily stirred up by a gentle second pour . i was told this is infected , so i was n't surprised to see this .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : painfully bright yellow glass holds a finger head of snowcapped white that gives good lacing to the glass . flavor : over sweet , first blush tasted of turkey for some odd reason . thats a completely new one on me , got it in the second taste as well ; cold cut turkey . taste quickly goes over to a bit of corn , mild flash of leafy hops , then just a faint metallic finish .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pale yellow and cloudy , like near hefe cloudy with very little carbonation in the body . the pour produced not even half a finger of head , which did sustain but did not lace .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : ultra-clear light golden color . very thin , white head that dissipates quickly .	0000000000000000
0	a : pours a semi-clear reddish dark brown . very small white head . little retention and no lacing .	00000000000000000000
0	a : poured moderately aggressively , it formed a brief head that dissipated to a mere ring very quickly , leaving very light lacing on the glass . dark copper , almost light brown in appearance , vaguely murky , moderate carbonation visible .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : uh oh : i do n't remember this being ridiculously overcarbonated . the opaque reddish-brown body looks rather muddy , and is topped by a solid off-white head that towers a full inch over the top of the tulip - i.e. , it 's ginormous . i wonder whether there might not have been some secondary fermentation going on ; in a fruit beer , that could actually be pretty great .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a deep ruby amber with lots of hazing . a huge fluffy head forms and wo n't go away , lol . some patching lace from the head .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : rich , clear pale amber body under an inch of frothy , creamy tan foam . terrific retention , heavy lace . gorgeous lager .	000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : thick white/tan chunky head with excellent retention and nice lacing . beautifully clear , deep penny copper color . a better looking red ale you 'll be hard pressed to find .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pale brownish straw . clear with a great white head and stellar lacing .	0000000000000000
0	a : pours a very light yellow color with medium amount of white head that quickly is gone .	0000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dark orange with a finger of off-white head that recedes into a thin layer with little lacing .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : somewhat of a murky ruby red color with the beginnings of a head around the edge of my caracole tulip , but no real head to speak of .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a deep red/dark honey type color . soapy light tan one finger head that dissipates into a nice ring . very good carbonation , consistent bubbling	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : it 's a dark amber or bronze color that is brilliantly clear . the head is a foamy eggshell white that stands about a finger and a half . lots of carbonation is visible , refracting sunburst hues of yellow and orange ( i know that 's worded pretty funny but that 's what came to mind when i looked at it ) . a whole lot of lacing !	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : almost clear copper with a 1.5 finger light tan foam head that dissipates into a nice thick lacing and coating .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : nothing special here . an amber brew , clear as day , with a fizzy white head that recedes and does not lace . may as well be a pale ale ...	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark , almost opaque with a small amount of coffee color peeking through the edges small-medium head dissipates quickly and leaves little lacing .	00000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : gorgeous , crystal clear copper color with a very nice , thick head ... part of the 22 oz . bottle poured into a 16 oz . pint glass left a solid finger-full of fluffy head . as the beer sat it became more opaque . lacing was heavier at the top of the glass than further down and the lacing up top clung to the glass throughout the entire 22 ounces .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : brownish amber color with a mercy haze head : light brown with a nice frosty head	000000000000000000
1	a : pours a murky brown body , translucent at the edges but dark in the center . the head is two fingers of light tan foam that recedes quickly into a short-lived cap and then a moderate collar at the edges . some lacing as i sip .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a translucent amber color . has a thin , yet foamy , head that dissipates slowly and leaves spotty lacing . has less of a head than i would 've expected .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured a half finger white copper head that settled to a thin cap . color is a very deep garnet hued amber color . carbonation can be seen streaming to the top from the middle of the glass like an ocean vent . lacing and glass presence is great lasting 45 min into the pour .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear light amber with a finger or so of fizzy white head . the head disappears pretty quickly , leaving a little layer in the middle - not much retention , no lacing . s/t : smells and tastes like a mediocre belgian pale . it 's true to style , not bad , not outstanding .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a midnight black with 3 fingers of dark mocha head . retention is great ; it takes several minutes before the cap relaxes into a manageable half-finger of even covering on the brew . nice lacing as it recedes , and broken sheets of lacing down the sides during a sip ( with quite a lot of it sticking ) . i ca n't imagine an 11 % ris looking any better .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured a pinkish orange with yellow highlights that had absolutely no head and no lacing at all sticking to the glass . it looks like a colorful barrel aged beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : deep dark color with a milk chocolate mocha colored that never completely fades . very good .	0000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours an opaque , brown body with a small , off-white head .	000000000000000
1	a : pours pure , rocky , belgian-looking foam , which fill glass and then some . eventually the head recedes , leaving spectacular brussels lacing and beer that is clear deep gold . exuberant effervescence .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this is probably the most gorgeous pale beer i 've seen up to this point . it 's a hazy , bright , pale straw color with a full 3 fingers of egg-shell white head . retention is ridiculous , and lacing is incredible . superb .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours pretty clear , full of carbonation with a small head that quickly fades . basically standard macro fare .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear cherry wood into a dfh signature glass with a finger of off white ( the gf said eggshell , sounds good to me ) . the head dissipates rather quickly and the left behind bubbles cling to the glass and leaves nice little rings .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : black . it 's not overly thick like oil , but more like having the consistancy of grape juice . has a dark brown/light black one-finger head which lasts a good minute or two and leaves nice foamy lacing on the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : an unpleasant yellow color , with virtually no head .	000000000000
1	appearance : pours a deep , dark brown that still shows a little bit of light through it . ruby red highlights shine . the head is tan with a height of one inch.the head is cakey and has deep craters . plenty of lace clings to the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear dark brown with red hues and lots of tiny little bubbles . two-finger , off-white , creamy head that lasted a while . very nice lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear light yellow with less than a finger of white head . not a lot of retention , pretty much no lacing .	000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours out a very thin and light brown and completely transparent . yields a two finger , thinner looking , light beige head with decent retention . clear , transparent brown body with no carbonation evident . a ring remains and leaves some touches of lacing down the glass . this is far too light and transparent to be considered stout looking .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : golden with some slight orange hues . similar to a duval	0000000000000
0	a : pours a clear , honey-brown body with a finger of off-white foam . retention is n't great , but it leaves spots of foam on the glass during sips .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark and cloudy with a reddish-orange tint . large head with big bubbles that recedes slowly . moderately enjoyable but a little too murky for my taste .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a reddish/chestnut brown with mahogany highlights . very thin head that dissipates quickly . thin lacing and low carbonation . n : apple juice , red grapes , maybe blackberries , oak , vanilla and a hint of brett . you can also smell the cabernet sauvignon aromas left over from the barrel aging .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a clear copper color . has an almost non-existent amber-white head that is gone in seconds , and there are no carbonation bubbles visible anywhere- somewhat troublesome .	0000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : poured a deep , probably opaque black ( i do n't have a trusty lamp to test the glass ) . a thin , foamy , tan head developed and dissipated to leave a spotted lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : got to love the creamy cascade of nitro bubbles . pours a clear gold into an american pint and after it settles it has a finger of creamy , thick dirty white head that hangs around for the experience and leaves a beautiful lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a clear amber color with a very nice , frothy head ; leaves plenty of strands of lacing behind	0000000000000000000000
0	appearance : this is a darker brown ale , almost porter-liked in color . it has a nice tan head .	000000000000000000000
1	a : arrives with 1 finger of one of the creamier , frothier heads that i have ever seen . eggshell white and annoyingly long lasting . ten minutes in and the head has n't budged one bit . seriously , can i drink my beer already ? ! ? the body is remarkably clear , bright annealed copper in color . boatload of slow moving bubbles can be seen on the inside . this beer is an absolute stunner in a glass . clearly a 5.0 ...	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : one of the prettiest beers i 've seen tapped . it 's completely unfiltered , as a mix of beautiful red , ripe strawberry hue intertwines with a white peach-honey golden . almost no head - .25 fingers and zero lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark , but not opaque , maroon-mahogany blend in the glass that looks quite inviting at first . a standard pour yields 2 inches of beige-colored foam that retains well and deposits nice lace . not quite as nice as the standard guinness on nitro-tap , but nice just the same .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a big fluffy medium-thick off white head with very good retention . dark brown , almost black , opaque , with some ruby hues . higher levels of carbonation evident in the form of smaller bubbles . head slowly fades to a healthy film cap and leaves some immediate lacing . good film stays with lots of pretty lacing down the glass . looks like a good-looking porter .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : very nice dark crimson color , very little head , does n't look properly carbonated .	000000000000000000
0	appearance : i was expecting something slightly more orange/amber , but instead , this pours more yellow-golden . nice fluffy head on the pour , but it dissipates quickly .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy , deep straw body ( apple juice ? ) with a big white head that rapidly dissipates leaving no lacing or cover .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy amber with very little head . head retention is not that great , and no lace is left in the beer 's wake .	000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : black as night , no light passes thru the beer head : small bubbles that dissipates quickly other than that no head	000000000000000000000000
0	a : spicy fruity with allspice and cherry notes .	0000000000
1	a : lovely presentation . unfiltered pinkish-red radish in color , with a touch of warm amber at the edges . solid 2.75 finger head on a good pour . the head dies quite quickly , leaving just a bit of lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : perfect , very very dark with a large pillowy head that leaves plenty of sticky lace and leaves a thin layer of foam all the way to the last drop of beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the aggressive pour was not too bad for a lager . the bubbly head lasted all of 25 seconds . bubbles dominated the pour making it look a lot like champagne .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very dark with just a bit of red around the edges , thin head , very little lacing .	000000000000000000000
0	a : pours near black . transient foam production is mocha and disappears before i could type this . pretty much a black mirror surface . no lace .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark golden color with a thin white head little lacing lots of carb bubbles and little floating particles i doubt it 's yeast it might be leftover malt or spice particles . if it is indeed yeast it did n't mix with the beer well when swirled .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a beautiful pour with a huge , thick tan head . it glistens like a ruby when held up to the light , and later on shades of brown shine through . plenty of lacing 30 minutes in .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : orangy-amber in color , typical of an ipa . almost identical to the 90 min .	000000000000000000
1	a : deep copper brown color - incredible , dense , rocky head that lasted 3/4-1 inch the entire glass	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : when poured into a mug , the beer was a clear golden yellow color with plenty of carbonation bubbles racing through out the glass . the head of foam was disappointing . all i got was just a little skim of white foam and even that dissipated quickly into oblivion . if i wanted anything , i had swirl it around the glass and even that came as fast as it went .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : bottle gushed into my lucifer goblet . head is huge , retention is amazing and lacing is all over the place . body is the definition of cloudy . spices and yeast everywhere . final pour had sipces and yeast on the head even .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : cloudy amber color with a tint of gold . a nearly nonexistent head clings to the edges of the glass .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : very clear , mahogany in color , and respectable lacing are present , but where is the pillow of head ? this brew could definitelyuse a bigger head .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : she poured a murky , light brown . maybe an inch or so of smooth white head disappeared quickly .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : i had the pleasure of sitting across the table . i was in full adrenaline mode , having stayed up most of the night before ; my heart was pounding in the low 100s , and i was staring at everyone with an intense , but haggard , paranoia . when i saw arne apply some pressure on the cork , i went into the zone . time slowed down . i observed his wan , dullard face adopt a soft grin . i saw the cork slip just a millimeter past his fingers . i should have reached out and caught it , but i wanted to see what would happen next . yes . yes . the bottle was about to burst , all over arne 's pretty face . yes . oomph ! the cork shot out , just inches past his eye . arne , still grinning , had no time to react . if he had been standing just a bit closer , he 'd be a pirate right now . anyway , the beer was grossly overcarbonated to the point of injury . it gushed . in our glasses , it poured a faintly glowing light amber / orange body with good head , good retention , good lace .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a clear , copper-brown with two fingers of off-white head which quickly recedes into a thin ring with no lacing .	000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : lighter than most of its peers from aventinus , ramstein , and erdinger . pours a turbid reddish orange and generates a substantial , fine-gauged head , thats a bit darker than off-white . it resolves down pretty quickly , but leaves a nice sticky sheath on the walls of the glass . the body has a remarkable glow to it , really setting it apart from most beers ive seen and evoking a real sunset . tiny particles can be seen bombarded around the hazy liquid by the rills of tiny bubbles . another victory beer that stimulates close inspection .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours a very deep amber with about two fingers of off-white head . head retention is amazing , as is lacing . a great looking beer .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : copper color with a nice 2 finger white head . the lacing on this one is fantastic ...	00000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy , pale yellow color ( i mean really cloudy as in you ca n't see anything through it . poured a 1 finger fizzy white head . minimal lacing . loads of yeast in the bottom of the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : it 's pale yellow with some fine sediment suspended throughout . very little retention and no lacing .	00000000000000000000
1	a : pours a somewhat cloudy pale pink with a beautiful pinkish-white head that never goes away and leaves one the nicest , stickiest laces i 've ever seen . gorgeous .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : cloudy with lots of sediment and carbonation , good head but short lived although the lacy hung around throughout the sampling .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured from the bottle into a lindemans lambic glass ( not the ideal way of sampling this one ) . experimental cassis pours a dark maroon topped with a thin wisp of salmon .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : did not look like a typical doppelbock . much lighter in color . in fact , it looked like a red ale more than a doppelbock . some amber tints , not much lacing or head retention .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : brilliant , crystal clear , deep copper with a fluffy , perfectly white , quarter-inch head . of course , it is all poured out of one of the best looking containers on the market , the nearly solid green can . excellent layered lacing . sort of reminded me of an archeological dig - each layer of perfectly preserved lacing represented a sip .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the first two glasses i poured out of the bottle were crystal clear golden colors , the last looked more like a witbier as it was slightly hazy from the bottle conditioning yeast . i had to pour slowly due to massive creamy head formation . the head fades in spots and does n't in others , making it look like melted marshmallows are floating in the beer . this is by far the best lacing beer i 've ever had . my empty glass is filled with tons of bubbling foam and lace , it looks like my glass was once filled with whipped cream . amazing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : dark brown with a very brown head that abundantly fills the pint glass . it 's also long lasting , this beer looks like a champ .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : the beer has a ruby opaqueness to light . the head of the beer is a light tan coloration with good retention .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : color was a bit darker than i expected for a witbier . excellent white head , but surprisingly very little lace . was n't very cloudy .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : as poured the beer is a cloudy antique gold color with a 1 `` fluffy white head that recedes slowly . there are rings and legs of lacing clinging to the sides of the glass and sipping creates sheets and legs and small patches of lacing , some of which cling to the side and some of which slide back down to the liquid . even mid-way through the beer there is still a 1/8 '' layer of foam covering the liquid .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pale straw ... .ok , these are my notes and maybe i should have had this earlier in the session because i wrote `` hazy clear '' . as god is my witness , i have no more idea what that means than you do . no head to speak of .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : super murky amber haze . very little head , looks sort of like dirty pond water , i am not too appetized , but more intimidated by its looks .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pint glass . pours copper-orange with a one finger white head that recedes immediately . minimal lacing .	00000000000000000000
1	a : reddish black . pours with a plethora of off-white , fluffy head . some retention , but erdinger glass seems to continually generate head . nice lacing . awesome !	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : looks great , nice straw-yellow milky pour with a huge off-white head . smell &	00000000000000000
1	a : poured into a tripel kameliet glass . looks delicious . whats amazing is how dark the head is . not tan , but dark like dark chocolate , especially when you swirl the glass a bit .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark black with little lacing .	00000000
1	a : golden with hints of yellow , brown and orange . excellent head retention and lacing . surly beers always look amazing !	000000000000000000000000
1	a : generous head atop an ostensibly molasses-black body . in decent lighting , the beer is translucent and a drop-dead gorgeous wine-dark red .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : it poured a thick , black with a massive dark chocolate three finger sticky head . the head receded slowly and left an even cover of medium and small bubbles over the liquid and thick chunky lacing that lined the entire glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : golden hazy goodness with an off-white head and some sticky lacing	0000000000000
1	appearance : pours a mostly clear mahogany with a finger of fluffy , off white head . there is good head retention and some nice lacing .	000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : the head is massive , dark brown , sticky and lasting . looks like meringue . glass is black with thick slightly murky brown edges . flavor : all over the map . chocolate malt , burnt roasted grain , baked apple ( no spice ) , pumpkin meat , slightly metallic sharp hop finish . for all of that , its surprisingly mellow and has some crazy form of balance . alcohol is a bit fusel , but felt much more than tasted . a belgian yeast characteristic comes out once you are a bit used to all thats going on in here .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured a hazy straw into an american shaker pint with a white head that did n't hang around and left no lacing .	0000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : poured a clear , pale brownish yellow color . half finger fizzy white head that disappears immediately . visible carbonation . no lacing .	00000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured into a weizen glass from the 12oz bottle . the beer is a hazy pale golden color , not quite as cloudy as some wits i 've seen . head was about 2 and a half fingers thick and pure white with poor retention . par for the style .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours with an eighth-finger or so foam with some surface haze . reminds one of cloud cover on a view of the globe . lacing is spotty in formation but consistent . body is the highlight - a ruby red amber that is just striking - some blond accents . beautiful looking beer , really , if mostly for the body .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clouded mahogany with a nice half-inch of white head ; average lacing . beautiful .	0000000000000000000
0	a : pours an amber orange with a fizzy light white head , no lace . minor floaties , not the most attractive brew .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : orange amber ... clear , poured no head ... none ! a little very thin foam ring is all . only a touch of carbonation . by midway through the glass it looked just like a dark apple juice in clolour & carbonation ( very average ) .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : looks absolutely fantastic . dark opaque brown , and very ruby-red tinted when held up to the light . one of the darkest belgian dubbel 's i 've seen myself .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : standard pour yields a 2 finger frothy white head that dissipates quickly . beer is a cloudy sunshine yellow . lacing is near non-existent with only a few spots here and there .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : my initial reaction was that this beer looks pretty think for a pale ale . the head cascades pretty well in a pint glass . carbonation is lively but does n't keep the head alive for a long time . i love the unfiltered murky beers , a nice dark golden color with even lighter accents .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the pour is a dark , dark brown color -- bordering on black -- with a creamy tan head resting on top .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : black as night , with no light passing through . the finger or so peppery brown head departed our dimension ( or did it ? ) with in a minute or so . great retention on this baby .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours black with a fizzy medium tan head , average retention , some lace .	00000000000000000

0	a : black , tan head , very little retention or lace .	0000000000000
0	appearance : brownish gold in color , cloudy , minimal head , medium carbonation	00000000000000
1	appearance : a nice transparent orangey brown , but the head was stubborn to form and did n't stick around very long .	00000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a clear reddish amber color . head is a thin layer of foam , no real lacing to be seen .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : translucent dark orange colored beer . no carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass . egg shell white head that leaves a decent lacing on the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the saison has a hazy yellow-orange color with big head that does not lace well .	000000000000000000

1	a : 1 and quarter creamy , fluffy white head with fantastic , thick lacing clinging to the sides of the glass . brew itself was a cloudy goldenrod color .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : comes out as a caramel colored amber . head is tan that fizzled away like i a coke . it even made noises like coke	000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a midnight brown that fades to tawny at the edges with a very modest head that manages to hang around as a film and leaves just a few spots of lace	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear , medium orange . very active carbonation . even with a very gentle pour , creates a nice billowy head that stays with the beer . nice lacing . this is exactly what a tripel should look like .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a pale yellow with lots of quickly building head . 2.5 '' tall , off-white color . the beer is amazingly clear , unlike a lot of the beer i 've been drinking lately . good retention , lots of pillowy craters . the fun continues as a single stream of bubbles steadies itself to the top of the beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very light amber , clear , weak head , poor carbonation .	00000000000000
0	a : pours a nearly headless floral colored hue of ruby grapefruit pink . a few bubbles popped up with the pour but after a second this beer looks as flat as a cup of cranberry juice . the first pour was crystal clear but the second was a slightly cloudy .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : goldenrod with a thick , foamy head and a massive stream of champagne-like bubbles . heavy lacing .	00000000000000000000
0	a : solid black ; the carbonation is not pronounced , with the head dissipating relatively quickly	00000000000000000
1	a : mohogany red brown with a fluffy tan head that lingered for a few minutes . very pretty in the snifter looking glass .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear golden yellow color , with a tiny white head receding quickly to nothing - looks almost flat .	000000000000000000000
1	a : light amber color with white head .	000000000
1	a : when decanted into my duvel tulip , this one foams up like crazy . there 's a 3-finger dense dark brown head that looks like it is n't going anywhere , which is ridiculous for the abv on this puppy . as the head slips away slowly , it leaves some patchy foam on the side of my glass . as for the beer itself ? not quite black . very dark brown with reddish brown highlights	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : the beer pours a light brown color with an off-white head .	00000000000000
0	a : foamy mess of a beer . i started to pour this one and in a split second it was on the floor . 9/10 of the glass was full of foam . insane retention ( not a good thing ) with nice lace . had i not poured it all over the floor i would have been a bit more forgiving .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : it has a swiftly vanishing head . the beer is unfiltered and orange in color .	000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a very nice crystal clear golden beer with large carbonation bubbles that give way to a very patchy large bubbled foam head that lasts for quite sometime , then goes near still with some lace .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : it poured a hazy brownish-orange body with a barely there quarter finger off-white head . the head receded to an inconsistent bit of cover that was fed by a moderate stream of bubbles . there was a veritable not there amount of lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : the beer pours a very clear yellow color with a small cap of small bubbles after a pretty quick pour , and then the head faded into a small ring pretty quickly ... within about 20 seconds . there is a small amount of lace left on the glass after drinking .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : unfortunately completely headless but the color is a nice rust/brown	000000000000

1	appearance : let 's face it ... few beers look better than a 'draft ' pint of guinness . the creamy tan head , the deep black body , and sharp line between them ... the classic , and perfect , look . a sight to behold ...	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : has a very clear yellow color with lots of carbonation and quick thinning head .	00000000000000000
1	a : gentle pour ( in case there was sediment - there was n't ) yields 2/3 finger creamy cream colored head with great retention . crystal clear deep orangey-crimson liquid .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : standard pour yields a single layer of coarse white bubbles atop a cloudy grapefruit beer that dissipates quickly . lacing is spotty and with moderate cling .	00000000000000000000000000000

1	a : nice amber color , initial two finger head with nice lacing .	00000000000000

0	a : burnt orange color . cloudy , not translucent . aggressive pour gives a near non existent head , that quickly dissipates to a ring . head is off white . presence of lacing	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : golden colored with a thick , 2 finger head . extremely heavy lacing .	0000000000000000
1	appearance : the color of the beer is black and opaque . the deep mocha colored head is thick , rich , lustrous , and long-lasting .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy amber with a 1/8 '' tan head which dissipated quickly .	00000000000000

1	a : black as engine oil , little or no head .	000000000000

1	appearance : pours a dark brown with ruby red highlights . the head rises 3 '' and is khaki in color . retention is great and there is some decent lace .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : black body with reddish-brown tinges around the edges of the glass , underneath a small , frothy , light-brown head that dissipates quickly . surprisingly decent lacing . decidedly average-looking , as i 've come to expect from bar .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy and light yellow . this is a beer that looks like lemonade . kinda off-putting . pours to a half-finger head that dissipates over the next few minutes .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours like black , well-used motor oil ; dark tan head , no retention or lace .	0000000000000000000
0	a : pours with a 2 finger head that is bright white and does not last long at all . the body is cloudy if not semi-murky and is light yellow in color and ridiculously pale .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : boddingtons looks great . crack open the attractive yellow can and hold it over a pint glass so you do n't miss any of the cream head that begins to form . the bottom is a pale yellow , but it 's fun to keep your eyes on the pillowy head that forms at the top .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours black with two fingers of khaki head that recedes into a creamy cap with good lacing .	00000000000000000000
1	a : pours out an awesome pure harvest gold with an enormous 1.5 '' head of solid white merengue . head winds down very , very slowly , never quite lifitng , and the champagne-like bubbles just keep on gurgling . very nice . n : spicy fumes , slight biscuit and saltine , herbal bread dough , alcohol , down . somewhat incomplete , sort of halfway between a weak saison and a passable champagne or sparkling wine . p : an odd one . initial euro-hoppy and light malt tones blend hand in hand with a off-sourness and bread dough/biscuit neutrality that does n't quite gel . this leads to an end palate of green fruits , a touch more sourness ( but in a juicy , almost fruit like way-not at all like a gueze or a lambic ) , water crackers , overcooked green vegetables ( particularly green beans and broccoli ) , and light floral tones . some seaweed , green algae even . the whole brew tastes rather `` green '' and `` underripe '' , as if it were trying to capture the flavors of fruits eaten before , or vegetables consumed after , peak . the grain quality starts to show a bit more as the beer warms .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : sweet malts , very pronounced sour cherries , candied sugar , alcohol , and yeast .	000000000000000000
1	a : pours a deep dark black with a moderate-but frothy off-white head that dissipated quickly but clung to the glass well . the head on this beer had that look of `` pancake batter '' that i like so much . 4.5 .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : light amber , fairly clear . very little carbonation . this bottle had a ton of sediment in suspension -- not sure what that means , but if i did n't already know what it was i might 've thought it was dirt or something .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : motor oil pour . quite a bit of head for the style . mocha-tan in color . tons of lacing .	00000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a pale yellow beer with a thin white foam lace that dies quickly .	00000000000000000
1	appearance : harsh pour results in an abundant head over 2 inches high despite the large surface area . deep ruby red that is dark enough to make the beer translucent . light brown head does n't feel like going anywhere . tiny bubbles and large bubbles reside within the miniscus .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark ruby red/brown color . a towering beige head forms , and finally settles . the pillowing foam has excellent retention . sticky lace is left down the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : this beer is a dark and murky brown bodied beer with absolutely no trace of a head or carbonation . the beer almost looks like dirty muddy mop-bucket water .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : bears the sultry warmth that non-filtering/bottle-conditioning bestows . auburn with a suspended cloudy of silty and plenty of rising carbonation . a flocculent head of ivory nearly tops the glass , cresting at about 3-fingers . excellent lace hangs in frothy curtains .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : arrives at the bar with a cloudy golden color and a nice head that leaves gobs of lacing	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : produced a finger of head that did not stick around , in either the lacing or head departments despite good carbonation in the body . the beer has a bit of a cloudy look to it , and is quite a bit darker then the standard lager gold .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a murky maroon body with ruby-orange edges when held up to the light . its light beige foam retains well and leaves generous sudsing down hte sides of the tulip , maintaining a light film on the beer when all is said and done . great appearance .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : nothing too special about the appearance on this one , a warm amber hugh with carbonation bubbles persistent . the only thing off about it is it pours with nearly no head at all , maybe something other than a standard pint glass would fix this .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : straw yellow clear . nice head and lacing .	00000000000
1	appearance : a brilliantly hazy , golden-orange body capped by two fingers of off-white head that quickly fade into minimal lacing . it 's worth noting that the last pour is far hazier than the first pour .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a nice amber color with an off-white head . the beer is unfiltered so there are tiny white globs suspended in the beer .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : a huge , frothy , mocha colored cap that leaves behind huge clumps of lace sits atop a black body .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dark black body with a tan head with low retention and some lacing along the sides of the glass .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : beer poured a golden color with an orange hue , little head .	000000000000000
1	appearance : pours into a sam adams glass a deep brown to black . a one-finger tan head forms on top and drops to a large collar with an almost full bubbly surface coating .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pale cloudy straw . pours into a giant white 3 finger foamy head . settles forming little craters , foamy spiderweb lacing clings to the sides of the glass as it does .	00000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a ruddy sepia with small white head , solid retention .	00000000000000
1	a : a vigorous pour delivers a clear mahogany body with some fine particulates in suspension underneath a billowing head of frothy tan foam that fills the tulip to the perfect stage of near-overflowing . retention is off the charts , and as the head recedes it leaves the thickest covering of lace that i 've ever seen . phenomenal looking beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured a hazy golden/straw color with a large , white foamy head ballooning on top ( about 2.5 fingers thick ) . really , this beer looks every bit the part of a sexy german brew . just a bit of lacing clinging to the side of the glass as this beer quickly disappears .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark pink color with reddish hues , quite cloudy . the head is about 2 cm and has a light pink color . it settles fast and leaves small lacings . of course , this looks kind of weird judged as a witbier , but it 's actually quite good looking and since it 's brewed with fruit juice , i assume that the pink color is ok.	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : opaque black liquid ( no light will penetrate it- i tried to with a coleman max led flashlight ! )	0000000000000000000000
1	a : clear amber-orange with a thin vivid white head that stayed exactly the same for the duration . beautiful sticky lacing all over the inside of the glass . i was really impressed with the overall appearance of this beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear mahogany in the glass with ruby highlights when held against a lamp . the pour produces a light tan-colored head of two fingers ' worth , but it slowly recedes into half a finger on the brew , and leaves some flecks of lacing down the glass . really impressive for a 10 % er .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : moderate pour yields a 1 finger semi-coarse , light chocolate head that fades gradually . beer is a dark , almost opaque amber . lacing is actually pretty epic ... frothy , full , and nearly completely covering the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : 25oz bottle poured into tall weizen glass . pours a very nice golden wheat colour , darkens as everything begins to settle . inch-thick puffy head , fades with nice lacing . visible carbonation , moderate amount .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a half finger head of decent cream , okay thickness , and and bad retention . colour is a cloudy yellow . sm : light lemon ester hops and clean barley . a mild strength aroma .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : perfectly translucent amber color . head has nice volume with light beige color . head looks creamy but the retention is surprisingly good . lacing is pretty good too . very nice looking beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : beautiful . orange with pale edges . bubbly .	00000000000
