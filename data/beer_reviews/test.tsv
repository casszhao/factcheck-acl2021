1	appearance : ruddy dark brown settles with a nice looking tan colored head which struts its longevity for some time . gorgeous lacing once the head rests and lays low with a cloth carpet head . finely dissolved conditioning .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : extremely clear yellow , with almost no head at all . the bubbles ( not foam ) that did form during the pour dissipated in seconds .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours black with a single layer of coarse bubbles that dissipates quickly . lacing is very spotty and spare with no cling .	0000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a completely translucent golden brown body with a thin soapy bubble head that has very little retention . after the head dissipates it looks much like a pint of tea . not much going for it in terms of aesthetics .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : hazy , lighter side of an amber color . large , fluffy/foamy head . i can already detect alot of carbonation - swish this around and the little bubbles just stick to the sides of the glass before slowly falling back down into the liquid . ok , this is nice to look at , how does it smell ?	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a very small and thin off-white head that quickly disappears . lower level carbonation evident , which quickly ceases as well . colour is more brown than red , like a sienna with some faint hints of rust on the sides . zero film stays and no lacing . relatively lack luster , even for the style .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : the beer is a cloudy amber color . when poured , a head about a finger tall forms but almost immediately disipates .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : the instant the cap is pulled from the bottle , it is clear that this is going to be a disaster . the cork in question has a serious amount of black sludge coating it . this sight alone says to me `` bad idea dude , turn away '' . the pour starts out normal , but eventually leads to large chunks of sediment falling from the open container ( another bad sign ) . there is no carbonation and absolutely no head . the beer is black as pitch .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a thick , luxuriant , opulent tan head , eruptive and violent at the outset but quickly placated in to a finger-and-a-half of pillowy , rocky goodness . the foamy , cocoa cloud sits atop the viscous , inky black body that lets nary a wisp of light show through . carbonation is present and actually relatively quick for the style and abv % , but its sparseness belies its origin . the lacing is similarly nice , impressive for both a beer of this magnitude and particularly one that 's barrel aged , strewing soapy , spongy strings all over sides of the snifter . it actually somewhat resembles chocolate milk that 's been recently stirred and is still frothy and foamy . in fact , the retention and lacing are so remarkable i 'm going to bump this one up to a 5.0 - the stick is just truly you do n't see in a beer of this type .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured a murky dark brown with a few floaties towards the end . lively light brown head with great lacing .	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this beer had a deep ebony appearance as it sat in the glass . there were some dark caramel hints around the edges if it was held up to the light . the tan head rose up quickly to three fingers , even with an easy pour . it was course , though , and disappeared quickly , leaving a rough layer of bubbles lingering on top of the brew . the lacing was patchy at best .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : as with its organic ale sibling , the pour is impressive , with the golden liquid capped by a fluffy white head ; the retention is just average , however , and not much lacing is left behind	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a two finger head of no cream , decent thickness , and below average retention . colour is a clear yellow . sm : slight cream and plain clean barley . a very light strength aroma .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : deep black with an almost fluorescent purple head . what an incredibly unique looking beer , i 've never seen anything like it . in the light there are flecks of garnet . there is n't much lacing and the head falls flat quickly . however , the bubbles are tiny and tight , which leads me to believe the beer will be slightly creamy . i have never given an exceptional appearance before and may not for a long time .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : dark-brown/black color with a huge tan head that gradually collapses , leaving thick lacing .	00000000000000000
1	a : dark black , thick brown head that dissipates slowly .	000000000000
1	a : the pour is deep deep burgundy with a really large thick creamy off-white head . the slow dissipation leaves lacings galore .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear reddish amber color , an aggressive pour produced a decent tan head , but that falls very quickly into a scant cap with scant lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a dark red-brown color with plenty of opaque-ish ruby highlights with three fingers of cream-colored head . excellent lacing , and the head really stick around -- if not apparent by the photo ( proprietary ) . 5/5	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : dark brown with reddish highlights , slightly translucent ; ultra-thick nitro head .	000000000000000
0	a : tawny , light brown , like murky apricot juice with no head . luckily , appearances are deceiving , because this did n't look great .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a massive white head sits atop a slightly hazy golden body . the head has reasonable staying and leaves a light lacing as it slowly rescinds . classic looks and perfect presentation for a tripel .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : really cloudy , lots of sediment , washed out yellow color . looks pretty gross , actually , like swamp water . no head , no lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : nice copper in color with a nice thick head with good retention and good lacing .	000000000000000000
1	a : poured a dark clear ( filtered ) chocolatey amber color with a rich white foamy head .	0000000000000000000
1	a : pours a copper-orange color . a vigorous pour produced several fingers of foamy white head that eventually dissipated to about two fingers . lots of sticky lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : hazy and amazingly pale lemon-drop yellow body . this almost looks like lemonade as it pours out of the bottle . nice finger and a half of white head that recedes quickly and leaves decent lacing . great presentation .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : huh looks like a lager . 'bout like budwieser with less head . that head run 's for the hills and it 's gone in 10 seconds ...	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : three-finger head ; cloudy orange-yellow ; very nice carbonation ; sweet sheet of lacing	0000000000000000
1	appearance : dale bros. pomona queen california amber lager is an attractive , bright gold-amber color that is perfectly clear . the beer does n't form much of a head , even with a vigorous pour . swirling the glass leaves lacing on the glass which is good looking but short-lived .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours mahogany with a small off-white head , fair retention , light lace .	0000000000000000
0	a : pour generates a small ring of white head that dissipates quickly . beer is a slightly cloudy yellowish-white peach . lacing is minimal and with little stick . the 2000 vintage is surprisingly much more carbonated . more head , more lace and darker beer color overall also . still , pretty much what i 'd expect from a gueuze .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours opaque black , with about 1 & 1/2 finger head ... nice & tan . good head retention very nice lacing .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : a straight pour fills the glass perfectly with a clear medium orange-amber body and three fingers of frothy white head that just barely peek over the rim . good retention and light , sticky lace . a little lighter in color than i might like for the style , but otherwise a magnificent-looking beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : amber colored . slightly hazy . slight head	0000000000
1	a : it was copper colored with an orange tint to the body . the one finger head was off white and receded to a ring around the collar and a partial cover of the surface of the brew . the ring was sustained for some time by an aggressive carbonation and the ring produced a jagged lacing that was more entertaining than the taste of this beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a bright orange without much of a head , kind of pallid .	0000000000000000
1	appearance : beer pours a gorgeous crystal-clear ruddy amber beer with a marvelous one-and-a-half finger meringue-like head with fantastic retention . carbonation is sparse but fine-bubbled and concentrated . lacing is also pretty unbelievable on this one , falling into avant garde-esque sheets and splotches . very nice looking beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : it pours like an elixir or more accurately , like a 10w 30 motor-oil . i 'm not talking synthetic but i 'm talking about a serious bonafide thick and viscous friction free engine saver . thicker than oyster sauce and an oily pitch black . i mean you can shine a high power surefire flashlight directly in front of this stuff and you 're not getting a spec of light through it .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : unfortunately , the nose lowers my expectations considerably . lightly roasted malts , fudge , and coffee are there , but the aroma is pitifully weak . even more concerning is that same weird sourness/funkiness that i first smelled in bayhawk ales chocolate porter ( see review ) that is not at all pleasant .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dark honey amber with a touch of fizzy head that quickly vanished into nothing . no head , no lace .	0000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : not the best looking beer out there , 1 finger of head that dissapates rather quickly , yellowish color almost reminds me of a miller lite .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : light yellow in color with a large soapy head that stays around the whole time . the head on this beer is remarkable and deserves recognition . a slew of little bubbles rising through the beer . at first the beer was fairly clear but later i swirled some yeast in and the beer became cloudy .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a half one finger head that is ivory and is creamy . the head has poor retention . the color of the beer is a dark brown with copper red hues . the clarity of the beer is hazy to opaque . there is some carbonation bubbles in the beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : ugh . thin , sickly yellow with minimal head . no lacing .	000000000000000
1	a : pours a decent looking amber color that is slightly hazy with a medium amount of carbonation bubbles and about two fingers worth of head that is very fine and is a light tan color that lingers nicely , leaves a decent amount of lacing on the glass	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : shakespeare stout pours out nearly black with a full 3 fingers of mocha colored head . retention is very good , and lacing is very abundant .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a light yellow with a thin stark white head and not a lot of retention . not much lacking , either .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear pale yellow with a small amount of white head . most of it dissipates , but a thin film does leave a bit of lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours just as the name states a golden color with 1 finger width white head and really no lacing down the glass .	0000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours into an allagash tulip a slightly hazy pale gold with a huge , fluffy , white , large-bubbled head . an insane stream of bubbles rockets up through the beer keeping the head constantly refreshed . lacing comes in sheets and chunks the entire way down the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : practically still black body - just a tiny scattering of bubbles around the rim . only the slightest glint of orange-brown at the extremities when held up to light . no lace , but nice legs .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : can looks like some sort of cheap soda . pouring it into a small cup it 's a bright clear pale .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : well the appearance is about as nice as they come . you get the beautiful nitrogen show and then it settles with a dark brown , almost black , body with a nice light tan head .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours dark black , looks thick , very thin head on all glasses poured .	00000000000000000
0	a : grape soda .	00000
0	a : the beer is a very pale yellow color , with a thin white head that fades very quickly and leaves almost no lace on the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : brown bottle , pours crystal clear pale orange-yellow with effervescent carbonation and a thin white head that leaves the odd bit of lace .	00000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours dark brown , but is clear with ruby highlights when held to light . off white head of about one finger never completely fades , and the lace curtains you get from sipping leave sticky spots on the glass . looks really good .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pale yellow , no carb beads , no head , flat as pita bread	0000000000000000
1	appearance : mostly clear but slightly dulled yellow with surprisingly substantial foamy head and lots of lacing .	000000000000000000
1	a : one finger head that retains well , little lacing , cloudy yellow color , lots of bubbles . yeast at bottom of bottle .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy , pale straw color . poured a 2 finger white head that dissipated to skim around the inside edge of the glass . no lacing on the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : it just does not get much better than the look of this stuff in a pint glass . jet black ... amazing tan head .	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this one is amazingly photogenic . looks like a perfect ris : pitch black with barely no brown around the edges , even when held up to a bright light . an incredibly creamy , frothy and sticky dark khaki head forms and sticks around for quite a bit . impeccable .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : as expected , a very clear golden hue . the head was a little less than a half-inch deep and was filled with disproportionately-sized balls of air sitting in a sea of smaller , white bubbles . the head was gone in two minutes .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : the cap almost popped off the bottle because there was so much pressure . the head was more of a soda/ice cream float style carbonation that did really stay . there was still a slight caramel head over a dark coffee body .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : bottle opens with a 'gunshot pop '' and pours a dark black with a monstrous 2.5 '' dark tan head . fantastic retention . no faults here ...	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured with about 1/4 '' of white head . nicoco says it 's `` look kinda like dehydrated piss yellow . '' fair enough , i can agree with that . it 's hazy . head does n't have too much retention , lacing fades quickly .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pale golden with some haze that dissipated quickly . no lacing from the thin but tightly bulbed head .	000000000000000000000
0	a : the pour is a shockingly bright yellow color , almost neon , with a white head .	0000000000000000000
0	a : served from a 12 bottle into a surly pint glass . pours a dark brown almost black with very minimal thin head	000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : just like the bottle , the beer itself is gorgeous . a deep , orange-ish , gold color with a nice thick , foamy head . the foamy head , of course , led to a nice , think lacing as well .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : it pours pitch black with no head whatsoever . it looks like a flat coke .	000000000000000000
0	a : pours a pale yellow with floaties . the floaties could be from the slice of orange that came in the glass . no head with no retention and no lace . pretty bland looking .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear golden color with two fingers of creamy white head that fades slowly , leaving countless strips of lacing on the glass .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : very thin head that quickly disappears , this beer looks and sounds like apple-cider , only with less carbonation . not very impressive .	00000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : clear ruby-brown , 2 finger soda-y head , nice retention and excellent lacing .	0000000000000000
1	appearance : golden yellow , poured with about three fingers of dense white foam . retention was excellent , left lots of lacing . lots of bubbles .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dark amber with a soft white head , average retention , no lace .	000000000000000000
0	a : corked and caged . the beer peers out from the bottle slightly reddish in color , which is somewhat surprising . after popping the cork , the beer overflowed and foamed ( with no end in sight ! ) until i was able to get some of it into a glass . * i 'm not all that familiar with french culture - maybe this is the brasserie la choulette 's idea of a gift . this bire de garde is a brownish amber , contrary to how it looked in the bottle . low clarity , and a huge , three-finger , rocky , sandstone head . after the head finally subsides , a thick layer of cream persists atop the beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this brew pours with a wonderfully thick head . sustain is excellent . lacings are plentiful and surface spiderwebbing is consistant and lasting . color is indeed a reddish amber . excellent first impression .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear amber color with a finger of white head . solid looking beer .	000000000000000000
0	a : color is nice : an autumnal chestnut/orange-brown , a faint haze . where 's the carbonation ? a few frothy soap bubbles form a sloppy ring , fading quickly to pencil-thin whitish ring . no visible bubbles - looks kinda sad and lifeless but for a cheery color .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : muted , but pretty , apricot pour , very cloudy . 1 finger head , decent retention . prefect lacing . thick , sticky , blankety , rings , everything ... just as good as furious ' .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a beautiful clear scarlet red with bright kool-aid red highlights in a tulip glass . head was a half inch off white , but dropped to a ring around the glass fairly quickly . lotsa bubbles . color is beautiful .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy bright amber-gold body with a thin , late developing head that leaves as soon as it arrives . definitely a bit on the flat side for a saison .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : odd carbonation . not very beer like . more like a sparkling apple juice . color is a somewhat dull gold . no head .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured into a pint glass . if this were actually a golden ale ( or a pilsner , for that matter ) , i 'd grade it higher , but damned it if does n't taste every bit like a pale ale , and the wimpy head and fizzy yellow color do not match .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : huge head of foam with lively carbonation . light amber in color . 1.5 inch off-white foam that leaves some lacing .	000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : it had a nice , deep amber colored body with good clarity . the head was creamy white in color and thin . it faded fast leaving just a ring of bubbles on top of the body .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : rich amber color , nice and clear , with a thick foamy white head about half an inch thick that retains well . plenty of carbonation rises from the bottom of the glass as well .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear golden body . thin white head . decent retention with little lacing .	0000000000000000
0	a : pours a dull straw yellow color . a small bubbly white head forms and leaves little lace .	00000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark , night-sky black . small khaki-colored head that goes away rather fast , leaving no lace .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : beautiful beer ! it 's a perfectly clear light amber color topped by a big-bubble , thin but foamy head . lacing is alright , but the beer looks so good it makes up for that in other areas .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this sour brown ale , true to its name , pours deep ruby-tinted brown , with a quickly-vanishing two-finger head that is also a rich burnt-straw-brown mahogany .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a two finger thick tight bubbly dark tan head with very good retention . jet black body with minimal carbonation . head slowly fades to a good foam cap and leaves some nice lacing right away . a thin film remains until the end leaving some good looking lacing down the sides . a nice beer to look at .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark amber , copper colored..very clear . small tan head that fades quicly . absolutley no head or film . wonderful color and clarity , but the lack of head/lacing/film dissapoints me .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a translucent and effervescent golden , capped by a half finger of white foam . the head dissipates quickly , leaving some scant bubbles and lacing across the top of the beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : the beer is a nebulous orangeish brown with a small bubbly head . not much else to report on the appearance . you now have ample information .	000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : a new penny copper , with about a finger high head of white ... retention is poor , receding quickly to a little lip of lace ringing around the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this pours pitch black . a large tan head ( over two fingers forms ) with great retention . as the foam gently recedes , sticky spiderweb looking lace is left all the way down my snifter .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : black , opaque , with dense creamy tan head	00000000000
1	a : this is a very beautiful looking beer . the head is absolutely amazing , with perfect color and form . it laces like cream on the glass . the color is a very dark brown or black , depending on how much light is on it .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : nice amber , with thick white head reduced and laced nicely .	00000000000000
0	a : pours a nice red color with a tiny bubbly head that quickly runs and hides . no lacing at all .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a lovely , clear reddish-amber body with three fingers of soft , pillowy cream-colored foam . terrific retention and lots of lace . stunning .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a super large 3+ finger thinner off-white head . no real carbonation evident . colour is a lighter brown , perhaps sienna or russet . actually poured relatively clear for a dunkelweizen , then quickly turned cloudy after a few seconds . head quickly dissipates into a film cap , which stays the entire time , and leaves some good lacing down the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : cloudy , hazy gold , full white head . looks like a witbier . nice representation of the style .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : poured an opaque mahogany color with ruby / orange highlights when held to a lamp . i dumped it into a 1l mug , and the off-white head was literally half the mug with even a careful pouring technique . took 10+ minutes to recede into a drinkable half-fingers ' worth of head , which remained steady throughout the drink . left substantial lacing down the glass . unbeatable appearance .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dark red , almost no carbonation and head .	00000000000
0	a : dark , opaque looking . very little tan head that quickly dissipated . i am new to drinking porters so i 'm not sure if a frothy head is to be expected .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : nothing exceptional about the over-all appearance . translucent , medium amber .	00000000000000
1	a : copper bronze , some off-white head , lots of lace .	0000000000000
1	a : light orange color with the most insane head i 've ever seen . off white and very very creamy head . lasts a long time with lots of lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a fizzy yellow pour with a white head that does not retain in the slightest bit . i 'm pretty sure the water bloated pepper winked back at me .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : clear coppery color with a rich thick white foam . plenty of persistent lacing on the glass as i drank it down , but the foam on top does eventually go to just a thin film .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : super light water color with some yellow thrown in . minimal white head . no lacing .	0000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear orange with a one finger white head .	0000000000000
0	a : black color . an aggressive pour yielded barely one finger of light brown head that fell pretty quickly , but did leave a bit of lacing behind . 5.0	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a very dark and ominous jet-black coffee color with a finger of brownish head . good lacing , poor head retention .	0000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a light to medium orange , with a soft soapy white head . full concentric rings of lace and very good retention are a highlight .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dirty straw , pours with a white head , absolutely no retention or lacing .	00000000000000000
1	appearance : rich , hazy medium orange hue with lots of apparent effervescence . head poured three thick fingers of pillowy ivory foam . pretty good in my book .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a hazy dark copper/amber with orange hues . beautiful off-white head that clings moderately to the glass .	000000000000000000000
1	a : significant cream-colored head . beer itself is chocolate milk-colored . the cascading waterfall effect is very cool .	00000000000000000000
1	a : pours a thick tan head that quickly fades . beautiful jet-black color .	000000000000000
0	a : a hazy orange color . me thinks this is bottle conditioned given all the haze.. nice white head , that dissipates into a white ring .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : it 's strange how this style looks so identical in almost every way . i suppose that the same could be said for most any style , though . honestly , though , this one almost looks a little brighter than some others ... in some ways , it is kinda true to urine . quick forming head , just as quick to disappear .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : always love the look of a good nitro-poured stout . a bit of translucent dark ruby around the edges .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : very dark , as the name would suggest ... but some brown tinge . quite a nice head , with moderate retention and nice lace .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a hazy light orange with a small off-white head with poor retention and no lacing .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : from the outset i am suspicious of this alleged lager because it doesnt have any other adjectives akin to lagers and it looks as reluctant as a craigslist casual encounters endeavor . it is just languid and sits there , supplicant but distasteful . it is deep yellow , mellow gold and the carbonation looks like a crestfallen 8th birthday party with lacing streamers applied with judicious alacrity .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : considerably hazy , very dark golden body with a 1/5-inch-high white head .	000000000000000
1	appearance : extremely voluptuous head , almost overflowing , with lots of carbonation and bubbles . over one finger of head , with great retention . great temperature too ! ( some casks at pony are at times too cold ) . head and bubbles stay on and on . color is pitch black , no nuances there .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a very dark brown with a billowing fluffy dark tan-ish brown oily head that slowly faded into a thick film leaving a network of sticky lace .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : little carbonation ; minimal head ; clear , solid yellow	000000000000
0	a : the initial pour into my weizen glass was almost 100 % foam , so i switched over to nonic . when the head settled , i had a nice lemon-glow hazy weizenbock .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the body is dark , murky & pruney-brown colored with a small bubbly head , light brown in color . it made an appearance and then , all at once , took off like it stole something . interesting to say the least but i 'm not at all impressed at this point .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : pours a crystal clear golden color . has a medium sized white head that quickly settles to a film quickly . i notice lots of suspeneded sediment in my glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : amber , clear , foam is medium .	0000000000
1	a : light yellow body , foaming white head that subsided quickly . not much lacing but a welcoming color . clarity is brilliant - i could mistake this for a watered down generic lager based on looks but that would be a fantastic mistake . re-pours were overwhelmingly heady , perhaps because of temperature .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : oddly difficult to tell it 's pink , with its murky amber tone and orangey-rose tint	000000000000000000
1	appearance : deep , rich , amber red . poured semi-aggressively to yield 2 fingers of nice , tan , creamy head which started to reveal some interesting pitting after a bit . moderate lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours sub pale straw beer with a little active carbonation and a bright white head . the head actually does n't look that bad , really textured and firm on top . very clear .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy light straw color . a large amount of frothy white head that leaves sticky but bubbly lacing . medium carbonation .	000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : i did n't pour it into a glass , we just passed the can around , taking sips . but after just a handful of sips , this stuff was so absolutely vile that we poured it down the drain . as the noxious fluid began to glug out of the can , i noticed it was a pale pinkish color at first , and then the color rapidly darkened . right before the can emptied , the color had darkened to a light red . as if the taste was n't god-awful , the color and appearance were also nasty . it looked like the stuff separated inside the can , with watery stuff on top , and tomato gook settling on the bottom . it appeared like you either needed to shake the beer in the can ( which is completely counterintuitive ) , or pour it into a glass and then mix it with a swizzle stick . ugh !	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a light amber colour with a white head diminishing quickly to a thin ring .	000000000000000000
0	a : golden hazy , and choc full of sediment . this is the second variety i 've had from this brewery in the 12oz bottle that i 've had trouble keeping the sediment out of my glass . so , my perception of color maybe off from loads of sediment suspended throughout my glass . the head is fluffy , nice retention , and leaves lacey legs on the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : bright , golden macro-yellow . huge , audible bubbles . volatile white head struggles to establish itself , then dissipates very quickly .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : black as night . gorgeous finger-and-a-half dark brown head that leaves a nice full cap throughout consumption .	00000000000000000000
1	a : very dark , clear when held to the light with red and orange highlights .	00000000000000000
1	a : pours a light golden with a couple fingers of dense white head that reduced very slowly into a thick frothy head . beautiful rings/sheets of lacing left with every sip .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : this beer pours a very murky , very hazy amber-orange color . there was a ton of yeast floating around in the brew . a rough , almost white head rose up to two fingers with some coaxing and settled back quickly , leaving a thin cap of foam . this , too , has disappeared well before the beer was gone . there was no lace left to speak of .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : it poured a translucent amber color with a small white head with poor retention and no lace .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : nasty ! sludgy brown , explosive diarrhea , with a couple of bubbles . at least it did n't have any protein chunks , it would have scored even lower ! it reminds me of every time i go to the states and eat american junkfood , taco bell for instance , i always get the runs , like my body rejects it and decides to give my colon a backwash as punishment . that 's why i stick to places like whole foods , although the attraction is just too great and i always end up caving in ! anyways , you get my point , back to the beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : pale orange golden with a slight chill haze . wispy white lace lays on top .	000000000000000000

0	a : cloudy , yeasty dull orange color . nice head .	000000000000

1	appearance : long lasting sticky white head leaves thick lacing on my glass . this porter is lighter in color than some others , or maybe the others are too dark . hold it up to the light and it is a clear dark red or brown .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : greenish yellow , due to herb syrup . smooth head is lime green ( looks like lime jello salad ) . not too appetizing . spotting lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pretty bottle , but it 's uh-oh on the pour : uninspiring pale gold color of some unloveable lagers and ( within a few seconds ) no head to speak of . are they trying to make it look like the nitrogenous waste of quadruped mammals ?	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a murky , cloudy reddish/brown color . a minimal tan head forms , but recedes to nothing in a second . light lace is left behind .	000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pale straw colored .	000000

0	a : this is where this beer shines . very strong citrous and floral aroma . strong centennial and amarillo hop aroma . hop heads will really enjoy the aroma of this beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : looks ... like a pale lager . head puffs up nicely to start with , but five minutes later it 's as if it was never there . great carbonation level , though - looks refreshing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : slightly hazy , ruby-amber pour with a voluminous ( and tenacious ) , light-tan whipped-cream head . recedes to floating dollops ... lace everywhere !	000000000000000000000000000

1	a : standard pour yields a .25 dark mocha head with great retention . beer is a dark , opaque , motor oil black . lacing is spotty and stringy with decent cling and thick , oily legs . a masterpiece considering how heavy it looks .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this beer pours dark as motor oil . nice . with a good 3 finger head and great retention . it maintains its frothy coating throughout the duration of the beer . good lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured with a huge fluffy white head that lasted forever . the beer is a clear golden color with a few bubbles rising , but the head sticks around anyway . there is a whole bunch of lacing left on the glass after the head falls .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a deep brown , nearly black . 1/4 '' dark tan head fades quickly to a film . tiny carbonation bubbles rise rapidly . minimal lacing on the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a near clear , copper-amber body with a finger of pearl foam . small flecklets of lace on the way down .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : when i first poured this out of the can i thought it was motor oil . there is a brown head that is about 1 finger tall .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : lots of debris floating around in the beer . i know this is unfiltered beer , but the amount of junk in the beer is imo out of line .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the beer is clear brownish amber in color and has a high amount of carbonation . it poured with a two finger high beige head that has excellent retention properties .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : the clarity of this batch is way , way off . it pours a turbid golden-orange , like a glass of raw apple cider or chai tea .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a reddish cloudy dark amber . looks rather murky with no head to speak of .	0000000000000000000
0	a : golden amber hue with virtually no head and scant lacing .	0000000000000
0	appearance : quick head collapsed onto a thick golden clear glass never to lace or be seen again . flavor : sourdough malty base supports nice peppery ( saaz ? im thinking noble ) hops . the malt gives almost a helles bock flavor , but the hops are much stronger than that .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : light yellow , almost hay colored , hazy . 1 1/2 inch fluffy white head , leaves tons of lacing , almost completely covering the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the initial pour is jet black with a dense , compact beige head . the appearance is misleading , however , as the beer proves itself to be garnet in hue when held up to the light . as can be expected of most quadruples , the lacing is great . really , this is just a great looking beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : vigorous pour results in only half an inch of frothy off-white head atop a hazy red-brown body . mediocre retention and light lace . quite boring .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours an extremely dark , clear , mahogany reddish-brown with a couple finger of thick light tan head that faded into a thick film . a great network of lacing was left down the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : the beer pours a deep amber red color with a thin off-white head that does not last . i do n't think i have ever had a beer poured at the ale house that did have a nice head though .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : thick creamy head that lasted until the beer was finished . dark dark brown in color similar to almost all stouts .	000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very effervescent . poured a absolutely clear golden yellow , very small off white head .	000000000000000000
1	appearance : big pillowy off-white head . minimal lacing . burnt orange color . very clear . flavor : getting a lot of floral hops off of this , unusual for an oktoberfest . bready , very slightly toasted . sweet medium-caramel flavor stays on the tongue and lips . clean and crisp . a little bit of sulfur from aroma .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this was a clear , dark chestnut brown with lighter golden edges . it poured with a big , long lasting , and super stiff foamy cap .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : another victory for victory . this is a delicious looking beer ! dark with a creamy , full head . nice .	000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a thicker looking two finger off-white head with good retention . clear with medium carbonation evident . burnt umber brown or mahogany red in color . head slowly fades to a decent film leaving some immediate lacing on the glass . a good film remains until the end and leaves some nice lacing down the sides of the glass . good looking beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours light golden with lots of both small and large bubbles in the liquid . the soapy white head sinks quickly into very poor lacings .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very clear bright yellow but no real head to speak of and no lace . flavor : a nice pils profile . the bready smell translated into a nice nutty taste with a clean finish . a generous dose of hops keeps it light and crisp .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a very cloudy sort of golden straw pour . ridiculous foamy head that lasts for an easy 10 minutes . lacing is great too . there was so much foam i had to pour it in 3 phases into my tulip . so much that the bottle sprayed beer everywhere when i uncorked it in fact . 15 minutes after i poured it , it 's still slowly foaming out of the bottle .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : standard pour yields a 1.5 finger frothy white head with good retention . beer is a cloudy peach with an orange tint . lacing is stringy and spotty with very good cling . lacing and head are nice but clarity hurts this one a bit .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : very dark with a thick foam head with good retention . a little light comes through at the bottom . very good lacing .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : after the wax is cut away the cap pops with the absolute loudest sound i 've ever heard come from a non-corked beer 's opening , and a slow upwelling of foam begins to overflow into a hastily-provided glass . once actual beer starts coming out , it 's visibly chunky with particulates ; every pour from first to last comes complete with a host of solid matter . my particular pour has a dark-brown body playing host to a galaxy of black particulates , topped by a soapy head that quickly recedes to a spotty ring . foul .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : brilliant copper . huge creamy white head like a cloud in the sky that lasted a half an inch till the last drop . racing carbonation bubbles . flavor : sweet maltiness followed by a huge alcohol flavor mixed with an earthy/spicy bitterness . very dry finish . slight hint of vegetal ( cooked vegetable is an off-flavor described best as cooked corn , cabbage or broccoli . it is caused by low levels of sulfur-based compounds primarily perceived in aroma and to a lesser extent in flavor . primary source is from malt ) .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours out an opaque jet black with 3+ fingers of light creamed coffee colored head . head is very dense and takes forever to dissipate down to a 1 fingers width that hangs around for the rest of the drink and leaves massive , heavy lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear pale yellow body . a lot of carbonation rising in the glass . white foamy head dissipated over a few minutes .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : golden-bronze with a white head , very little retention , no lacing ( where 's the wheat protein ? ) .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : poured a deep copperish color with good carbonation and a small white head . looked pretty bad , low on carbonation	00000000000000000000000
1	a : nice , clear golden color . very foamy and lasting head with some small lacing .	000000000000000000
0	a : semi-vigorous pour creates a coarse 1 finger white head that dissipates quickly . brew is semi-clear orange-amber . lacing is spotty and with no real cling .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : very dark brown color that does n't allow you to see through . it has a nice soapy tan head .	00000000000000000000000
0	appearance : free pour yields a one inch head that dissipates quickly leaving no lacing . pours a completely translucent , disconcertingly bright orange . maybe this would be desirable if you 're really into the pumpkin conceit , but for me it 's a little off-putting . leaves occasional swatches of short-lived lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : nearly black in color , a very dark cola color with a thick , foamy cocoa head . great retention and lacing .	0000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : bright yellow with thin head and minimal lacing ; i can read the paper through it	000000000000000000
1	a : big time caramel mocha colored head . outstanding lacing . deep dark brown and charred red . looks amazing .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this may be the singularly best looking beer i have ever seen in a glass . the beer poured a clear golden coloration . the head was very tall and proud with an off white coloration . the retention was perfect throughout the consumption of the beer . the carbonation was explosive rolling boiling bubbles . bits of lace remained on the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : amber , like the style . half finger head , sub par lacing .	0000000000000000
0	appearance : clear golden with a one-finger white head . good lacing . not a bad appearance , but i prefer more haziness in this kind of beer .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : kinda weak head . no pop to it .	00000000000
0	appearance : deep dark brown , opaque , very little head	00000000000
1	a : slight deep amber coloring , nice lingering head and lacing . very high carbonation apparent . really nice looking brew .	00000000000000000000000
0	appearance : like phosphorescent piss . not much head . yuck	00000000000
1	appearance : pours a clear , brilliant amber body with a creamy ivory-colored head . gooey latticework of lacing .	00000000000000000000
1	a : bright light golden with a thin layer of head on top .	00000000000000
0	a : slightly hazy gold with low head .	000000000
0	a : one finger head of slight cream , fair thickness , and poor retention . slightly cloudy semitransparent pale yellow colour . unappealing . sm : heavy on the souring hops , light on some fringe esters , but not berry . a moderate strength scent all around . appealing but atypical for the region .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours black with a medium mocha coloured head . good retention , light lace .	00000000000000000
1	a : light straw yellow . plenty of carbonation , bone white head with medium to heavy lacing .	0000000000000000000
1	a : poured perfectly . nice pinkish , beige head with a good retention and very good lacing for this style . thicker looking than other fruity beers for sure .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : nothing to write home about . light lacing , amber-gold in color . medium level of carbonation .	00000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dark golden color with virtually no head . it creates large bubbles that are clear giving it more of the appearance of swamp water froth rather than head . not to pleasing . nothing spectacular about it one way or the other . actually this is a pretty ugly beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : straw yellow would be putting it nicely . a very short lasting soft drink like head .	0000000000000000000
0	a : pours a rather hazy , blonde yellowish colour . disturbing the settled yeast added a good amount of sediment to the pour . fortunately , i do n't mind the yeasty flavours . a rather short head tops it , but it was a little chilly to begin with , so that is n't a surprise .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark orange to amber in color , ring of head with nice sticky lacing .	00000000000000000
1	appearance : darkest , thickest brown head i 've seen , even a notch above rogue 's shakespeare stout . pitch black even when directly on top of a 60w lamp . tall head , intense lacing . continues to thicken as the head slowly dissipates . flavor : anise , sweet molasses , oakey , roasty , some alcohol and licorice at the end . a bit of bitterness , mostly associated with the licorice . the aftertaste is of anise and sweet , warm molasses .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : very dark brown , almost black body with a superficial tanned coffee head that dissipated quick . no lacing present .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : golden amber/orange color with a thick off-white head . lots of sediment even with a careful pour . head never really fully settles . lots of sticky lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : beautiful lacing on the glass sides from the light tan head which phases between dirty white and a creamy vanilla yellow depending on the angle of the incandescent light . scrumptious ruddy body that is clear , despite the thick layer of yeast visible on the bottom of the bottle , which remained undisturbed by the single pour . head retention is superb and the conditioning is excellent too . a good start then ? ...	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this pours a lovely cloudy golden/orange color . a huge foamy head forms and leaves tons of sticky lace down my snifter .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : no head ; cloudy pale yellow ; ok carb action	000000000000
1	a : it looks dark , just like coffee with some redish . i like the color , since it remind me of red wines .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : midnight black , with garnet hues near the bottom edge if held up to light . moderate bubbly chocolately tan head that quickly shrinks	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : beer is a semi-clear mahogany . no head , no lacing , no carbonation . i understand that this is an `` extreme '' beer , but reviewing to style , i ca n't give it a good score with no head or lacing grade .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : served with a lemon ... murky and muddy , reminded me of restaurant kitchen mop water ... hazy and sloppy	0000000000000000000000
0	a : a dark beer with a bit of a red tint towards the bottom . there is very little head on this beer ; the head leaves rather quickly . there appears to be a slight bit of carbonation	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : deep solid golden yellow brew , 3 '' of billowy off-white head sticks around and coats the glass with webbing . moderate carbonation visible . quite appealing .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a nice , dark red . the color of ripe cherries ... and blood .	000000000000000000
1	a : black color . one finger tan head with good retention and lacing .	000000000000000
1	a : a clear light copper bear with a nice foamy creamy white head . the nitrogen really adds to the appearance .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : guinness just looks great in the glass . good contrast with black color with a creamy white head .	000000000000000000000
1	a : crystal clear , slight yellow hue . tons of fluffy , white head , decent retention . the lace really looks like lace !	00000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : golden color , cloudy with a white head that has tiny bubbles giving it an appearance of a really creamy head . it is a beautiful beer to look at . there is a high amount of co2 that is releasing from the beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : murky mahogany with no carbonation . looks legitimately bad and flat .	00000000000000
1	appearance : the body is a deep black color . the head is a velvety light tan color , small bubbles , two or three inches tall , excellent retention as well and lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a light golden yellow with a one finger white head . leaves a really nice lacing . 4.5	000000000000000000000
1	a : creamy tan head is light and pleasant but suffers from poor retention . dark brown body with an amber hue showing when held up to the light .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : reddish in color with a finger of beige lacing	00000000000
1	appearance : very dark brown with a thick , creamy , light tan head with excellent retention and fabulous rings of lacing . the cascade is a thing of beauty !	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : what a great looking stout . deep brown color with an extremly silkey 1/2 '' head that slowly disipates into lacing	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : nice easy lacing with a light head , lively , golden color .	000000000000000
0	a : pours a pitch black ( of course ) with a half-inch of tan-colored head . retention is approximately 30 seconds , as it snap-crackle-pops down into a very thin collar and a light swirl of bubbles on top of the brew . the label boasts that the head is `` thick '' and `` long-lasting , '' which is amusing to read as it is contradicted before my very eyes , but i wo n't be too much of a smartass . not much lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark cloudy copper body with two fingers of off white head . good retention and lacing .	0000000000000000000
1	a : pours a viscous , heavy .25 finger mocha head that dissipates as quickly as it rises . no retention . beer is an appropriate , motor oil-black . lacing is patchy and with good stick .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a deep , ruby-brown body with excellent clarity and a tall , foaming , sand dollar-colored head .	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours orange in color with a huge fluffy white head that stays around for some time . lots of bubbles floating to the top .	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : about average . dark to coppery .	000000000
1	a : a sturdy clean white head splays out across the deep amber body . thick lacing coats the edge of the glass , and the retention is o 's firm that the silky smooth surface remains in place for the full experience . expectations of superb carbonation and luxurious makes follow .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : aggressive pour yields 2/3 finger of off-white head which quickly subsides to a ring of thick lace . clear dark brownish-red ( mahogany as the bottle claims - i stand corrected ) .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dark brown with ruby highlights . a small beige head forms and recedes to a ring in an instant . not much lace to speak of .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : medium yellow color with a smaller head of whtie foam . minor notes of lace .	000000000000000000
0	a : pours black with a rather thin and fizzy dark brown head that left little lacing .	000000000000000000
1	a : golden yellow pour , topped with a cumulonimbus cloud of head . insanely sticky , a spectacular pour .	000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dark , dark brown with ruby red highlights . the quarter inch head lasted about 30 seconds , then poof , it 's gone . wtf . no lacing whatsoever . smells : like coffee , chocolate , and maybe a little toffee .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : half finger head is quite thin ( a victim of camra 's blanket support of some appallingly unfounded inherent superiority of casking ) , devoid of cream , and of merely average retention . colour is a semitransparent copper . sm : cream and slight ester hops are all me broken nose picks up . all apologies , lads .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : excellent dark red color . very bright and enticing . nice head . good lacing .	000000000000000000
1	appearance : if you took iced tea , dumped about a half-cup of cherry syrup into it , took a photo of it , and blasted the saturation up , you 'd have an idea what this looks like . it looks like the queen soundtrack from that flash gordon movie sounds , but with way less head .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : the beer looks fine , kind of a nondescript amber-yellow color , maybe a little darker than your average macro lager . the sight of the pepper , which is a drab , mottled olive hue , is a little off-putting , but then part of the fun of this beer is watching people 's facial expressions when they ask , `` what the hell is that floating in there ? ''	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : very good . the beer pours with a pillowy white head and produces above-average lacing . the colour is an appealing orange-amber .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : transparent dull gold , zero carbonation and just a little fuzz for a head .	00000000000000000
1	a : poured from bottle into a pilsner glass . the head is fair and stays around for a long time . very effervescent , the bubbles just keep coming . color is a light straw color , clear as a bell - no detectable chill haze .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours an incredibly rich , thick molasses/mahogany . a deep tan head rises thick and rocky , and then lasts forever . thick lacing throughout the pint . you 'll be hard pressed to find a better looking beer than this .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : brown & hazy in my snifter . no traces of head or lace . i know it 's common for imperial brews to prove lackluster in these departments due to the higher abv , but this is supposed to be a witbier !	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : fantastic dark ale , glows slightly ruby when held up against the light . one of the best heads i 've seen - 1.5cm thick , creamy and slightly off-white . good retention and lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a bright golden colour , with a somewhat fizzy white head which has surprisingly good retention and leaves some nice belgian lacing .	00000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : the appearance of this beer was promising . light cloudy yellow color with a nice full head .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : what appearance , looks like water with some carbonated foam on it .	000000000000000
1	appearance : cork emerged with out any hiss , and a stale aroma . not an auspicious start . a hard pour does , however , yield a whirlwind of carbonation in this golden pale straw brew that is topped by an inch of pillowy tan head .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy , orange , no head .	000000000
0	a : pale yellow , translucent . very little foam on top .	0000000000000
0	a : quarter finger head , dark amber color typical of viennas .	0000000000000
0	appearance : a crystal clear amber the leans towards brown when not in the light that had a body that boasts excellent carbonation . however , after the pour not even a half finger of head and no retention whatsoever is a bit of a downer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark brown beer with a very small layer of tan head that rapidly dissipates . small flecks of floaties are evident in the beer ... not a pretty sight .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours an amber/golden color without much head , a little lighter than i had initially expected ,	0000000000000000000
0	a : pitch black color , no head , no lacing	00000000000
1	a : holy fucking head . served in a english pub glass with about three huge fingers of creamy , tan head that was n't going anywhere . after about ten minutes , the head only reduced to about 2 fingers , enough for me to give this beer a taste . jet black in color . fully opaque .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : chestnut brown , thin ring of head , no retention or lacing .	000000000000000
1	a : well this is my first dark triple therefore was very dark for a triple	0000000000000000
0	a : deep dark brown body with absolutely no head , no active looking carbonation . still as night . i was prefaced with the expectation that the body is fairly flat , so all things considered this is what i 'd expect it to look like . boring nonetheless .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : thin , fizzy head that quickly dissipates to nothing . poured a transparent honey-like color , not too appealing for a start .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : looks good , like root beer but with a foam that looks more alive . two finger dark soda head , this in turn crowns a jet black beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a deep mahogany color that looks thick . pours with very thick white head and leaves considerable lacing	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : gorgeous beer with strong lacing throughout the entire glass . the color is a crystal clear , copper and a thin , but nice and foamy head rests on top .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : robust head with a cloudy golden body .	0000000000
1	a : clear copper color . the pour dropped a two finger head that faded to a thin collar . nice lacing .	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this `` holy brew of antioch '' poured quite well leaving a thick head that sustained quite well . lacing is generous and adheres to both the glass and spiderwebs on the surface . brew color is a medium amber . excellent so far ...	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a still dark cola brown . got a 'ffft ' when i opened it , but mostly this just sits in the glass kind of lifeless . a tiny wafer of dark khaki foam retains for about 5 seconds before settling into the thinnest collar i 've seen in a long while . lacing is a non-issue .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : this beer purs a very light gold color with a white head that thins quickly like a balding man 's head .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured a cola-like head that dissipated nearly immediately , leaving a light ring around the glass . very dark brown , but not quite black , and transparent against the light . the color is correct for the style , but the lack of any head is a shame .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : amber/orange in color - almost like a very dark apple cider color . hazy/cloudy . no head / no lacing .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : the beer is a deep dark brown color , with a large brown head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear , bright copper body with an inch of fine , creamy tan foam . great retention , light lace . gorgeous .	000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a slightly cloudy copper-brown body capped by a finger of off-white head that burns out quickly and leaves no lacing .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : ruby red / crimson color . clear . reminds me of cognac . gorgeous , classy looking beer .	000000000000000000000
0	a : looks like corn colored carbonated water . white head with some lacing .	000000000000000
0	appearance : burgundy amber orange body , clear as a sunrise with a sad , fizzy beige head that hardly lasts long enough even to describe it .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : majestic three finger white head that eventually fell to 1/4 '' , leaving plenty of lacing . however , it had a weak looking , hazy , pale golden body .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured pitch black with a very thin head that immediately collapsed into a thin ring around the edge of the snifter . very little lacing ; none , really . not surprising for the style , but not a particularly pretty beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : firm pour produced a finger of tan head that dropped quickly to a thin cover . glass is very clear but dark roasted ruby showing active carbonation streams . flavor : very mild . only a slight touch of heat gives the alcohol content away , otherwise its well hidden . main taste is a cocoa with a slightly papery sweet light malt base .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : the head was extremely thin and then it vanished within seconds . this poured a cloudy yellow almost with a shade of lime . it 's different , but with its quickly vanished head it simply does seem inviting .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a medium viscous piss yellow color . for some reason i thought this was going to be much darker . big 2 finger head , with medium lacing . head retention is piss poor and goes away in 15 seconds .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : opaque black body with ( surprise surprise ) zero bubbles . no carbonation at all . come on .	000000000000000000000
0	a : copper color with a small qite head that quickly disappears . nothing special .	0000000000000000
0	a : pours a cloudy light gold . head starts off large but soon turns to nothing . not much lacing going on either .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : milky brown , tan puffy head . nice lacing .	000000000000
1	a : pale straw , great carbonation , crystal clear , and a lovely full head .	00000000000000000
1	appearance : dark , dark brown with a really foamy light tan head . not particularly good lacing , but some .	0000000000000000000000
0	appearance : the beers body is a light yellow coloration . the head was white and shortly lived . tiny bubbles of carbonation roll to the top of my glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dark , cloudy , dirty brown ; one finger-width head , light lacing . overall the color looks like muddy water , not very appealing .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : on draught from a nitro tap . the beer pours a deep coal black with a rich creamy almond head . as expected from nitrogen , the unrelenting head forms tiny bubbles consistently coating the top of this stout .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pale straw color , clear . some carbonation . small head that disappears really quick .	000000000000000000
0	appearance : the color is a barely-there pale yellow , comparable to bud light , really . the head was a bit more impressive than the colour -- thick with a hint of peach to it . left some nice lacing on the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : first of all , one of my favorite glasses around . just an over-sized glass with great markings . excellent to look at . a clear golden pour with a very generous head .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : deep amber - almost looks like brown ale . the head was originally very good , nice thick and tan , but it decimated completely about a quarter of the way through the beer . i will give it the benefit of the doubt the bar may have had a dirty glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : slightly hazy with a slight off white ead . brownish almost copper colored	000000000000000
0	appearance : hazy straw yellow , good lacing , and medium head .	0000000000000
1	a : this beer had a mind of its own . i poured cautiously and yet a massive head evolved with big chunky rocks of foam . it reminded me of whipped marshmallow topping , the kind you can get in a jar . color was not totally white but rather close . a factory of bubbles amongst soft tangerine and yellow colored body . it gets a 5 just for the head ... never seen anything like it	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a crystal clear orange-gold body . the head is a short-lived off-white foam cap ; it retreats into a very thin collar and leaves no lacing down the sides . there are a few clumps of bubbles on top of the brew , aided by soda-like effervescence that shoots up the center .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured a nice , thick dark tan head which persisted nicely . color is very dark brown -- pretty much opaque .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : we all know what a budweiser looks like .	00000000000
0	a : hazy brownish/orange body with some minor floating sediment as i poured towards the bottom of the bottle . a thin off-white head formed but did n't last long . the retention is nice leaving a thin ring , and splotchy lacing on the walls .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark brownish-red body with little light escaping at the bottom of the glass . two fingers of frothy light yellow head with great retention and lacing . truly exceptional .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : strawcoloured , with a rather nice-looking white head that sadly dissipates to quickly .	0000000000000000
0	a : dark orangish amber with a tannish hue . not much head to speak of and minimal lacing .	00000000000000000000
1	a : redish-black , plenty of tan head , nice lacing . could n't be better .	00000000000000000
0	a : well starting off to say that there was absolutly no depressurization when i uncapped this 22 ... pours cloudy orange amber with dismal head . large bubbles , either this beer was n't shipped well or my local brew shop owess me an apology .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a three finger thin head devoid of cream and of poor retention . hazy yellow colour . pretty unappealing . sm : light lemon ester and a barley note . a bit pathetic .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : intentionally cloudy , great amberish-orange color .	000000000
0	appearance : nice dark amber with a little carbonation . i was slightly disapointed by the small amount of head	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a pretty orangish-yellow hue with less than a third of a finger of white head that lasts a matter of seconds before dissipating to a very light ring around the edge of the glass . carbonation is evident as there 's quite a bit of nucleation , but overall retention is next to nada . the brew itself is quite hazy , and this is to be expected with the style .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear deep ruby body . a very thin 1/8 '' struggles to form , even with an aggressive pour , and fades very quickly to just some thin spots around the glass . a few teeny tiny dots of lacing are left on the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : bright , clear amber with a fluffy blanket of white froth .	00000000000000
1	a : orangey , pinkish red color with about 1 finger of creamy white head , alcohol legs are present . leaves beautiful lacing on the sides of the glass as it warms . beautiful looking beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : 750ml bottle poured into duvel tulip . the bottle itself is a work of fine craft . colour is a deep , dark brownish black . head barely exists , just a thin film with some bubbles around the rim .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dark amber with poor head retention . even after trying to swirl the brew a bit the head quickly dissipated into nothingness .	0000000000000000000000000
1	a : a very pleasing pour of coffee hues w/ a thin off-white / egg-shell head.. light but decent lacing	00000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy gold with a white head that died within seconds of pouring .	000000000000000
0	a : pour is straw-colored with a white fluffy head that sets quickly , leaving only little lace .	0000000000000000000
1	appearance : i 'm a huge fan of this beer 's appearance . it is mildly dark in colour with a deep rich , ruby read colour that really glows when held up to light . it pours with a nice dense , slightly rocky head .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a light copper with a small ivory head . my taster was quite soiled from several other pours that morning , however .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : opaque black color that transmits dark brown around the edges . one finger of beige foam head diminishes to a fine peripheral ring . no lacing remains on the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazey bronze color with an orange tint . poured with one finger stark white head that dissipated quickly to a skim . no noticeable lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : crystal clear gold color with no carbonation to be seen . no head , no nothing except liquid to look at . at least it does n't have things floating in it .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a red-amber color with less than a fingers worth of head . lacing and retention are poor . about average in general , but below average for a sam adams .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a dark , um , brown in the glass with some light penetration indicating it 's not opaque . oh well . the head is pretty fizzy , with two fingers of creamy beige bubbles generated at first , before receding into a half-finger cap on top of the brew . some streaks of lacing as i drink .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : very pale , light watered-down yellow .	000000000
1	appearance : when poured into an american pint glass , this sam adams was a straight up coffee black with a few brownish ruby red highlights at the bottom of the beer . that was the only place where a little light could shine through the darkness that is called sam adams cream stout . not only was the color great , but it had an excellent 1 1/2 to 2 inch mocha colored head of foam that left behind tons of mocha colored rings and lace around the glass . if that was n't enough , there was also a small mocha film over the top of the the beer that lasted the entire duration of the beer 's life in my glass . i just ca n't say enough good things about the appearance of this beer . it was amazing !	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a slightly hazy ruby-brown with an inch of foamy off-white head on top . head is slow to settle leaving behind a nice lace along the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a medium amber color with a very robust creamy white head . it came out about 1 1/2 thumbs thick and settled down to about half . it has a very creamy and milky head . carbonation consists of very fine bubbles . lacing is incredible .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours black with milk chocolate colored head . major milk-stout lacing and on a violent pour you can definitely end up with 3+ finger head .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : it pours beautiful brownish gold colour with a very generous foamy white head . it dissappears fast , but it leave nice laces . good carbonation	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : drank straight from a 24 oz . can , although have poured it in a glass mug before , typical straw color from what i remember .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours super dark , thick , and black as pitch . massive head that lingers for awhile . lacing is huge as it drinks .	000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : clear , pale yellow color , utterly transparent and shallow , but blessed with a full and frothy pure white head .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : absolutely beautiful looking brew . rich golden hue with pillowy head that did not dissipate hardly at all .	000000000000000000000
0	a : pale greenish yellow color . head is not dense at all , fizzy , and has horrible retention . not really any lacing either . 3.0	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a hazy golden with a thick bubbly white head that slowly faded into a thick film that lasted the whole beer through and left an incredible fuzzy sheet of solid lacing down the glass . beautiful .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours an intense , somewhat murky dark copper color . and there 's no other way to put it , but the head on this sucks . it 's an off-white color that starts wimpy and somehow retains itself even worse than that . lacing is minimal . the kostritzer pilsener glass seems to hate beer heads , for some reason ...	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : typical , straw , fizzy head . no lacing , no retention .	000000000000000
1	a : vigorous pour yielded a creamy 2 finger light caramel colored head with great retention and outrageous frothy web-like lacing . brew itself is deep almost opaque brown .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : light brown , which is dark for the style . generous head and incredible lacing . what a great look .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a bright light amber with a large dense head that reduced into a delightfully thick dense foam dollop that floated on top of the beer . very active carbonation and fantastic lacing . head stayed forever with very impressive retention .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours black in color but more opaque and dark brown when held up to a light . thick tan head that disappeared quicker than i was anticipating .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : on the plus size the beer was star bright and a beautiful straw/golden color . true to style . on the negative side the bright white head was small to moderate and it went away quickly . only a thin broken white foam was left on top and there was no lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : only one finger of foamy off-white head is produced on the pour and it is fairly quick to recede . a persistent film remains on top of a light golden-orange colored body . impressive clarity . no lacing to speak of .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : i opened the bottle and started to walk into my computer lounge when dollop dollop big fluff of foam were coming out of the top of the bottle and landing on the tops of my bare feet.. i t was n't shaken a bit . when the poured the translucent reddish brown brew into the glass surprisingly there was n't but a one finger head that nearly disappears . it does lace nicely though .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a beautiful hazy orange colour . huge fluffy , rocky white head . lots of retention and lace .	0000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dark brown with a tan , creamy lace . there was a hell of a lot of sediment in the bottle . pouring chunks of yeast in the glass was unavoidable .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : when poured into a glass that resembles a stange , the beer was a nice dark copper mahogany color with a creamy 2 finger head of foam that was almost a pure white color . it had excellent retention leaving behind plenty of white foamy rings and white sticky lace around the glass . the beer 's appearance was just as nice as the label that was on the bottle .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : best lookin ipa i 've found to date . beautify pale gold with good head and lacing to boot .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours with that distinctive disturbance pattern within the body , where a caramel color is mixed with a darker , blackish color . the caramel swirls settle down , and leave just the dark color behind . there is a very healthy looking creamy head that seemingly never dissipates . when held up to the light , i see tinges of red , confirming the reports that this beer 's color is actually `` dark ruby . '' overall , this beer always looks very good . it 's very picturesque .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours a darker cloudy orange colour w/ a 1 finger head . plenty of lacing the whole time while drinking .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : 12 oz . nr poured into a sa glass . beer is crystal clear and rusty red , with loads of active carbonation and a one finger head of pink-hued foam that shows above average retention and leaves some fine lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours an opaque bronze with a thin bubbly head that quickly disappears	00000000000000
0	a : poured from a 12oz into a pint glass . cloudy tan/red liquid with a thin head .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : light black with some garnet highlights . clear despite the colour . the head disappeared as the beer was being poured . as there was almost no head , there was no head retention .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a very clear copper , light amber color with a very thin white head that disappears almost immediately . got ta love the english pint bottle , looks regal imo .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : gorgeous crystal clear orange amber with a tall white head that falls to a lacy white ring	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : poor pour from bart ender yields small head . i know this beer has more , however lacing is very unimpressive . its dim in the pub but the color appears to be a darker amber . smell a weird veggie hop smell of cooked spinach , broccoli and grass as well a citrus hop smell . slightest smell of the european pale malt .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : thick and black , dark almond head ( more like a thin disk of residual bubbles )	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : black liquid , more brown than red , with an adequate head and good lacing . could use a bit more head , and head colour is too pale .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : nice rich brownish hue topped by a decent sized coffee/tan head .	00000000000000
1	appearance : poured into a pint glass a light , crisp , golden and transparent color . the head is almost perfect , about a quarter inch thick . looks very appetizing .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a deep brown with a soda-like head that quickly fizzes away to nothing . zero lacing .	00000000000000000000
1	a : aptly yclept schwarzbier ( blackbeer ) -- dark opaque black with a frothy head and a ruddy hue around the edges . good lacing . i like the way this looks .	0000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : pours a yellow tinge with a quarter finger length that just is n't all that pretty .	0000000000000000000
1	a : dark burnt rose . it has the color of a setting sun on a cool fall day . the head starts 2 fingers high but quickly disappears to just a lacing across the top of this beautiful beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : clear , bright red in color . poured less than a one finger white head that dissipated very quickly to a skim . no lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : inky , oily blackness , both in appearance and in viscosity , just as you would expect from something calling itself black bier . opaque with very little carbonation . took a bit of effort to tease the head up . when accomplished , it was a deep dark brown head that dissipated off with no lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours a clear but slightly hazy body with thick 3 finger white head . not bad , better than i expected .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear straw like color with a finger of white head .	000000000000000
1	a : pours a beautiful bronze with ruby highlights . giant peach/brown head that shows great retention . it nestles in like a pillow on top of the beer , and shows no signs of moving anytime soon . great lacing as it goes down the glass . this beer looks fantastic .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pitch black pour with 2 fingers of fairly dark brown head . it recedes slowly and sticks around on top of the beer forever . beautiful beer .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pale clear amber , it poured with a big cream head with lacing that slowly died .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours with one finger of pure white head , which bubbles like a soda . this settles quickly , leaving only a very thing , very small island of foam . the beer itself is pale yellow and perfectly clear . some moderate activity . no sediment in the bottle .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : looks amazing as is expected from a duvel product . though i will say there are some albeit minor but notable differences between the standard duvel gold and this . im mainly noticing this in the spiderwebbing action on the head which is pretty wild . head retention is unreal . it literally collected and in my duvel tulip and clung like a web . rocky does not do this bone white mass of sticky looking froth justice . otherwise this beer is very bright , and is a light straw color .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a brownish orange color as expected . looks a little cloudy .	000000000000000

1	appearance : it pours a rich brown colour with 1 1/2 finger white foam head .	0000000000000000
1	a : beautiful two inch creamy head . incredible creamy yellowy orange color with micro rising carbonation .	000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a deep rusted brown and is cloudy with an immense 2 1/2 finger , off-white , foamy head that fades and retains at a skim . huge lacing swathes the walls of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : orange/amber hue that surprisingly leaves little to no head . no lacing either . for reason i remembered that being different	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours with 2 1/2 fingers of medium tan head . this settles very slowly to a thin , nearly complete cap and leaving behind amazing lacing . the beer itself is black as night . a small amount of sediment remains in the bottle and the last portion of the pour seemed a little cloudy .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : crystal clear pale straw color with thin bone-white head .	000000000000
0	a : hazy yellow-gold color with virtually no head formation , even with an aggressive pour .	00000000000000000
0	a : my pint arrived looking black as night upon first glance . a closer study reveals a thinning root-beer brown rim to it . a tiny beige head settled out rather quickly leaving spots of lace about the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : an average pour produces 2 1/2 fingers of a foamy , rose-stained white cap . respectable retention . hazy with 25 % transparency when backlit . completely opaque otherwise . the body is medium-dark burgundy in color . thick sheets of foamy lace lather each edge of the tulip . as jolly pumpkin beers tend to be , this one is another stunner in the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured from bottle into standard pint glass . pours a golden color with very little head and no lacing observed .	00000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a mostly clear light brown color with a small white head . it quickly drops to essentially nothing . this is disappointing looking .	000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear golden-amber body . 1-1/4 '' tan head fades very slowly to a thick film . quite a few thick strings and dots of lacing are left on the glass . lots of tiny carbonation bubbles rise at a moderate pace from all over the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : very dark almost black . there is a magical cascading effect within the beer as it settles . a beautiful off white head remains perfect throughout the experience lacing is awesome .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear amber to copper color with small white head and pretty nice lacing around the glass that clings nicely .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : this dark lager poured a beautiful clear amber color that showed off a ton of carbonation . the body was topped by a thick , creamy , off-white head which left thick rings of lace on the side of the glass . i was extremely impressed by the appearance of this beer . i actually did not expect much ( i do n't know why ) , so i was pleasantly surprised .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : very dark brown with red hues , it poured with a small chocolate spritzy head that immediately died to a very thin collar .	00000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a beautiful hazy dark amber color with a finger of foamy off white head that leaves a little bit of lacing and good retention .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a muddy ruddy burnt orange with a firm soapy white head and good lace . the clarity of an ipa certainly is n't there .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pale , light amber . fair amount of bubbles . small head with very light lacing .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : light amber ... similar to an american lager but with more carbonation	00000000000000
0	a : pours a very light orange amber color , veeery light . a 1/4 in . head build but turns to a simple lace pretty quickly . not too impressive .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very cloudy , pours with a nice strong off white coloured head . the beer colour is a dark honey .	00000000000000000000000
0	appearance : golden to darker straw yellow with a white head that dies down to eventually nothing . very mild lacing here and there initially , but eventually that goes away as well .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a nice and deep brown/yellow color . held to the light and a more rich yellowish copper comes out . the really crazy part of this beer is the head . really poured a nice finger of white head that seems like it would have amazing retention if it was n't so damned sticky . the head just sits on the glass and does n't move once it has found a bare piece of glass . the beer is pretty clear as well . damned good looking beer .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured an almost jet-black color with traces of ruby highlights in it . also had a nice one inch head of tan colored foam that left little lace .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : crystal clear pour with no visible carbonation , but a huge tan head which leaves very nice lacing on the glass . the beer looks great !	00000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours the color of a tripel ; that burnt golden orange appearance . translucent and less hazy then a tripel . its actually rather clear . head is gigantic and rocky which dissipates slowly into a thick rocky soapy lacing that clings to the glass tenaciously and refuses to let go . it even have yeast in the bottle which i found out on the last pour of my bomber . so really proper looking for an imperial ipa and the color of a tripel . i 'm giving this a 5 ! its a beautiful beer	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : this really , really looks like cream soda . maybe it 's the clear glass bottle , but it pours the color of cream soda , maybe a shade more red , with very , very light , bright white head that goes away almost immediately . hm .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : gentle pour creates a 3 finger powdery white head with incredible retention . beer is a clear lemon yellow . lacing is patchy and ringed with great cling . a beautiful beer to behold .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : with a ( former ) name like 'black mamba ' , one might have reasonably expected a dark ebony pour , maybe reptilian . that assumption would have been woefully off-base , which is probably why the recent name-shortening occurred ; this is a murky apricot/butterscotch orange , completely hazy and almost entirely lacking a head . put another way : it 's like the cloudiest , deadest-looking hefeweizen i 've ever seen .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours brown , with no head and no lacing . looks like it might be flat . no lacing to speak of either .	00000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : looking into the glass it had a deep reddish brown colored body with a creamy light tan head . the head was long lasting , thick and it left tons of sticky lacing to cling to the sides of the glass in thick rings . ( very impressive )	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : one of the most gorgeous beer i 've ever seen . pours a dark ruby ale , fully translucent . head is tan and very very strong .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : i think i just like this beer for the color . do n't get me wrong it smells and tastes wondeful , but if i had to pick the most beautiful color in the world this beer would be it . it 's a deep red brown , and looks almost the color of cranberry juice when held up to the light .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : well , here is the kind of massive head i would expect from a belgian style beer ; the liquid is a hazy straw color with a honey aspect to it as well ; plenty of lace squiggles are left behind	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a very sudsy pub cask like look to this one with sticky lacing , a beautiful finger of fluffy head and a darker orange body . great start .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : murky dark gold , lots of carbonation but litle head not very impressive .	0000000000000000
1	appearance : is perfect ! ! ! of course the nitro makes that happen but is a gorgeous pour with excellent cascading carbonation and a head that continues to grow and form even after the beer is set in front of me . the head lasts almost the entire duration of the beer and the lacing is big chucky foam spot pasted to the glass none other .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a one finger head of slight cream , decent thickness , and downright bad retention . semitransparent copper colour . sm : mainly a moderate quantity of bittering hops ( i ca n't discern which ) with some caramelized malt somewhere in there . a mild strength aroma .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pitch black and completely opaque . massive 2 finger mocha colored foamy and rocky head that was there to the finish . left tons of lacing . i ca n't recall many big stouts with such an impressive looking head .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : light golden brown , slightly cloudy with decent head retention on the white head	0000000000000000
0	a : pours hazy straw-colored with a really small white head that quickly sinks into almost no lacings .	0000000000000000000
1	a : i feel like full sail beers are gorgeous ; amber body with a lot of carbonated movement ; fluffy tight bubbled white head with copious laceage	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a decent airy and bubbly head , about 1/2 a finger that quickly fades to a light covering . another brilliantly clear offering with a pale orange light toasty brown color . very few bubbles rise to the top and let the head fade to dust . n : yep , just as i thought , a sweet pumpkin aroma with lots of spice , and almost a creamy syrup and vanilla . lots of pumpkin and syrup and spice blanket the nose .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : thin and inattentive off white lace that barely stays around . this ale is very clear with a bright shaded orangey copper hue .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : brown gold color , head looks like the top of a latt , lacing is pretty good	0000000000000000000
0	a : very clear and has the color of apple juice or some whiskeys . the head was at about a half inch after pouring and it disappeared quickly after .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a deep brown with dark ruby highlights around the edges . about a half finger of foam fades quickly leaving almost nothing on top and no lacing . kinda looks like a coke or root beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : beautiful , pitch-black , opaque , ebondy hue with a slight tan head that quickly receded ...	0000000000000000000
1	a : the brew 's best quality by far . hazy orange with a nice head .	00000000000000000

0	appearance : this beer poured a copper-red color with a rough , thin head . it disappeared ( the head , that is ) within a minute , leaving not a trace of its prior existence . that 's about it ; no lace , no nothin ' .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours a hazy , dark amber body slim , off-white head .	00000000000000
0	appearance : very pale yellow , slightly hazy . not cloudy , as the style should be . i coaxed a finger of head , but i did n't have the power to persuade it to stay around . it was gone in less than 30 seconds , leaving a pathetic most-of-a-ring of bubbles . so unlike what i thought a hefeweisbier should be .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : bit of a gusher for sure . watch out . pours a huge , foamy , loose , white head that just wont quit . could only pour half the bottle in . cloudy gamboge orange with massive amounts of carbonation . out of control . head still mounding out of the glass after five minutes , but finally it fades to a good foam cap with piles of chunky foam down the sides of the glass . not really that attractive , and the head was a pain with all that carbonation .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : great head retention with decent lacing . even with a careful poor i ended up with a huge , tan rocky head . this beer looks a whole lot better than it tastes with a bit cloudy , dark ruddy brown color , and that big aforementioned head .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : apparently this beer is bottle-conditioned as it says to expect `` a fine layer of yeast at the bottom '' , but i see no sign of any debris . in fact , this is one of the most crystal clear beers i 've ever seen . an over-zealous pour left a plentiful head that consisted of strangely large bubbles . never have i seen that before . lacing is plentiful , but patchy . 3.0	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pitch black , reflecting a well-chosen name . the head is a moderate-lived cocoa-colored affair that recedes into a floating patch of film on top of the brew . a few rings here and there , but generally no lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : slightly hazy sepia-orange , oddly reminiscent of shag carpet ( do n't ask me why ) with a fizzy , parchment-colored head that rushes in and out of existence like a flustered mayfly . lame .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours pretty much a pitch black in the glass , with a hint of mahogany translucence around the edges . the head is thick and cream-colored ; retention is outstanding , and it leaves nice lacing down the glass . truly a pleasure to see .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : a light cream ring around the glass with some foam on the top . i think that the head is non existent because of the alcohol content . the color of the beer is dark brown oil color . the clarity is opaque . there is some effervescence on the sides of the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : blood red to maroon . beautiful reddish hues come off the glass . could this be the blood of the gargoyle on the label ? a crisp white head crowns the top . as it falls , a lovely lace kisses the edge of the glass . carbonation is just right and not over lively .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : foggy golden pour with a crackling white topping , not quite a finger and gone in 30 seconds . after that , virtually no remnants of a head , a few freckles . no lace at all . color is fine , but otherwise - well - it 's kind of a yawner .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : the bottle pops open and pours into a big tulip-shaped wine glass a golden-hued nectar , coming with a fast effervescent , rocky , meringue like fluffy but bloody tight paper-white beer head with very good retention ; the highly-carbonated body is not just fizzy -- it 's like raining/then drizzling bottom-up , or even like a hot spring ! ! massive , it looks ... the foamy cap sustains the best i 've ever seen .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : this pours a hazy brown color with no head . flavor : this has some sourness to it , along with a mixture of subtle , complex flavors . it finishes very smoothly . the alcohol is completely hidden and sneaks up on you later .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : forms a nice 1.5 finger frothy head in my sa perfect pint glass with very good retention . it 's a crystal clear beer with varying colors , being auburn orange at the thinner parts and ruby red at the thicker , and a good amount of bubbles floating up from the etch at the bottom . the head even leaves a slight lacing , as a memory of each sip . perfect appearance at least . n : nice piny hops really to start , with some fresh resiny musty wet hops as well . a touch of earthy chewy hops and hints of citrus . with that is some lighter dark malty aromas underneath that are hard to get to through the hops .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : orange , red ale with excellent clarity . no head - as expected . no yeast in glass or bottle - must have been micro-filtered and forced carbonated .	0000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours a slightly cloudy burnt orange color with a solid 1 '' head of off-white bubbles that was quite creamy looking . there are tons of bubbles rising to maintain the head and it was every bit as bit as it was initially at least two minutes after the pour . so far , this is a pretty nice looking beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : i was initially impressed when i poured the beer . clear orange-copper color . the head initially looked impressive but did not last long enough . the lack of head retention surprised me for such a hoppy ipa	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a motor oil black with a 1 finger creamy milk chocolate brown head . head dissipates slowly into chocolate milk-like bubbles . excellent lacing . like all the other yetis , this one looks perfect .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured from bottle with a rigorous head , thick and creamy that settled into nothing . i am now looking at an amber colored liquid with no white . very poor .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a robust porter , pitch black to dark brown brew depending on how the light falls through the glass . a beige airy head about a finger tall with very good retention span . some foamy curtains gliding the the side of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear golden with a massive frothy , rocky head with great sustain .	00000000000000000
1	appearance : despite zero gushing when opening the bottle , this rather carbonated beer leaves a three inch fizzy and rocky just-offwhite head that dissipates steadily , leaving ephemeral , bubbly lacing webs . pours a hazy orange and leaves occasional swoops of lacing along the glass . looks really good .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : this beer pours an oily , slick black and has no carbonation at all . no head . no lacing . looking inside the bottle i see huge chunks of black sludge . it looks disgusting .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : cool swing-top 1.5l bottle . whoa ! is this sucker pretty . i 'm not sure that i have ever seen a beer this strong and this clear . 8.5 % percent alcohol and i can see to the other side . truly , remarkable clarity . good , deep golden color and a pretty darn good head , too . smells like : not bad at all . bud typically has that crap-american cheap lager scent that reminds me of waking up in backyards circa 10th grade . private reserve however , is much better . more refined . i suppose it is only the smell of husk and rice , but overall , quite pleasing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : nice amber-red color with a little brown ; darker than i thought it 'd be . nice off-white head too , with great lacing . looks fantastic !	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : this american pale wheat ale is typical with a slight carbonation when poured into a standard pint glass . i wish the restaurant would have poured my beer into a weizen glass , however beggers ca n't be choosers . light golden color , however with the slightest amount of cloudiness .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : poured from a 22 . oz . 'er that says it ' s from canada , not ireland . it left a medium brown head of about an inch that quickly receded to surface skim , and thick , but ephemeral lacing . i know everyone says it 's black , but it 's really the darkest shade of brown possible ( you can see this in bright light ) , and opaque ( even in bright light ) .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours an effervescent and translucent goldenrod , capped by a finger of white head that quickly settles down to a thin layer . it holds fairly steady there , but not an impressive head for a saison .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear gold with a very short-lived head and no lace . it appears to be decently carbonated , but it ca n't maintain a head . possibly a bad sign ...	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear golden body with some slight weight in it . small bubble rising up to the top where a three finger spongy bright white head rests . lacing is pronounced on the non-sipping side of the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : fantastic clarity , golden , and a relentless head , a 3 millimeter head is still visible after 20 minutes , leaving rings of lace in its wake .	0000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : golden haze with a nice lacing similar to smuttynose finest kind	0000000000000
0	appearance : clear copper glass with definite red tints . respectable cover of off white tiny bubbles that slowly collars and disappears leaving a few wisps of lace . flavor : smoky ! smoked flavor overshadows most other tastes . some malt comes through , and the malt seems balanced . the smoke has to be the roasted peppers , but no real pepper flavors noted either . as my mouth gets used to the smoke , i start to get a bit of citric hop .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : charcoal black and completely opaque . vigorous pour yieds a 3 inch head that is thick and creamy . caramel colored head with great retention . generous lace clings to the sidesof the crystal glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : deep prune-brown , minimal wisp ring , minimal legs , no lacing . 3/5	0000000000000000
0	appearance : more red than i expected for an apa . tiny , tight head bubbles did n't last long in a clean pint glass .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : serious issues with the carbonation - upon opening the bottle it overflowed and even a gentle pour down the side of the glass gave me a half inch of beer to 5 inches of head , the resulting head is mildly brown and looks reminds me of ocean froth , dark brown to black in color with a faint crimson hue - 2.25 ,	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : poured with a large light tan foamy bubbly head , that dissipated quickly to a thin layer leaving just about no lacing . the beer is a cloudy orange brown color .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : very nearly black in color with a nice thick head that is beige in color . the head bulk of the head dissipated more quickly than i had expected , but the remaining layer was thinly lying on top with almost no chunkiness remaining . there was however , some nice lacing left behind .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very dissappointing for a witbier . instead of a wheat coloring , it almost looked like a pale . it was rather clear for a witbier .	00000000000000000000000000000

0	a : very hazy bright gold color , absolutely no head at all . really , i was n't watching the bartender pour the beer , and a minute later when i was looking at it there was absolutely zero head . you ca n't even swirl this around to get a hint of carbonation . this fact did n't change after adding the syrup . very strange .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : nothing special , but poured to an amazingly bubbly , tall 4 finger head with a dark amber/brown fig like tinted body . high carbonation only revealed under the light .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured into a wv glass . a hazy dark yellow color with a head that i missed since i looked in another direction ( for 3 seconds ) while rvdoorn poured the beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : before i even crack the bottle open , i should note that it 's filled far higher than any other beer i 've seen . pours to am extremely clear straw-golden color with an absurd ( 4 finger ) white head . i could n't decant the whole 11.2 oz bottle off the yeast because the head was going to overflow out of a pint sized glass . this thing has bubbles racing to the surface at break-neck speed .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : clear , dark orange-ammber with a small white head that quickly fades to nothing . minimal lacing .	00000000000000000000
1	appearance : when poured into a snifter it appears that the color of the beer is as black as the carignan-salires regiment hats were , but in reality the beer 's color was more of a dark murky brown color with yeast particles . the head of foam made up for the color . the head of foam was beige in color and at least a 2 finger . when it receded it left some beige foamy rings and a bare minimum amount of beige lace around the glass . it 's too bad the carignan-salires regiment did n't wear murky brown hats because then it would have match the color of this beer perfectly !	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : deep dark walnut in color with mahogany red edges . a busty foamy cap on top ... head is monstrous ! not only is the head big its retention is just as good . head was a soft tan ( cappuccino ) color with craters , mounds , and dense chunks forming all the while leaving a bleary coating of lace . a very good look to this one	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours a deep copper body with a lush , creamy-looking white head .	000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear grapefruit pink body with golden tones against the light . the head in three separate glasses varies a bit , but on the whole it 's lackluster , rising only to a quarter-inch in height and receding rather quickly . no lace . looks kind of like juice , actually . there are some floating strands of protein or fruit pith that are a little off-putting , actually .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : the bottle was incredibly hard to get open . inside the bottle a huge amount of yeast and sediment is visible . this will have to be a very careful pour for sure . poured from the 750 ml corked bottle into a tulip glass . the beer is a bright yellow color with lots of sediment floating around . head is 3 or so fingers , offwhite and sticks around a bit wile leaving clumps along the side of the glass . overall a good looking beer , but the huge amount of sediment is a bit off .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : crystal clear . white head . nice lacing	0000000000

0	a : looks like a brown ale . you know what i mean .	00000000000000
0	a : 'midnight ' dark ( nearly black ) pour , with a slim head . good ringing lace that trails fang-like tendrils of tawny film ... but overall , eh it 's just an average stout , nothing remarkable whatsoever .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : nothing to complain about here - dark black , with a mocha colored head that hung around for a while .	00000000000000000000000

1	appearance : the look of this beer is exceptional . it is a burnt brown color with a huge pillowy head . there is tons of sticky lacing that makes this beer look geourgious .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the can exploded ( mostly into the glass ) with creamy head and produced the beautiful downward drifting bubbles that makes nitro-things look so interesting . two fingers of tight , creamy head . the beer is burnished copper and quite clear . no visible bubbles once the head settled . some lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : huge , creamy , tan head with insane lacing . very dark red-brown , but not utterly opaque . ruby glints in the light . it certainly looks impressive .	00000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dark amber , caramel hue with almost a finger of tan head and large bubbles .	00000000000000000000
0	a : dark cocoa brown resembles a darker coke color and in texture . it could have used a thicker head that did n't disappear with a quickness . this beer looks flat and unappealing to me .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : russet or ruby hued , with great clarity ; the beige beer head comes thick and tightly frothy ... remaining 1cm thick throughout the drink . an almost perfect pint poured by handpumps , if not for the slightly warmish serving temp .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a beautiful sunset orange with tones of red . combine to create a peach hue when held up to the light . a finger and a half of frothy sudsy eggshell head that looks like it might stick around for a bit . some nice lacing left where it has actually fallen . some little sediment bits in there too which is a plus in my bookunfiltered = more flavor .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : crystal clear gold color , with no head at all , just a slight film . i used a clean hand-washed glass , so i 'm knocking off points .	00000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : cloudy lemmin yellow topped by an explosive white head . no real retention or lacing to speak of .	000000000000000000000
0	appearance : i expect a much better head from a belgian ipa . this one retains alright , but it is small to begin with , even after a pretty strong pour . the beer itself is a thickly yeast-hazed , bright sunflower orange-yellow , not unlike a hefeweizen .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear , medium amber beer with a thin layer of white foam that recedes to a ring rather quickly . there is a tiny amount of lacing apparent . based on the style , it is far clearer than it should be , presumably due to the boil .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : this beer pours dark brown with a reddish tone . the small off-white head dissipates quickly into almost no lacings .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a very dark red , when not up to the light looks black . initial head is big and promising , but turns out very fizzy on subsequent pours , like cola .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : clear golden with a reddish hue and a white head that falls back into the beer . flavor : wine cooler type flavor , blueberry . the ending of the swallow finishes with a lingering bitterness which reminds you that this is not a wine cooler but a beer . hints of caramel malt .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : nice coloration with some light lacing . 22oz bottle poured into a pint glass .	00000000000000000

1	a : hazy yellow with a frothy head that has great retention ; what a hefeweiss should look like	0000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours out a crystalline , yellow-body with a tall , lasting , pure white head . looks pretty nice , as did the bottle presentation , but is the beer nice ?	0000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : golden , hay color with a frothy/rocky 3 finger head . served in a hofbrauhaus weizen glass ( .5 l ) . very cloudy , almost looked viscous . fortunately they left out the lemon wedge they usually serve there . i know its common for people to serve hefes with lemon , but i think the flavor of this beer should speak for itself .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : clear orange little carbonation , very small head	0000000000

1	a : black . nice coffee colored head , which is fairly big , and is sticking around .	0000000000000000000
1	appearance : burnt amber with a big bubbly pure white head that has a steam of rising carbonation feeding it . tons of stickage as the head slowly drops . pretty stuff .	000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : pours a hazed caramel amber with a relatively fast-fading offwhite head . the lacing is runny , glittery , fast-fading ; the collar is thin to practically non-existent , and the sheen is , well , definitely nonexistent . not too much goin ' on here .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear dark yellow with a medium head that dissipates very quickly .	0000000000000000
0	a : the lacing provided by this beer is stunning . a `` continental '' patterning along the glass is remarkable . head quickly dissipates , but this is a good thing . the liquid is is a transparent goldenrod .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a head that lasts for an average time , that left no lacing nor foam at the edge atop a beer that 's a red-brown ? red-brown ? is this not named after oil and claims to be a dark ale ?	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : very dark orange almost brown . excellent two finger head that recedes moderately . it looks there some yeast suspended in the the glass . not very impressed with the looks of this one . there is some nice lacing that is left , i am happy with that part .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this thing has a huge head . a perfect billowy light-tan colored head with so much fluff , it might as well be whipped cream . the beer is a darker shade of brown when poured , and nearly black in the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : damn near perfect in my book . nicely hazy , radiant golden orange color . it 's got a big , soapy head that settles into a cap and leaves big sheets of lacing . so far so good .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark brown with copper hues . not much foam . no lace .	000000000000000
0	a : a mildly murky , orange hue ( cross between rust and carrot , but not quite amber or copper ) . head was a bit unimpressive , soda-like , and diminished quickly .	00000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : clear medium-light gold with a small , white , quickly and fully-diminishing , fizzy head .	000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a medium looking white head with good retention . head slowly fades to a good foam cap and clings to the sides . cloudy gamboge orange in color with no carbonation evident . a good wisp remains until the end and leaves sheets of lacing down the sides of the glass . a great looking brew for sure .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : lovely dark red-brown , nearly opaque , with an antique-white froth that 's thin but resilient .	0000000000000000000

0	appearance : suspicious explosive head formation going on here . what a fucking mess . and we 're within the best before time line . the drain is on stand-by ! clear , yellow body with , again , a monstrous , foamy white head .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : relatively clear golden-copper color . darker than most mexican brews , which is nice to see for once . not much for head but it is an adjunct lager , after all . leaves spotty lacing on the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pour is a deep toffee brown color and starts with a very short 1/2 finger head that fades quickly to a thin and uneven skim ; body is semi-opaque and looks like a thick iced tea ; a few spots of lacing are left behind .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : really beautiful . intense deep brown . dark as you could ask for , admitting no light through the beer , and with a beautiful chocolate colored head that lingers for a few minutes , and gives way to just a ring of foam around the edge of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : jet black with some garnet around the edges when held to ( candle ) light ; about the most enjoyable thing about guinness is watching the bubbles work their way up the glass , creating a nice and tight , light almond head , leaving nothing but an opaque blackness below ...	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : huge snowy head , billowing above the glass . classic belgian carbonation , bravo . color is light honey , slightly hazed . dozens and dozens of streams of bubbles aggresively charge the surface of the glass . lots of lace resides all over the sides of the glass . honestly , this beer could n't look any better . simply stunning , put together amazingly well .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : even poured slowly to try and minimize the head , i still wound up with a three finger head that was the color and consistency of that foam that you squirt into your walls to insulate them . but it died down within a few minutes and left some nice lacing behind . the color is a very nice dark reddish amber with only a small amount of carbonation . a good start !	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours very black with a large tan colored head . very nice staying power , slow dissipation to a ring of foam on the top . beautiful sheets of lacing down the sides . looks amazing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy darker yellow color with a small , quickly fading head ... nice lacing .	00000000000000000
0	a : semi-dark clear yellow with a thin whitish head	0000000000
1	a : perfect . soft brown with faint burnt orange hues at the edges . billowing tan head barely contained in this glass . settles to leave full layer of fine tan lacing . as you sip the soft foam coats the side of the glass in sheets not patches . also visible is the active carbonation and flecks of yeast floaties .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a staw color , no head , no lace	000000000000
0	a : pours light amber to red . definitely uncharacteristic of a brown ale . i 've had red 's darker than this . zero-head . wondering if i got a bad bottle as most other posts have a decent head present .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a black body with a small , tan head with no real retention and minimal lacing .	00000000000000000000
1	a : amazing head on top of a dark yellow body launches up to the top of the glass and hangs out forever , ending its long life in a spiderweb of beauty . glass is soapy all the way down . this beer could not look any more inviting .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a deep red umber to brown with an initial three finger head which recedes quickly to a smooth cap of foam , no lace is a surprise .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : beer exploded all over the place upon popping the cork on this one . poured a cloudy yellow color , huge head , good lacing down the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : big frothy white head . pale golden body . carbonation is pretty wimpy . lacing is damn fine . ca n't really knock this beer for it 's appearance , it looks pretty good .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : upon popping the cork a massive flow of white head spewed from the bottle . a quick run to the sink and pours into our tulips and we were in business . golden orange color . huge white head . not much lace .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured a nice tan one fingered head . blackness with dark red shading on its edges , great lacing appears .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a one finger head of decent slight cream , okay thickness , and downright bad retention . colour is a clear yellow-gold . sm : slight malted barley . a mild strength aroma .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a literal explosion as the foam kept gushing out of the bottle for a good 5 minutes ! after 2 rags and putting the bottle in a large bowl , it was still streaming out like foamy lava . i decided to pour anyways because we could be here all night staring at it . the body was a dark brownish color and saw some raisins and other things floating in the bottle . none of this was off-putting save for the massive explosion . i did n't care for that at all .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : amber in color . low to no head or bubbles . great clarity .	0000000000000000
1	a : sporting a healthy two fingered head , and retention for the entire duration of drinking , and excellent retention , port 's wipeout ipa is cloudy golden in hue , and contains yeast floaties .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a black color with a huge light tan head . tons of lacing left behind .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : an unstoppable spray of foam emerges from the bottle upon opening , spilling more than half the beer on the floor . great . freshness date indicates that this is not a bad bottle , and it was not shaken . pours a reddish chestnut color with a mockingly pathetic head .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : deep copper with a light tan head , excellent retention & lacing .	000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a brilliant copper in color , extremely clear with a ton of carbonation bubbles ( not necessarily a good thing ) . the ipa is topped by a rather small , tightly foamed white head that fades quickly .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : clear light amber with a big frothy head of light tan . it has great lacing with small tidemarks noting each sip . flavor : mild flavor . very well balanced , no sweetness , no hop bitter , but the taste of malt and hops is present . a bit of the wheat malt comes in , and the spices really show off . i get hints of orange rind and maybe nutmeg or ginger ?	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pitch black with a one-finger head . poor head retention and no lacing . it looks like others have had a better looking pour ... perhaps i have this beer a little too much tlc .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pitch pitch black . might be the darkest beer i 've ever seen ( seems even darker than wws ) . no head at all . do n't know if there is a problem with my can , but the little head i had did n't last long too . no lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a cloudy reddish/brown . no head , light carbonation . not the most appealing ale i 've seen .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : extremely creamy and heady ! i just want to bite this . a good fist for a head , three fingers and then some . never recedes . so fluffy/foamy you could sleep on it like a cloud . color is just like regular yeti , black with nuances and a mocha-colored head ( cafe con leche )	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : beautiful , clear , dark ruby body under a majestic two-finger head of creamy , sticky tan foam . tons of lace . truly spectacular .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : very dark brownish red , whitish head with very small bubbles , easily 2 fingers . great retention and lacing !	00000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a nice autumnal amber/copper color . there is barely a head , and what there is dissipates almost instantly . perhaps i should have tried a more aggressive pour , but i doubt that would have helped .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear , dark brown color with garnet highlights ; over one finger of light beige foam head . heavy lacing remains on the glass .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy apricot with a wispy head that does n't retain well . leaves no lace . the weakest part of the beer .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a murky orange/ruby color with a thin cap of fluffy tan head that sits on top . pretty standard .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : golden-yellow , fizzy white head , no retention , very little lace .	000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a clear golden with a fluffy white head that thins to a persistent layer .	000000000000000000
0	a : pours almost clear , like sprite , and has just a little bit of head that fizzes out pretty quickly .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : strawy yellow color with brilliant clarity , leading me to believe this has been filtered ( probably multiple times ) . not much head , but when poured a little more aggressively the frothy bubble laden white stuff made a more noticeable appearance ( 1 fingers worth ) although it did n't stick around long . nicely carbonated with lots of rising bubbles and decent curtainous ( yes , i just made that up ) lacing . unfortunately a traditional wit should be yeasty and cloudy with good head retention but due to the filtering this is not the case here which is the reason for the `` average '' rating for appearance .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dark ruby/brown color with a small off-white head forms , comprised of rather large bubbles , and dissipates rather quickly . very thin lacing forms , but does not last .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : looks like a good respectable stout should look . dark with a good size creamy head .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : completely flat , no head or carbonation . very black with clear black edges and colossal legs , the beer seems to ooze down the sides of the glass . flavor : a taste explosion . malt , malt and more malt . dark , heavy , black hearted malt . it builds until the point that it approaches sickly sweet , then oddly , the alcohol cuts in and thins out the taste with a wisp of maple before it quickly disappears . black fruit	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : poured a pleasant gold color , transparent with a foamy head that started overflowing but came to a nice subtle thin head . there was some residue in the glass and the lacing was thick . i ca n't get over the gushing though , it was foaming all over and the sediment at the bottom was an unpleasant surprise .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours hazy and a straw colored . far too hazy and dark for the style , but it 's by no means unattractive .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a very pretty reddish lavender color with thick pink head that is very foamy , pours very hazy with no carbonation bubbles and a nice amount of lacing	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours an irregular deep brown color with ruby highlights . the head is minuscule and barely noticeable . no retention or lace . i do n't see any carbonation activity either .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : hazy medium orange color . one and a half fingers of super creamy off-white head . excellent retention and lots of lacing . awesome ! 3.5	0000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a deep red orange color with a small white head that dissipates quickly .	00000000000000000
0	a : pours a murky chestnut brown with amber highlights near the edges . bottle gave a muted `` pop '' but not going on with the bubblies ; does n't offer more than a ring and a few swirls of carmel-colored head .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : hefeweizen like appearance . very hazy with floaters at bottom . lacking head size and retention . very faint off-white lace .	000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : pours a very pretty deep orange , copper ; very clear with tiny bubbles and a huge sticky white head . the head looks fluffy and it stays around for a while . the lacing down the sides of the glass would be artwork in any other setting . this is a great looking beer !	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : ebony body , big tan head with a nice ring of lace , looks pretty spot-on for the style	000000000000000000000
1	a : this ale from left hand bc pours a golden amber color , with an offwhite head . the retention on the glass is unlike anything i 've seen from a beer of this class . maybe i 'm just a nub though .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours an opaque brown body . the head on this one is massive . no joke , went to open this one and the cap pratically blew off , tons of foam , 5+ fingers . it was very pillowy and leaves a sticky head .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : softly tinted tawny yellow body with a clear , foamy white head that settles to a bubbly circle -- unappealing ...	00000000000000000000000
1	a : this pours an entirely transluscent orange color with red hues and a finger and a half of slightly off-white head that laces better than any beer i have ever seen .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : there is not too much better than a nitro'ed beer to look at . thick , rich creamy white head with tons of lacing . the body is brownish red and clear , though without much carbonation left .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : copper-brown color with a nice 1/2 '' head ; looks great when your pour it	00000000000000000

1	a : pours a dark golden yellow with a couple fingers worth of fairly oily looking bright white head that took its time fading into a thin film that left a pretty good layer of sticky lace down the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : brown-red color . minimal head and little carbonation movement ,	000000000000

1	a : looks perfect . deep murky copper color with a thick 1 inch white head that fades decently .	00000000000000000000
1	appearance : decent enough on the eyes , middle earth amber with some residual copper tones . slightly off-white head rises quickly and pops down to a broken covering . good conditioning .	000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : hazy copper with a one finger head that goes to a quick disk or foam . this one does not lace very well . not a great looking beer , looks more like one of my homebrews .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : almost opaque initially , but to the light a deep auburn . the head is insane , huge , dense vanilla cloud . incredible retention , eventually falling to a quarter-inch layer of froth . lace welded to the glasswall . impressive start .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : light brown pour with a good light tan head that leaves lace on the glass after about 1-2 fingers of head .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear , pale golden color with two fingers of fluffy white foam that diminishes to a quarter-sized berg . extensive speckled lacing remains on the glass and tiny bubbles rise in many steady streams through the column .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : poured a clear mellow amber with no head or lacing to speak of . a bit watery looking .	000000000000000000000
1	a : appearance is exceptional , great amber-red color to it with exceptional clarity ! nice 1 '' head that develops yet depletes half-way through . great lacing from the off-white to slightly tan head .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a deep brown , with smaller head and lower retention of that head . nothing overly special , though i suppose it 's on the prettier end of things as far as brown ales go .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : light orange in color , poured with approximately 1 '' of relatively thick off-white head . super cloudy with a ton of sediment . i do n't have a problem with sediment , but it 's not super attractive .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours almost pitch black with some deep ruby highlights around the edges , capped by a thin layer of mocha-colored head . retention is poor as the head dissipates almost immediately , leaving scant lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours like a golden champagne . huge bubbly head . crystal clear .	000000000000000
0	appearance : a light brown colour w/ little to no head to speak of . lacing is there which helps a little	0000000000000000000000
0	appearance : there is ( for obvious reasons ) painfully little head on the 2002 . i expect none so perhaps i 'm being too critical but i 've had other beers ( not this style ) that were aged longer and retained a nice head . otherwise ; the color is deep dark brown to the point of black with lovely ruby hues as it pours	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark opaque brown with a thin dark tan head that quickly reduced into a frothy film . there was a lot of particulate and white chunks floating around in the liquid that turned into a layer of sediment in the bottom of the glass that was thicker than the beers initial head . very off-putting . head quickly disappeared into nothingness leaving no lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : this beer poured a thin , weak head . the head subsided almost immediately into nothing . looking through the glass , i could see a faint haze swirling about in the honey-amber-copper color . i didnt notice too much carbonation at first glance , but the bubbles were thereyou just have to look for them .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : poured from the bomber into an aventinus broadly fluted 0.5l glass . absolutely pitch black from the middle of the fluted part down , with a gorgeous caramel brown cascading head up to the rim . excellent head retention and nice lacing . held directly in front of a bright bulb , no light passed through the pour . it just does n't get any better looking than this beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a nice copper-pumpkin orange . a little hazy . a slight creamy head , a little more color than the white foamy heads i 've seen on other pumpkin ales i 've tried . overall nice .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : seriously looks good , gold-amber . slightly cloudy head is thick but not a lot which is good . maybe a 1/2 '' white head .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours into my victory becker a clear , slightly bronzed gold color . the large-bubbled head is a shade darker than white and starts at over 3 fingers high on a turbid pour . it takes forever to shrink , eventually winding up at a solid cap .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a very hazy dark amber almost ruby color . not much head besides the thin egg shell colored film sitting on top of the beer .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a dark , black , almost pernicious looking brew , with a beautiful thick tan head .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : pale yellow , sadly too often the hallmark of a lame beer - not this one ! - with lots of yeasty bits at the bottom of the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : very lively , clear , beautiful orange/light amber color , borderline perfect head . lacing nice and thick , especially for how clear the beer is ( you would expect less head ) .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : dark apple cider , suspended sediment , no head , very slow and minimal rising carbonation . pond waterish	000000000000000000000
0	appearance : lightly hazed pale golden straw . very volatile , fleeting white head .	000000000000000
1	a : slightly cloudy , light amber with a pure white head . lacing that coats the glass and a heavy film left behind . decent carbonation to keep the head around after 2 years as well .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear golden honey that paints my palm in an amber hue , with a 1 1/2 finger of soapy white head that clings to the glass as the beer arches downward when the glass is tilted . dissipates to a bubbly film that lingers in the center of the brew .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : hazy , golden , orange with a white medium head with good retention . appears very effervescent . a little hazy . flavor : very bready malt flavor that gives way to a dry almost citrus rind flavor that lingers in the aftertaste . some spiciness from what could be a resiny american hop . a little floral and rose petals .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : this brew is classified and a standard american adjunct beer , and thas is exactly how is should be classified . it pours just like any of the hundreds of us domestic macrobrewery beers . no additional description is needed .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : red orange colour and a great 2 cm head that lasts very well . highly carbonated . 5	00000000000000000000
1	a : this 12oz bottle says it was bottled 12/18/2006 and cost $ 7.49 at my local beer emporium . it pours a rust-colored brown with a roasted 2-3 finger head . this looks as good as any of the big ipas made by stone , smuttynose and company .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a great dark golden-copper color with a solid two finger cream colored head that looks like it wants to stay around for a while .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : copper , brown body under a large slightly off white head . excellent lace and retention . great looking beer .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : bartender did not perfect pour this one for sure , but it still looked good	00000000000000000
0	a : musty brown , with a nice white head which did n't stick around as near as long as i 'd like . good colour once it was in the chalice .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : the beer is oddly golden in color for an american ipa . it pours clear with steady carbonation producing a good rocky white head . the head displays some pretty good retention and clumpy lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : great tawny head , near opaque in color	0000000000
0	a : yellow with a head that takes a while to `` foam down ''	000000000000000
0	a : black in color . a fairly aggressive pour yielded only one finger of light brown , frothy/creamy hybrid head with pathetic retention and absolutely no lacing . gi can make damn tasty stouts , but rarely make them look good . 4.0	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : the beer pours jet black into my snifter , thick but surprisingly shy in the head . the cap is about a half-a-finger , and a rich brown . the head falls fast , leaving brown splotches on the surface of the black brew .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : the head simply did n't produce more then a finger and it did n't stick around at all . the body boasts some nice clarity and slow carbonation but lacing is pretty much a non-issue .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : thick white foam that looks great in a frosted glass . color is very unique for a pilsner . it 's very pale yellow , almost looks like lemonade . not a whole lot of carbonation though , but it 's pretty thick . good carbonation after a sip .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a two finger head of nice cream and good thickness . retention is above average . black non-transparent colour . sm : caramel , nuts , and maybe some chocolate . certainly barley . overall , this is a light scent with difficult to detect notes , especially for me broken nose . all apologies , lads .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : completely black with a thick , luxurious light brown head . very nice looking beer in a great setting .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : out of the growler , into my glass . perfect , perfect hazy gold , inviting puffy head .	000000000000000000000
0	a : dark orange , very translucent . you can see that it 's quite fizzy . layer of golden foam quickly dissipates . almost no head , just a thin white layer of foam .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a robustly dark brown hue with dancing red highlights . the head is an off-brown color while it last ... leaving a slight bubbly film on top .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured into a tulip , leaves 3mm head throughout the session , light brown or burnt meringue in color . simple , but effective lacing . body is opaque , black-brown away from light , red-amber with orange highlights when held up to light . visible carbonation streams alongside glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a crystal clear red amber into a sam adams glass . the head is impressive though i 'm sure the etchings on the bottom of the glass helped . it starts at one finger and drops to a hearty collar and nearly full surface covering . looks great .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a bright golden yellow with a huge tuft of white foam atop , nearly 4-fingers . waited a couple minutes for enough head to winnow away , then continued the pour . beneath the crackling fizz , several streams of carbonation wriggle upward . eventually the head fades to a clinging patch of bubbles to one side . clarity is compromised by a dusting of silt . no lace .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : wow ! head galore ! tons of effervencense comes up through a beautiful hazy straw color .	0000000000000000000
1	a : bright straw body with an enormous rocky head of great retention . wonderful lacing and a thick rocky head . not quite perfect , but considering circulation it is a fantastic ambassador .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : cola black , some head , nice lace .	00000000000
0	appearance : very lightly colored . no head whatsoever apart from the first pour .	000000000000000
1	appearance : black which shows a clear ruby when backlit . had a creamy tan head that left a little bit of lacing . flavor : malty , but has a metallic aftertaste . basically has a porter profile .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : black as the darkest night with a mocha frothy head of foam and brilliant lacing . this is exactly how a great stout should look .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured into a pint class , good initial head with continuous lacing . cloudy orange color with a reddish tint .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dark amber body with a small head with pretty poor retention and very minimal lacing .	00000000000000000000
1	a : pours a black color with some deep brown around the edges . a nice head forms and sticks around . this leaves some pretty good lace down the glass . a very good looking porter .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pitch black . when you hold it up to the light , you can not see anything while in a pint glass . very dark head .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pale yellow with no head	0000000
1	appearance : a big , rocky , dirty white head of both large and small bubbles . chocolatey brown in the glass with burnt ochre around the edges , slightly cloudy from the sediment . loads of lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours brown with a really tall tan compact head that sets slowly into rich lacins .	000000000000000000
0	appearance : deep gold that looks too light for a bock in my opinion . nice white head , even from the 3rd or 4th pour from the growler , and nice rocky lace . flavor : focus on the malt , but none of the toasting i expect from most bocks . also has a nice spice note , a bit peppery , so it might just be the hops . rich malt taste but not sweet .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : cloudy orange amber with a big froth white head , damn good head retention with a bubbly rocky formation .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a deep carmelly red/brown with a big-ass foamy , frothy , sticky off-white head . a hurricane of fine carbonation is billowing up from the duvel `` d '' . leaves a root beer-esque curtain of foam on the glass wall . that 's about as good as it gets in my book .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : beautiful clear rich copper color with creamy tan head .	000000000000
1	a : distinctly black with a fluffy , pillowy 2 finger khaki head that resides to a one finger head . very impressive lacing .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : as soon as i started pouring this beer i was surprised by the color . it is much lighter than i expected ; a light straw color like almost like macro lager . only light head even with a decent pour .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : black , opaque , thin cover of dark tan leaves heavy lace in the heavy rogue goblet . flavor : roasted , but not burnt malt . no hop note but just a smooth drink with just a touch of astringency in the finish .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours an extremely pale straw color with a 1-finger fizzy white head , which subsides as fast as it developed .	00000000000000000000000
0	appearance : a rather orange-amber colored body , that reminded me of the color of home made barley-sugar boiled candies from my youth in england . a decent enough head forms reasonably easily at first , but this quickly disappears to leave a rather sad looking broken head , reminiscent of a pond scum . light inherent carbonation and no lacing whatsoever .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : near perfect looking golden , bubbly body under an inch and half worth of white head . good retention and some spotty lace .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear golden color with a medium sized white head . a pretty lively beer , lots of ascending bubbles .	0000000000000000000000
0	appearance : light , amaretto appearance with opaque honey edges . medium head , not too thick .	000000000000000000
1	a : pours a crystal clear amber color with a fluffy white head that sticks around for a long time . without a doubt one of the best looking ipas i 've had in a while .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : super deep brown color . poured with a finger of slightly brownish head . a touch of lacing as well . the head has great retention . when you fill your glass it snakes every time though .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : as poured the beer is a nice lightly hazed golden apricot color with a 1 fluffy off white head that leaves rings , legs and small patches of lacing as it recedes . sipping continues to leave patches and speckles of lacing for much of the beer . throughout there are lines and legs and small patches of lacing sticking to the sides of the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : nice half inch off-white head stuck with it for a bit . nice dark amberish color .	0000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear , dark golden color . it has a small , thin , white head that reduces to a small ring , and is pretty sticky . it is very still as a limited amount of carbonation is visible .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : opaque , deep copper brown color with a disappongtingly small tan head that quickly faded to a thin cap before disappearing completely .	0000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours hazy amber color with a fingertip 's worth of fizzy head that diminishes within moments . disappointing , because with a good head , this one could have been another classic from bell 's ( i suspect that it is , actually , but that trader joe 's does n't know how to treat their damn beer ! ) .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured from a bottle into a pilsner glass , this beer produces high carbonation and a fizzy white 1/4 '' or less white head that dissipated very quickly leaving very thin head lacing . it had a clear , sparkling straw colored body .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear light golden amber with a fingers width of sea foam white head . the head dissipates to a solid thick film and leaves a surprising amount of lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : usual nitro tap pour , with the cool inverse cascade effect . head remains present all the way through . most impressive is that lacing absolutely coats the entire glass top to bottom . guess this nitro actually worked . color is bronze .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a rich and frothy off white head with great lacing and retention . a clear amber appearance .	00000000000000000000
0	a : pours a slightly hazy golden color with a less than impressive head that quickly dissipates . specks of lacing slide down the glass after each sip .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours quite thick into a black body with a one-finger reddish-brown head with okay retention .	000000000000000000
1	a : pours clear golden with some small bubbles in the liquid . the large white head starts off thick but turns soapy after a little while . dissipation takes it 's time but leaves fantastic lacings .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a mahogany color , very very flat . has little floaties in it , not sure what thats all about . absolutely no head , no lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : nice red-orange color with a medium level of carbonation .	000000000000
0	a : half finger head of slight cream , decent thickness , and laughable retention - even for the high abv . colour is an appealing hazy dark copper with a sort of yeasty dust devil trailing about the bottom . sm : smell is strong : yeast , fermented sugar ( and maybe some unfermented - uh oh ) , caramelized malt , and perchance some fringe light fruit esters buried . me broken nose ca n't do much better than that , but i do note a lack of hops coming through in the scent . me companion notes a pineapply scent ; when i look for it i find it . it 's actually somewhere between proper pineapple and tepache , but without the bitterness of the latter .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a deep mahogany type brown and quite clear . a big fluffy tan head with good retention looks quite nice . some nice lacing is left and the head is very persistent . a little more carbonation evident than average . good looking pint .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a light amber colour . almost nothing in terms of carbonation trails , no lacing or anything of the sort .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : dark brown and reds blend into an opaque liquid topped by 4 fingers of off white head that paints the glass all the way until the end . a beautiful beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : clear amber in color sporting some orange highlights on the glass edge . nice 3 '' head lingers a while and produces some nice lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : cloudy amber/golden color with nearly no head .	0000000000
0	appearance : very nice bottle with gold trim around the top . pours an attractive golden color with virtually no head or lacing .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured into a pint glass . pretty attractive amber with an impressive head . enjoyable to look at in the glass .	000000000000000000000000
0	a : medium amber no head no bubbliness	00000000
0	a : i had to give this just a low score because of its complete lack of any head . i was n't really trying to pour it slowly either . i have a second bottle i will try a more aggressive pour with to see if there is any carbonation at all . one of my favorite parts of the style is typical frothy brown head that they have . otherwise it looks like others in the style . it could pass for a pint of oil due to its extremely dark color .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : straw in color , crystal clear , plenty of lacing , and a respectable head .	000000000000000000
0	a : pours a light purple color with a pink/white head this disolves quickly .	000000000000000
1	a : pours a deep amber with a rather thin head despite my rather rough pour . the head did last an abnormally long time however , a left a good amount of lacing down the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : nice bottle - interesting shape and colour . the beer itself pours a clear copper with minimal head .	000000000000000000000
0	a : copper-bronze , off-white head , no retention or lace .	000000000000
1	appearance : pours a very hazy apricot/orange color . great thick & foamy white head with excellent retention .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : medium carbonation , 1 inch head , dark brown	00000000000
1	a : pours a pretty much opaque burnt orange . huge frothy white head from the bottle conditioning , leaving lots of lace . great head retention .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : black in color sporting a two finger creamy head that lasted a long time . nice lace painted the glass .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : wow ... i must say i 'm quite amazed at the formation of the head on this thing . i could watch that all day . after it settles it leaves a 1/2in white creamy head . looks kind of like ice cream the body of the beer is black with some ruby highlights . the only thing keeping me from giving this a five is the fact that it really dos n't look like beer , more like a milkshake or something .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a murky reddish brown with a huge cream head . the head left lacing all up and down my glass .	000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this pours a maple brown , nearly mahogany , with an eggshell colored head that retains nicely . strangely light appearance for a double cda , though .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured a crystal clear honey color . very little head that diminishes right away , and little carbonation . seems thin and lifeless for a hefe . lacing ?	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : good frothing and great head retention , the pale amber hue shows an active carbonation and a brilliant clarity .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : 1.5 finger head of no cream , okay thickness , and bad ( ~30 second ) retention . cloudy yellow colour . sm : floral notes , lemon ester hops , and light orange peel . very witbier-y . a mild strength aroma .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : just a beautiful oktoberfest , thick 2-finger khaki head does n't even begin to recede for minutes , the beer is a deep orange-amber in color	0000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a dark reddish-brown color with a small off-white head that dissipates quickly and leaves behind no lave , but some foam floating on the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark rich black color with wonderfully thick cascading head . the appearance is outstanding !	00000000000000000
0	a : i gave this beer as vigorous a pour as i could manage , but i still came up with a small , foamy , peach-colored head , consisting mostly of big frothy bubbles , which died away steadily and obviously . it left only a pencil-thin line of lace at the edge of the glass . the body itself is a foggy auburn color . it is really tough to see through this brew , being that it is unfiltered . it 's colored like an old port , with rich magenta highlights . i get that the brewer wanted this to look raw and unfiltered , but the head was a big disappointment and it turned the beer into something resembling a sludge . i have to give low marks for appearance here .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours relatively clear for an imperial stout . produces a small , one finger medium-looking head that quickly fades to a wisp and ring . black body in the glass with some carbonation evident . only a ring remains until the end and leaves no real lacing down the glass . a little too light a pour and an average head at best . the '09 poured a little darker by comparison .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : bronze with an off-white head , exceptional retention & lace . plenty of yeast caked in the bottle .	000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a pale lemon/lemonade color with a hazy body full of carbonation and bubbles . head has good retention , about 2 fingers thick , with beautiful lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured from a 14.9 oz pub can into a pint glass , it does that whole nitrous cascade thing . body is dark brown -- bordering on black but not quite there -- with ruby hues on the edges when held to the light . a 1-finger creamy , foamy beige/khaki-colored head sits atop the body and is well-retained . leaves lots of splotches of foamy lacing on the side of the glass -- almost a wall of foam , really -- and some solid rings as well when i let it sit still long enough to settle in one place .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : standard clear straw yellow , very quick forming head , and quick to dissipate , lots of carbonation .	000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours out dark brown and flat . a few bubbles form , but no head . black body and no carbonation evident . this always disappoints , and unfortunately it 's hit or miss with de molen 's h & v line .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pour is dark chocolate with brown edges . perfect two-finger tan head . bubbles slowing bursting on the tan surface . no visible carbonation in the body .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : it pours a pale yellow color with some cloudy clarity at best . there was a pop when i removed the cork put it poured really close to dead flat . no head with some small bubbles hitting the surface .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : when poured into a mug , the beer was a light golden color with a fizzy head of white foam . i did n't know how big the head of foam was because it just dissipated away too fast . it left a couple of rings and no lace around the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : pours a dark black with a massively thick mocha head that seems to last forever ... excellent lacing throughout .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this was a very dark , ruby-brown lager with a light tan head . it rose up to almost two fingers and then disappeared quickly . a thin layer of foam was left capping the beer , leaving a decent amount of lace behind .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : small head that sticks around with good lacing atop a clear straw colored body .	00000000000000000

0	a : clear , amber/orange with a smaller white head , minimal retention and lace . 3/5	00000000000000000
1	appearance : light colored with a small white head that faded quickly . this left almost no lace .	0000000000000000000
1	a : bright red with an even keel of carbonation rising to fluffy beige head . gorgeous head does n't waver for a moment . i have n't seen a beer do this in on of my glasses for a while .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a dark tan head sits atop a black-brown body . pock marked head holds strong @ 2 fingers . long lasting and nice to look at .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : like the can , it 's golden - a blander , paler version of the can design . very clear , with very steady carbonation . head is a half-fingered fizzle of white , tapering off in seconds before disappearing altogether . like the head , lace is non-existent .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : holy head . bubbled up too fast to finish the pour . 3 1/2 fingers of white head with huge bubbles . fat bubbly lacing too . it actually makes the top of the glass look kind of messy , since it does n't dissipate evenly . the beer itself is orange and has a bit of a haze to it .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours an amber red with hints of orange fairly transparent . head forms at two fingers , lots of bubbles that fade quickly to a thin foam on the surface . zero lacing whatsoever .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a cloudy light orange look , what a great color . very consistent , the clouds dont float around its extremely cloudy all over rather than in spots .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a slightly cloudy amber/copper color with 3 huge fingers of head that fade very slowly leaving tons of sticky lacing behind .	0000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : very dark brown to black with ruby hilites . a creamy tan head that builds copiously and diminishes equally quickly to a thin layer of cream , lacing the glass and just covering the surface . neither turbid nor opaque , but clear where visible . flavor : bitter up front comingled with dry roast . the subtlest hints of bitter chocolate . no esters , no fruitiness or sweetness of any sort . lager character is whistle clean , leaving only malt and hop character to stimulate the taste and palate . the finish is dry . the overall taste experience is similar to that of the dry stout guinness minus the creamy mouthfeel .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : golden pale with crazy good head retention , nice and cloudy , i can see some yeasty floaties . huge champagne like carbonation .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a cascading nitro-foamy head in a black background . the head eventually settles into a bueatiful 2 inch creamy cap that stays with the beer all the way to the end . the beer itself appears black at first blush , but upon close inspection is actually a very deep ruby/mahogany . it is a gorgeous beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours a hazy ( from the yeast ) pale golden amaber with a creamy tightly packed one inch bone white head . the particulates that are floating in hear create a nice looking cloudy plumage that , to me at least , compliments both the color of the beer itself as well as the head , which does not last as long or leave as much lacing as i would have liked .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : opaque faded-straw colored body with a thin white head with little lacing .	000000000000000
1	appearance : copper in color , a little darker than i expected , almost reddish . a nice half-inch head rests on top and it seems to be hanging in there pretty good .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : looks nice , deep ruby amber , solid creamish head . not clear , but consistent opacity .	00000000000000000000
1	a : pours a slightly hazy , pale gold ; snowy white , 1-inch head leaves some specks of lace and manages some thin foamy retention .	000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pretty much clear . a slight yellow tinge , but pretty much transparent . no head , no nothing .	0000000000000000000000
1	a : first pour yielded a crisp and bright clarity of brassy coloring with a strong and rapid sense of misty carbonation bubbles wavering towards the surface . the second pour released all that rich yeasty nutrient creating a cloudy haze of pale lemon coloring with a pea-soup clarity . the head is marshmellow fluff both in color and structure , holding strong . the lacing was equally strong , thick and clumping with spongy patches on the chalice walls .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : hazy amber brown with a good amount of chunky sediment and thick creamy khaki head that wo n't recede . it looks like a cappuccino really : tan head with some dark streaks from the sediment passing through .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : served with a fluffy , half inch head that does not dissipate ( it 's only gone after being drank ) . hazy light amber , with a huge wall of lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured a cloudy , pale yellow with plenty of carbonation discharged . the head took a few moments to build into a two-finger , white head .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours black with about an eighth of an inch dark brown head that quickly disappeared into a thin collar leaving just a dot or two of lace .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : clear pale straw color with a surprisingly large and foamy white head that dissipates rather slowly and leaves heavy lace .	00000000000000000000000
0	appearance : foam starts creeping up the neck after opening . brown pour makes a huge , three finger , thinner looking , chunky , crackly , light brown head . chunky with lots of pot holes like swiss cheese . very noisy too . black body and higher levels of carbonation for the style . head eventually fades to a thin foam cap and leaves some lacing down the sides . that 's its only saving grace . other than that , it 's nasty looking .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a clear mahogany even when the bottle is swirled ( no yeast ? ) with a meager one finger of off-white head that completely vanishes with no lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : amazing , witth a light brown head that initially takes up the entire glass . after two minutes the head disappated to about three fingers . if you get this on nitro watch as the head melts into one of the best beers you 've ever had .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : 3 fingers of bumpy frothy ivory head all over a translucent amber . incredible whipped retention and lacing everywhere . this is an awesome looking beer !	00000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured with a big white foamy head that dissipated to a thin layer on top leaving no lacing . the beer is slightly cloudy with a yellow golden color .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a clear pale , golden yellow color with a fluffy white head ; some lacing	000000000000000000
0	appearance : clear and dark orange amber color . not bright and vivid like mirror pond , not at all cloudy . head was some what reluctant , white and thin with decent retention .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours an extremely dark brown with a little bit of light passage when the glass is held to a lamp . there is about a 1 finger creamy looking head with decent retention and some lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured with vigorous carbonation and head , bubbled throughout the tasting . very clear , very pale yellow . looks like macroswill to be honest . but i guess thats what its supposed to be..	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a very dark brown with a fizzy and bubbly soda-like head that quickly fizzes away to nothing . no lacing at all with a completely flat surface .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : poured into a pint glass . first thing noticed is the sediment in suspension . lots and lots of chunks suspended in the mahogany-amber body . small tan head disappears fast .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : golden in the body . amber colored closer to the top of the beer . i prefer my dipa 's to be more amber than blonde , but that is just a personal preference . a nice two finger head as died down leaving some nice lacing reminding me of where the head began .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured a milky orangy and yellowish hazy color , typical of hefeweizens , especially authentic german ones . yielded a huge 3 finger creamy head that came right out of the glass but maintained its shape is it was thick and creamy .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : as i pour this beer into my glass , i am surprised by the lack of head build-up . i poured more vigorously , but that only helped a little . the finger-thick white head crackled away almost instantly , disappearing to nothing . i have seen better heads on most light beers . the body itself was surprisingly hazy . a deep golden color , and an abundant amount of active carbonation kept this beer from an `` awful '' rating .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : a stunning deep brown near black with cranberry highlights . a inch of toasted head comes after a medium pour . the head slowly fades to an impressive 1/3 inch . what 's this ? lacing on a dark beer ? now it has my full attention . the lacing is out of this world .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear yellow body , as expected but the head is fizzzy white , , a little lower than expected ( ~1 cm max ) and has no retention nor lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : thick and heavy . some bright , spiced tangerine balanced against sun-soaked , wet hay . alcohol is present , but hidden surprisingly well for such high content . raisins did come out as it warmed .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours opaque jet black with a formidable tan head -- nice retention . impressive lacing as well .	00000000000000000000
1	appearance : very slightly hazy amber/reddish with an initial 1/2 inch head that drifts down to a wisp that just covers the top of the beer and leaving some attractive lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : brilliant crystal-clear golden with a large head that dies down quickly but is easily roused .	000000000000000000
1	appearance : huge foamy head , light brown in color . very dark brown , with ruby highlights , almost opaque . clarity is very good in the highlights . flavor : dark malt flavors dominate up front : light chocolate and coffee . not roasty in any way , just dark malts . malt flavors seem somewhat muted , so i 'm thinking this example is a bit old and oxidized . hop bitterness is low , ibu about 20 . very light hop flavors . body &	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pours dark brown . very thin ivory head with some emerging carbonation flowing to the top . fairly lackadaisical .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : cloudy golden color ( very cloudy on the second ) . surprisingly , the head was modest and it did n't last long .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a light golden color with a big white head that does not quickly dissipate .	000000000000000000
1	a : copper and crystal clear , with a nice 2 finger tan head that lasts a long time and laces nicely . ca n't think of a better way for an ipa to look .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : well , this one scores some serious points for the head of this beer . solid thumb and a half of head that laces and retains like crazy . however , usually i would expect a red beer , to be ... well red . this is more of an orange , leaning closer to lager yellow then red . good clarity though .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : very dark , pretty well impenetrable until held to a strong light - then richer mahogany shows ( not quite 'black ' , but close enough ) . ridiculously gargantuan head , nearly 4 fingers of pillowy khaki creampuff that falls steadily but stays lumpy ; terrific lace in jigsawed fragments .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : golden color .	00000
0	a : this see-through piss-water looks like a glass of white wine . some foam boiled up initially but there was zero retention and minimal lacing .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a frothy ring of white that dissapates down to a layer of bubbles hugging the side of the glass . beer is a semi cloudy bright orange . lacing is not existent .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : this brew pours a translucent dark gold with a reddish cast . it almost looks like a glass of honey topped with a white foamy head .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : wow . beautiful golden hay colored with huge fluffy white head that fills up the westy glass that she brought me too ! head fades down over a minute . hazy .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : almost jet black , with the faintest hints of brown-purple coming through the bottom edge of the glass when held to light . the stream of beer coming out of the bottle even looked impressive ! semi-firm tan head , tight bubbles , settles to a sheer cap . more sheeting than lacing on the sides of the glass at first , but toward the end the lacing is incredible !	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pure black body , wispy tan head that dissipated immediately .	0000000000000
0	appearance : pours a very fizzy , thin , bubbly , soapy looking , white head with lousy retention . cloudy amber orange in color with lots of carbonation , even for a weizen . head quickly fades to a thin , bubbly film with loads of fizzing carbonation all over the top . only a ring remains until the end leaving zero lacing down the glass . looks like an ugly weizen really .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : for me he appearance of the draught upon pour does it for me . it really sets up the whole experience to follow , and perhaps brings me back when i otherwise would n't . cascading clouds settle into a perfect looking glass of beer , dark with beautiful thick creamy head .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : dark black color , with big chocolate brown head , medium carb	00000000000000
0	appearance : this beer purports to be a dunkelweizen , but does n't look like it . it 's dunkel , of course , but has that same yeast-laden , unfiltered appearance of a ( shudder ) widmer `` hefeweizen '' . no head to speak of , and the beer looks somewhat lifeless . i 'm a little concerned at this point .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : murky , dark pink color , nil head . pretty unusual ...	00000000000000
0	appearance : poured into a pint glass with a sprinkle of salt at the bottom , per the label 's instructions . golden , clear , straw body ; pitiful white , fizzy head that has trouble forming and even more trouble retaining . points for novelty awarded for the whole peppercorns that slip from the bottle and fall to the bottom of the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours brown with a mild white head , no real lace , average head retention .	000000000000000000
1	a : this beer pours a straw yellow with a two finger of creamy head . head recedes quickly leaving thick sheets of lacing on the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : small head that quickly fades to nothing , thick thick thick oil that coats the walls of the snifter - exactly what an ris should look like . perfect .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : super-thick , rich , creamy , mostly white foamy head . dissipates slowly leaving loads of lacing . in fact , the head was so thick that this small 300 ml bottle would n't fit into my imperial pint glass without waiting for some of the head to thin out .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : mama mia ! poured a deep , uber cloudy orangish color with good carbonation leaving a nice white cap	000000000000000000000
1	a : clear golden yellow color . first pour yielded about 6 fingers of creamy/frothy hybrid head with ( unfortunately really good retention and lots of lacing . 3.0	00000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours what would be a clear , golden body except for all these baby sea monkey-like particles . frothy , snow white head .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : thank god with the help of the cellarman and barman it pours a pint of heavenly nectar~~ white , tight frothy head on top of a pale amber hued nectar , very low carbonation just like a cask-conditioned ale should be . the beer head settles to a 1cm thick layer of creamy foam and stays forever ( i mean throughout the drink ) , leaving incredibly tight and creamy lacing ... this is a dream for a cask-conditioned ale , right in front of me , really .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : hazy amber with active carbonation . a soapy copper tinged head starts out very strong , but recedes to a ring at the beer 's edge fairly quickly . leaves a little lace .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear light goldenrod body with a fleeting one finger off-white head .	00000000000000
0	a : this beer poured a nice , brown-red colour . i was glad that the colour was nice to look at because the head barely bothered to make an appearance . it was small , and left in what seemed like an instant .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours absolutely perfect ! cloudy , creamy orange body with a glorious mountain of head that fills just to the edge of the glass and hangs around until the glass is empty .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : typical adjunct pale and clear yellow body with circumferential white head that disspaeared quickly . no lacing .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : golden yellow color . very thin layer of foam upon pouring , disappeared in a few seconds . no lacing .	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a thick , gloupy black and then cascades out an amazing amount of dark tan head that haves great retention and is very creamy looking .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear , medium pumpkin body with a fleeting one finger off-white head .	000000000000000
0	a : two finger foamy head . cloudy and nearly white in color . seriously , only a little yellow tinge .	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : dark brown to black , almost opaque . pouring leaves a thick tan head that takes a while to go away and an island of foam that remains the entire time .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours with an average size head that dimishes quickly into a film . the body is a murky medium dark tawny brown , almost completely opaque . streamers line the edge of the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : kind of a muddy reddish brown with some soap khaki head . not a very pretty brew .	00000000000000000000
1	a : very dark , if held up to a light it has a thin thin thin line of a dark ruby red color that surrounds the glass like a halo . head looks very much like a tan fluffy cloud .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : sort of hazy ( unfiltered beer ) golden color with orange highlights . the head is off white and bubbly , like a champagne . cakey top part of the head and lots of sticky lace left on the sides of the glass .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a clear reddish brown with golden highlights into a shaker pint glass . the head barely forms and at its height is a thin collar with a very small bubbly patch . i expected a bit more .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : bright , clear golden color . poured a 4 finger fluffy white head with excellent retention . decanted lightly . laced in rings and patches .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : poured slightly darker than a budweiser , but i could only tell when i held it right next to a bud . had no head but that 's no doubt the bartender 's fault .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours an extremely pale straw yellow with a thin white head . the head does n't linger even with the the slow and steady carbonation .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours golden orange with an extremely long lasting rocky white head with nice belgian lace .	000000000000000000
0	a : a hazy orange colour with a big , big , big head . this beer is carbonated to the point of ridiculousness . it actually took me over 15 minutes to pour a 500ml bottle into a pint glass - the first attempt had the glass more than half full of foam .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours an attractive caramel sunburst with a solid 2 finger dirty butter crown that shows moderate retention and good lace .	00000000000000000000000
0	a : pale light yellow .	000000
1	a : pours a beautiful rich dark coffee black , the head rises up after the pour to an awesome 2 fingers of light chocolate colored white . the carbonation appears to be nice , and the retention of the head is good , as is the lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours with a massive amount of head , ca n't even pour the bottle in one try . the surface tension is such that i can pour so the head is an inch or more over the rim of the glass . the head finally settles down to about 2 fingers of pillowy and dense tan foam . awesome lacing . the beer itself is black as black can be , without even a hint of any other color around the edges . no sediment in the bottle .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : nice golden amber color wiht a frothy toasty finish	00000000000
1	a : pours a redish gold color with a 1 finger pinkish white head . excellent retention , minimal lacing .	000000000000000000000
1	appearance : from the tap , peter 's klsch pours a translucent pale yellowish copper color . there was a decent sized bone white head atop this beer . well , it is a decent sized head considering the size of the glass ( .2l ) . it did leave some spotty lacing on the inside of the glass . basically when i think of the perfect klsch served in its proper glassware , this is what i picture .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : hazy amber with a lace like houdini , now you see it and now you do n't . sediment stays on the bottom of the bottle quite well .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours brown with amber highlights . no appreciable effervescence or lacing . the head initially stands a couple inches high , but quickly falls to a skim .	000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : now this is one phenomenal looking beer , i rarely am a 5 person but this one ca n't really improve at all . its a completely opaque black hole abyss that swallows up any rays of light 's chance at entering . the head was ludicrous in the sense that it was a gigantic 3.5 finger length soapy frothy of a tan head that leaves legs as it walks all over my pint glass . looks like an over boiled pot of pasta with a tan hue .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : wow . gahhh . what a beautiful beer . the widget gives it an incredible head right out of the can . when i popped the can open the carbonation shot out . pouring it was like pouring rich , creamy chocolate milk . it settles in the glass with a creamy brownish white head that persists for ages and carbonation swirling around in the most beautiful pattern , as if this beer was alive . once that settles , a deep , dark brown colour takes over that is almost opaque , save for around the sides . head is small but very creamy and stays around forever .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : attractive drink on the pour , looks like a lighter , creamier guinness pint from a good tap . huge head and flowing bubbles . huge head for the whole beer , strongest aspect of this one . nitro does this justice .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : 5 |	0000
1	a : overflowing light tan head upon aggressive pour . clear , dark ruby red . great head retention . too much head at first is only negative	0000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : ridiculously , almost impossibly clear - pale gold/orange - minimal head , nice lacing	0000000000000000
0	a : a dull , chestnut brown color . head starts promising , but diminishes to a rim of reddish/white foam .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : this looks like a light apple cider with all sorts of gunk in it .	00000000000000000
0	a : oh , man , this is not going well i wasnt anticipating a bottle-conditioned ipa , and my carelessness has resulted in a disgusting kaleidoscope of chunks throughout the cloudy light-amber body . the head , however , is a thing of beauty : 2 inches of light , frothy , creamy white foam . great retention , lots of lace . its a bit of a trade-off , i suppose , since if id poured less enthusiastically there wouldnt be so much sediment , but there wouldnt be such a gorgeous head , either . the bodys a 1 , the heads a 5 , ill split the difference and give it a 3 .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a vigorous 4 finger creamy white head with excellent retention . brew itself is a semi-cloud pale orange yellow with beautiful carbonation . lacing is amazing considering the light body , with layers clinging to the side of the glass like a ruler .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a golden amber color with light copper edges against the light . has a frothy off-white head that retains pretty well at a fingers ' thickness , and deposits nice lacing down the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : looks beautiful . jet black stout , brown creamy head pours thick with a thin half finger head . creamy creamy creamy	000000000000000000000000
0	a : semi copper and clear . thin , tan head that dissipates quickly .	000000000000000
0	appearance : tawny brown , quite hazy , thinnish layer of tan frothy foam , ok head retention	000000000000000000
0	a : poured a cloudy amber with 1-finger head that dissipated quickly . some lacing , but not much .	00000000000000000000
1	a : pours a clear copper/amber with two fingers worth of creamy off white head . it had a great cascading effect during the pour , so much that it looked like a nitro can pour . settles to a thick creamy cap and left walls of thick lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pitch black . may be the blackest black i have ever seen . creamy mocha head . nice lacing down glass .	000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : hazy orange in color with a thick bubbly off white eggshell head . gorgeous presentation especially in a decorated glass german stein .	0000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a bit 3+ finger thick tight off-white head with great retention . perfectly clear with higher active levels of carbonation . burnt orange in color . head slowly fades to a thick foam cap that stays and leaves lots of nice lacing down the glass . looks great all the way .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the body appears nearly black , and shows a clear ruby brilliance when held up to light . above this is a lovely 2-finger head of dense light-brown foam that shows mediocre retention and nice lacing . great looking brown , and only the sub-par retention kept it from getting a perfect score .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this was a clear coppery amber color . it was served to me with a medium sized head that faded fairly quickly .	0000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : brownish , slightly hazy , billowous tan head at first but with poor head retention ( just leaves a thin film with a few `` islands '' )	000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very cloudy , much more so than an average wheat beer . the head was almost nonexistent , but had decent lacing for whatever was there .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this beer has the darkest head i have seen . i would describe the head as dirt brown . nice retention and nice lacing . the beer itself is black .	000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : deep brown , not quite black under a nice sized tan head . excellent lace and retention .	00000000000000000000
1	a : clear reddish-amber color . semi-fizzy white head was n't too big , but retained for quite a while .	000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a translucent amber color with an eggshell hued , fizzy thin head .	0000000000000000
1	appearance : free pour yields a 3/4 inch fluffy white head that dissipates steadily leaving swatches of lacing along the side of the glass ( as does the beer itself ) . pours a semi-translucent brownish red .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : really nice copper , tons of yeast sediment floating around	000000000000
1	a : two fingers of sea-foam-esque froth , barely off white in color , tops this brew but rushes to depart and leaves only traces of its existence . the body is a rich and robust copper that glows brilliantly when held to the light . astonishingly clear .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : another exceptionally crappy sprecher head - actually no , there is no head to speak of . the beer just looks like apple juice . this is completely unacceptable for the style .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : clear straw gold	00000
0	a : dark brown body with a bit of light penetrating at the edges , but not through the center . a bit of head is an understatement , considering half the bottle was head .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : brownish amber color , crystal clear , small 1 finger head with no lacing and little retention .	00000000000000000000
1	a : great appearance , deep copper color with incredible full head all the way to the bottom of the glass	000000000000000000000
1	a : clear ruddy chestnut body under an inch of soft tan foam . good retention and some spotty lace . i love the color .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear with a slight haze . golden orange . really a very beautiful color . lots of bubbles and frothy white head like a boss ! 4.5	00000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : following the above instructions on the bottle , i amused myself for quite some time rolling this bomber around . when i finally got down to pouring , the beer came out a very cloudy yellow . cloudy to the point that my hand was just an indistinct , fuzzy shadow when viewed through the glass . the head rose up to two fingers with an aggresive pour and disappeared quickly . it did n't leave any lace on the glass and quickly became just a ring around the top of the beer .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured a dark brown with a nice brown head . lots of bubbles and lacing but poured a bit thin	0000000000000000000000
1	appearance : nice maple syrup/caramel bronze , it matched really well with the polished bronze colored bar where i was sitting . the head was creamy at almost nitro pour density levels with thick patches and nice stratified rings around the pint .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : poured into a mug from a 22 ounce bomber . is a black glass of darkness that is slightly brown around the edges . it does have a light brown head that is about two fingers thick .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : warm pale yellow color . very clear . a little bit of white fine bubbled head that dissipates quickly and has negligible lacing . flavor : very light and malt profile like pale or pilsner malts . hop bittering is fairly light - a bit of indistinguishable noble hop character . very slight carbonate profile , like mineral water - though it could be partly from the carbonation . balances and nothing stands out in the finish .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : pours a deep gold with a wispy , off-white head .	0000000000000
0	a : pours a crystal clear yellow with a minimal white head , some retention , no lace .	0000000000000000000
0	a : bronze , amber hue .. not much head or lacing . kind of lackluster .	00000000000000000
0	appearance : a very transparent , light caramel color , with a hint of amber . pours with a small head that dissipates quickly , leaving a collar around the glass for the first few sips . almost no lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : traditional motor oil black , very viscous looking . really cool dark brown head , darker than most . this goes away quickly leaving a very thin sheet of lace .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : had this on tap at the bayern taproom . poured a mahogany color , slightly cloudy . not much head , no lacing .	00000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : clean , clear golden body . nice big creamy head that lasted . very nice looking .	0000000000000000000
0	appearance : the can itself is average . easily the best part . the beer ? i have no idea . i imagine it is a black hole , sucking the soul out of everything around it .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : beautiful hazed orange with honey lemon corners . a huge 3 finger off white crown with loads of retention and lace . the crown is really frothy and gets nice and dense like whipped cream after you let it settle and repour a few times . this is what i want my ipa 's to look like .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : deep dark brown , no head retention	000000000
1	a : the pour is a deep dark brown , essentially black , with a fluffy tan head .	0000000000000000000
1	a : 3 finger sustained head for several minutes which slowly went down to a 4 mm sustained head after about 10 minutes . plenty of lacing . head is a off-white , but mainly brown/caramel in color . beer is super dark with a hint of red .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured into standard pint glass from 12oz bottle . this beer looks amazing in the glass . extremely rich orangish-copper hue . it is unfiltered and murky , with little yeasty how-ya-doin 's floating around throughout the glass .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : standard pour reveals a 1.5 finger creamy , powdery colored pastel pink head with moderate retention . beer is a semi-cloudy red rose . no lacing whatsoever .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : gentle pour yields no head , just a thin white wisp atop a clear , goldenrod brew . lacing is spotty and with no real cling . not a real looker though a more vigorous pour probably would 've help .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : boring , crystal clear yellow-orange . white , fleeting head . lame .	000000000000000
1	appearance : as poured the beer is clear copper/bronze color with a `` white head that soon recedes to a thin patch of foam , a ring around the glass and some thick foam sticking to the sides of the glass . sipping spreads the foam and leaves areas of scattered speckles of lacing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : gold bullion , crystal-clear yellow lager body with a tall , rough , spittly , and ultimately unimpressive white head .	00000000000000000000000
1	appearance : clear gold with a mammoth head , slow fading , lightly hazed body . looks good .	0000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a clear , pee colored beer and shows off a 3 '' head that is off-white . carbonation flies to the top of the beer . pretty good retention . tentacles of foamy lace remain on the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pitch black with a rich , light brown head . looks fantastic ! the head leaves plenty of lace after a couple of minutes .	000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear pale yellow , trace head , no lacing	00000000000
0	a : thin head ; good carbonation ; dark cola color ; not much lacing	000000000000000
1	a : four finger wonderful tan had of lovely cream , brilliant thickness , and great retention . very dark brown-black colour . i 'm looking foward to this one . sm : roasted caramelized malt , light bacon ( far lighter than schlenkerla anyway ) , and maybe some nuts . difficult to discern with me broken nose ; all apologies .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours golden-apricot in color , viscous , with a fluffy , cavernous , 2-inch head that leaves thick patches of lacing everywhere . slightly opaque with a chilled haze , this brew looks damn inviting .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : translucent golden orange with almost no head .	0000000000
1	a : i love the color ; a hazy gradient of orange and red hues that is literally shining in my glass , it would make a perfect sunset . beautiful .	00000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a deep , hazy plum body that resides beneath a three-finger head of creamy pinkish-tan foam ; good retention and tons of lace . probably the best-looking barleywine i 've seen . beautiful .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : very dark brown bordering on black body with clear garnet edges . a good size foamy espresso head made for a difficult pour from the tap but could very well be due to a highly carbed keg . not sure if that 's going to translate to the bottle version . as the head and beer disappear from the glass , good sheets of lacing are left . the body could be darker for a higher score here , but the lacing is exceptional for the style . let 's average the score and call it a 3/5 .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : amber brew , moderately carbonated , tan head of fairly dense bubbles	00000000000000
0	a : the stout , on first look , poured murky and black with a half a finger of tan head . that murkiness disguised a rather disgusting clump of yeast that looked like a hairball . thankfully it was n't in my glass ( sorry janlud ) , but it was fuckin ' gross . that cost the appearance big-time , as i spent the rest of my night peering ominously into my snifter looking for hairballs .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : damn , duvel always looks greats , especially sitting in a duvel tulip glass . this beer poured a hazy , pale yellow with a stark white head that lept up out of the liquid . it easily reached over three fingers , even with a careful , down-the-side-of-the-glass pour . as it settled , it gave new meaning to the word rocky . it became an uneven landscape of dense , white foam and coarse bubbles . it took a very long time to dissipate , and never really disappeared since it was being fed from below by the `` bead from hell . '' the streams of bubbles were so strong and numerous that it seemed as though gas was being forcibly injected into the bottom of the beer . an incredible amount of sticky lace was left behind . beers just do n't look any better than this .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : kind of a pale yellow to cold and a little cloudy . thick white cloudlike head made of small bubbles ... some lacing , but poor retention ... just disappears on me	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : srm is dark brown/black . opaque . head is tan , 1 in , dissipates to 1 cm and is semi-puffy , but when it settles is very creamy , almost looks like a nos pour . medium carbonation . medium lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a wan yellow with a small , snow-white head ; no retention or lacing . aroma ; as with most macros , largely clean -- albeit with faint traces of cooked corn or the like .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : nice sticky lacing on top of a amber brown body . nothing remarkable .	0000000000000000
0	a : the beer looks very similar to iced tea in my glass ; it 's orange-ish in appearance , with bits of sediment suspended throughout . the head quickly dies away , and i 'm seeing no lacing whatsoever .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pour is a bright , sunlit orange with a huge head and some scary floaters .	000000000000000000

0	a : pours a deep , reddish copper with a modest beige head that dissipates in short order . lacing is minimal .	00000000000000000000000
1	a : standard pour yields a billowy 2.5 finger light creamsicle colored head with very good retention . beer is a clear light mahogany . lacing is patchy and spotty with nice cling .	0000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : perfect look for a belgian ale . deep dark ruby color like an iced tea . 1 inch off-white head that fades slowly leaving a white puff on the top of the brew .	000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : disinguishes a very cloudy amber color with orange shades , ephemeral foamy head , i like the logo , look 's like a picasso painting ;	0000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : pours a slightly cloudy amber color . i expected the color to be lighter . there is just under a finger of off white head that goes away completely .	00000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : pouring into a tulip glass from the growler purchased yesterday at portsmouth brewery , the alt is surprisingly headless . other than that it is a gorgeous ruby red hue . from the lack of head and carbonation it sits still similar to a red wine .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dark black . opaque , not light gets through this one . no head . i swirl it and i get a little , but it goes away fast . looks like a cup of joe . that 'd be great if this thing was n't supposed to be beer .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : a ton of yeast floating around . very cloudy and dirty red color . a small white head and not much lace .	0000000000000000000000000

0	a : opaque ( i.e. , seriously muddy ) orange body with a thin , quickly dissipating tan head . looks like raw mango milk , if such a thing exists . not something i find terribly appealing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : very hazy orange-copper . minimal head with some lacing .	000000000000

0	a : deep black under a small tan head . no lace , no retention .	0000000000000000
0	appearance : entering my glass is a straw yellow brew with a frothy snow-white one finger head . the foam dissipates almost instantly , leaving some random blotchy lace . on the bottom of the glass is a layer of bubbles , rocketing their way one by one towards the surface .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : rustic copper with a central cap and confluent ring of light peanut . hazy . fleeting spot lace . dark and murky for the style .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : golden but a little `` muddy '' , probably yeast as it smells belgian yeast . the head is enourmous if you pour the liquid clucking through the bottle the head is white and quite creamy when it settles in .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : solid black body topped with three full fingers of rich , dense , medium-brown head that just barely poke above the rim of the glass ; incredibly persistent retention and a practically solid sheet of lacing . maybe i just have a soft spot for imperial stouts , but this is about the third beer of this style i 've given a 5 for appearance . i just could n't imagine this looking any better .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	appearance : the beer poured a pretty clear slightly reddish orange with a very large ( 2 '' + ) head after a moderate pour . there were lots of bubbles rising to maintain the head . this is probably one of the most carbonated sa beers that i have had away from the brewery .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : nice cloudy golden color with a medium head .	00000000000
1	appearance : huge head that 's refusing to decline . it started to bubble over the glass , or seemed like it was going to , with all the carbonation pushing the head up from the middle of the glass . once the carbonation settles the head looks a bit thicker , an off-white slight tan color , crazy lacing , thick and clumpy . color 's a beautiful dark amber .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : pours a one finger medium but `` light '' looking light brown head with decent retention . black with medium carbonation evident , some of which decorates the top once the cap has settled . head slowly fades to a thin wisp and a ring . film eventually disappears leaving a thin ring and no lacing down the sides . average for the style .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : the beer is a super hazy copper color with a head that dissipated insanely fast . the head is slightly off white , i think it really went away before i could even take note of it . if there is no head i am not happy . just horrible appearance overall .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : orange colour and a huge 4 cm head that sticks around due to the high carbonation . 5	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : the body has a very bright golden yellow color with brilliant clarity and some visible carbonation . from the pour it makes a small white head which quickly vanishes , leaving only a thin ring around the edge of the glass and a film island of foam floating in the middle of the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : very vigorous pour creates a 1 finger coarse , off-white head that dissipates very quickly . beer is a muddy , cloudy reddish-brown clay . lacing is very spotty to non-existent and with no stick .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : harsh pouring reveals a generous 2 '' head that lasts quite a long time . deep copper and ruby colored beer waits inside the glass . the head is tan with tiny bubbles that leaves a bit of lace behind .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : cloudy amber color with a decent creamy head that left decent lacing and remained throughout .	000000000000000000
0	a : pours a yeasty , hazy brown with a fizzy white head , very good retention , but not a lot to look at , very unfiltered .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : clear , medium amber color with one finger of persistent white foam head of fine bubbles . moderate lacing remains . the bottled version appeared more red in color , the head diminished quickly , and no lacing remained .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : crystal clear pale yellow with a thin ring of lace that has trouble staying around .	000000000000000000
0	a : light straw color and crystal clear . two fingers of soapy head that falls quickly , even in a flute . not really any lacing going on . 4.5	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a one finger head of amazing cream , brilliant thickness , and incredible retention ( over six minutes before i could n't wait any longer ) for the style . semitransparent ruby colour . incredibly appealing . sm : bright light fruit esters . very pleasant . raspberry , cherry . a bit musty , but it 's three years old . yeasty . a moderate strength aroma .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : dark for an ipa . really nice lacing	0000000000
0	a : opaque shitty brown color . some crap floating around . could n't build up much of a head and then poor retention and little lacing . 4.5	00000000000000000000000000000
1	a : a modest pour generated a black body and a massive head of over two fingers . the head was dense and sticky . the head lingered on and on and on and supported a curtain of lace that could not hold the side of the glass due to the high abv .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : transparent	000
1	a : i really like the appearance of this beer . it is a real nice crystal clear copper color , you can see every bubble in the glass . on top is a nice thick head . the head almost looks too heavy for the actual beer , a nice contrast .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear deep amber color . i could only muster 1/4 of a finger of beige head that fell almost instantly . 3.5	000000000000000000000000
1	a : the beer is a medium orange in color with a 2 finger fluffy white head that has excellent retention and lacing . the beer has minimal haziness to it and is nearly 100 % translucent	0000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : dark brown/burgundy , not much head action due to filtering .	0000000000000
0	a : unfiltered ? lots of nasties floating around when held up to the light .	0000000000000000
1	appearance : butte creek 's ipa sits in the glass a beautiful , brilliantly clear pale amber . the finger of dense white foam retains very nicely . butte creek has mastered the art of making a nice looking beer . now they just need to work on aroma , taste and mouthfeel .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : dark red-burnt orange body , medium head . the head is creamy and tan , leaves full lace .	000000000000000000000
0	a : pours clear orange , with a slight yellow tint on the stream out of the bottle . very short lasting white fizzy head , no lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : an aggressive pour gives me an inch head of fluffy off white foam on top of a mostly clear pale yellow orange beer . there are only a few bubbles rising to maintain the head , but it still sticks around for a while . there is some pretty thick lacing left on the glass after the head falls some .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a pitch black in the glass with the barest smidgen of mahogany translucence at the edges . a vigorous pour produces a fluffy , short-lived mocha head . as it disappears , it leaves nothing , not even a thin donut on the brew . there is no lacing .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : orange colour and a 2 cm head that lasts . 5	0000000000000
0	a : hazy copper orange body . no head even with a hard pour .	000000000000000
0	appearance : yellow , clear , fizzy yet thick , with a very small head and very bad retention .	00000000000000000000
1	a : how could this not be a 5 ? yeah , it 's got a nice red body with a good fluffy white head , but that 's not what does it . the can is awesome . that 's worth a 5 by itself .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : black pour with a nice light brown head . the creamy head forms wonderfully after the beer has been poured as i would expect from a nitro poured offering . 4.5	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : cloudy straw color with a thin white head	0000000000
0	a : no head at all . hazy light brown/orange look . really not good looking ...	00000000000000000
0	appearance : orange/gold , transparent liquid that was obviously filtered because of the clarity . 1 cm head that quickly dissipated leaving no trace . disappointing for a wheat beer where i expect huge heads .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a light-golden yellow hue , with a half-finger head that quickly dissipates into nothingness . no lacing is left . not impressed .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : one finger of white head over a pale golden , lightly-hazed beer . almost zero retention on the head , which made it less aesthetically appealing .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a copper body with a very small off-white head with extremely poor retention and no lacing .	00000000000000000000
1	appearance : dazzling orange-amber under light , with a foamy , frothy head .	00000000000000
1	a : this pours an absolutely transluscent , glowing , orange color with some red tint and an inch of foamy but rather thin head that does n't last long .	0000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : dark brown , almost maroon . light shows through and there is a very creamy head with good retention and lacing .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : very clear , nice head , dissapates fast , and no lacing .	000000000000000
0	a : light yellow , barely any head , dissipates fast .	000000000000
0	appearance : basically clear , even more clear than others	0000000000
0	a : pours a mostly clear , tawny golden-copper color . there is only a small , foamy head with minimal retention and scanty lacing .	00000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a dark murky root beer color with carbonation to match , only the head sets this apart as an actual beer .	0000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : golden brown , a little lighter than most amber belgium beers . when held up to the light , it turns a nice orange/red color . the bits of yeast floating in the beer is n't nearly as appetizing as the label makes it seem , but they are barely noticeable when drinking .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a light copper/almost a golden color with 2+ fingers of head . wow it has some carbonation to it .	00000000000000000000000
0	appearance : clear yellow with a small layer of lacing around the top .	00000000000000
1	a : a dark amber color with a dark tan head that almost matches . the transition in the glass from beer to froth is almost seamless , pretty impressive .	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : ( 2.0 ) - quite the heavy pour into a small rogue flute glass ( all i really have at the time being ) . pours a very dark cola brown with some slight off-white bubbly head.. only a paper thin layer which has pretty much vanished and left the smallest little ring around the perimeter of the brew . its a nice color , but shows a major lack of carbonation .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : straw/neon yellow color w/ two fingers of head . wow this is a light colored beer	000000000000000000
1	appearance : black as sin .	000000
1	a : a big english ale deserves a big english pint glass . poured lighter than i was expecting for whatever reason - i somehow put strong and dark together . a shimmering gold , with a great and sticky foam head . looks wonderful .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : poured a massive 1.5 fingered creamy head , in a tulip this appears huge . the color is a glorious tawny . the carbonation is rising nicely in the glass and it seems as if the head is hardly going anywhere . this head appears as it 's staying for the long haul and this head does .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dark brown color . a thin tan head forms and recedes in an instant . very little lace is left behind .	00000000000000000000000000
1	a : black as darkest night -- - i held it up to a light , and nothing passed through . if dark beers scare you , do n't go here ... otherwise though , it is a thing a beauty .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : bright , clear yellow/golden color.. little to no head or lacing .	00000000000000
0	a : served a very cloudy burnt pumpkin color with a quarter inch khaki head that slowly faded into a thin collar that left pretty good sheets of lacing down the glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : deep amber under a small tan head . no lace , no retention .	0000000000000000
1	a : its defianlty dark , but it 's not black . highlights of dark red can be seen as the glass sits on the dark wooden table . the head is a light tan , and stays in a thin layer on top of the liquid and leaves decent but spotty lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : half finger head of nice cream , fair thickness , and abysmal retention - but then again the abv is fairly high and i served it in a goblet . colour is a semitransparent copper-amber ( more amber ) . sm : lots of bright summer fruit ester hops help overcome the rough bittering hops . the bittering hops are still rampant , which turns me off ( i usually hate this style for that reason ) . the scent is mild in strength . i suppose objectively it 's appealing .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a nebulous reddish brown with a fast fading small head .	00000000000000
0	appearance : before tasting , flat brown . after the first taste , more like liquid dung .	000000000000000000
1	appearance : i must say by taking a look at it , its a very pretty orange/ honey color with minimal head ... so far so good .	0000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : the pour is a very cloudy cinnamon , saffron and amber color with a finger of head . the head retention is moderate . i ca n't see very far into the beer to see how effervescent it is . with every single pour i can see yeast just dumping out . it 's actually pretty surprising how much yeast is in this bottle . lace is for the most part non-existent .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : not much to describe really , pours a super viscous dark amber with hints of orange , entirely opaque , absolutely no head , looks like syrup in a glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a syrupy molasses-brown . a tiny head of cinnamon is a very late arrival , rising from the depths lazily . the top layer quickly fades to an almost unnoticeable ring .	00000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a nice dark copper color with that perfect nitro head and lace .	0000000000000000
0	a : dark brown under a very small off white head . no retention and no lace .	000000000000000000
1	a : pours very dark , almost pitch black with a nice tan head .	000000000000000
0	a : pours a pale , insipid yellow , really no head to speak of , coming out of the tap , there were just a smattering of bubbles .	000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : what the hell is going on here ? this is a belgian , this looks like a damn stout . opaque brown with a tan frothy head . borderline black with patchy lacing .	000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : very hazed pale yellow with hints of orange . head is massive , billows out of the glass . good retention and lacing .	00000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours a dark chestnut hue with just no head . no noticeable carbonation or lace .	000000000000000000
0	appearance : murky reddish brown , very little white head , no lacing .	00000000000000
1	a : poured into a room-temp pint glass , bass presents quite beautifully with a white foamy head the width of 1 1/2 fingers atop a dark copper body -- almost bronze -- with glassy clarity . the head settles quickly , leaving a thin layer of foam across the surface . lacing sticks to the glass in strata as you drink it down .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : a hard pour gave me about three fingers of sturdy looking off-white foam . the body is a clear well-carbonated orange . similar in color to an oktoberfest , i suppose . good lacing and head retention .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours dark as heck with a solid 1 '' plus head that is two layers ... a bubbly active bottom layer next to the beer and then a creamy cap sitting on top that looks completely still if you were looking down on it ... thank heavens for glass glasses , eh ? the head appears to have grown a bit in the first couple minutes after the pour . after drinking there are solid islands of lace left all over the glass . it is a nice looking beer , no doubt .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : pours a coppery color with some hints of amber in it and starts with a 1/2 finger off-white head that fades quickly to nothing at all , not even a ring around the surface ; the body has a little bit of haze and shows moderately strong carbonation in spots , and weaker carbonation in others ; no lacing is left behind at all .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : great stout , dark brown color with a coffee colored head .	00000000000000
0	a : the pour is about what you 'd expect from a beer like this : light yellow in color with a fluffy white head that dies quickly .	00000000000000000000000000000
0	a : looks like a beer : check ! seriously though , the beer is golden with a slight yellow tinge . the 2cm ( that 's almost an inch to our american/british readers ) head dissapated so quickly i could n't have timed it . oh well - points off for that .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : clear golden-yellow color with a huge white and creamy head . good retention . leaves some lacings as it disappears	0000000000000000000000
0	a : very pale yellow with literally no head or lacing at all .	00000000000000
1	a : it pours yellow to golden with a large creamy head that leaves great lacings when it dissipates .	00000000000000000000
0	appearance : a very hazy , earthy copper tone with minimal , fine white head that dissipates quickly , but a ring of foam remained at the glass/beer interface of my st. bernardus goblet throughout the session . unexceptional .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : hazy and somewhat cloudy yellow ... a decent head .	000000000000
0	a : a silky waterfall of black liquid pours an opaque body with a small dark tanned head that dessipates quickly .	0000000000000000000000
0	a : the cork slid out of the bottle with a sickly , barely audible `` pop '' . first uh-oh . i poured the first glass and got absolutely no head . second uh-oh . i slammed the beer into the second glass and got just the barest minimum of fizzy foam that disappeared immediately . third uh-oh . what was left was a murky cola brown with no head , lace , or carbonation .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : this is a real beauty . pours a very deep , hazy , orangish amber . huge , thick , fluffy white head fills a big portion of the glass , and takes forever to dissipate . even once it deflates , in never completely disappears . the color is gorgeous , but the head really does it -- one of the best i 've ever seen .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : pours a wonderfully bright golden/orange color . a large pillowing white head forms that gently recedes to leave a bunch of sticky spiderweb lace .	000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : at first an interesting cascading carbonation effect that is associated with nitro-taps . after that there is a truly creamy and sustaining light tan head of roughly a quarter-inch . impressively , the head sustains throughout the whole time i was drinking the beer ( wow ! ) . the beer is almost entirely black in color with some very dark ruby hues coming through as well .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : my glass had minimal head , and poor lacing but a nice light orange color . i might attribute the head to the bartender .	000000000000000000000000000
1	appearance : pours a transparent golden color with lots of flowing carbonation . the head is white and rises 1 '' tall , showing a good amount of foaminess and retention . a coating of lace remains behind . nice !	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : amber color has good clarity and minimal carbonation . off white head is a little fizzy , but has great retention and leaves heavy lace .	0000000000000000000000000000
1	a : ruby red , trending towards `` light brown '' , with a pleasant 1-fingers worth off-white head on top that stuck around well and left nice lacing on my glass .	000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pours red-brown , with slight haze and a light haze that quickly drops to nothing .	000000000000000000
1	a : this beer has a excellent dark chocolate/coffee color with a 1 '' head that disappears slowly .	0000000000000000000
1	appearance : cloudy golden yellow with an amazing , big , billowy head that last all the way through the beer , incredible lacing too which sticks all over the glass . this is the only beer i 've ever had which could rival duvel in appearance . the best looking tripel i 've ever seen .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark cranberry or blood red color . opaque . pink thin head .	000000000000000
0	appearance : a bit worrisome at first ; very light , green glass bottle , from which pours a very pale beer . carbonation is nice and the head is dense and plush , but it fades quickly . it looks good , but pretty run of the mill .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : a murky , iced tea colour ... not much head at all , and whatever was there did n't stick around long .	0000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : golden amber with small cuspish of head . kinda average to say the least	0000000000000000
0	a : hard to score this one . i poured very carefully , but i just could n't keep the yeasty particulate out of the glass . i only emptied a little over half of the bottle , yet the glass absolutely polluted with suspended yeast chunks . i 'm not squeamish about this sort of thing . it just does n't look very nice . the color was a dark gold with amber highlights . my careful pour did not allow for a head to form .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0	a : pale yellow clear , and nice head .	0000000000
0	a : cloudy pale orange body with practically no head - just a few white bubbles around the extreme edge . disappointing .	00000000000000000000000
0	appearance : brown with a thin head that dissapates quickly . not completly clear but lacking haze	00000000000000000
1	a : pitch black with a 1 finger foam head . exactly how a stout should look .	000000000000000000
1	a : clear amber in color with some minimal sediment . good foamy head with decent amount of lacing .	00000000000000000000
1	a : looking very decent and nice -- light amber hue , with a tight , foamy white beer head with extremely good retention and looking very fizzy ...	00000000000000000000000000000

1	a : my antonia pours a lovely straw/amber hue and is marked by a monstrous head of the consistency of whipped egg whites . the real winner is the lacing , with a tornado of pinhead bubbles spiraling from the laser etching on my glass . definitely appealing ... .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : from the first pour i was shocked how much lighter this was then what i expected . its really more a dark brown than a black . i can even see light through the bottom of the glass . smallest of heads formed but seems to be hanging out .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

1	a : poured from a 12 oz . bottle into a large hennepin glass . the fluid is dark caramelly clear with a huge three finger head of off white , which eventually receded to a half finger width with lacing still attached to the glass . a tiny bit of sediment was left in the bottle	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : the perfect clear orange color . about an inch and a half of head . great retention . thick tan foam .	000000000000000000000000
1	a : humbling deep mahogany with amber edges . frothy and bubbly 1/2 '' head forms and fades away slowly , but never really going away . gorgeous color , impressive head . n : semlls like a volume produced dark lager ( even if it is an ale ) . very faint hints of malt , a suggestion of vanilla and general beer-ness , but not a lot to speak of . a letdown after the strong appearance . p/m : heavy and strong carbonation overwhelms and wipes what nuances might be there completely away ( taking note that there might not be any there at all ) , thus making the palate and mouthfeel fairly weak and mostly effervescent . tones of tobacco , cinnamon , apricots in syrup , caramel , cheap toothpicks , and , perhaps , pavement . edgy but not in a rewarding or innovative way . all hopes for this brew are dashed by the damn overzealous carbonation and slick/clean/crisp mouthfeel , which leaves positively no finish . a clean break at the end for sure , but that 's not what i want to match the flavors . getting further into the mug , this beer tastes like boston ale that was drawn off a dirty tap line and consumed after someone dropped a lit cigar and a couple of werther 's originals into it . a farce . point dockage for failure to do anything new when yet again s.a. had the chance .	0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	a : poured into my snifter with a minimal amount of head , which quickly receded and left only a scant ring around the rim and no lacing . the light amber color almost resembled a nice cognac , aside for the few flakes floating around , which i guess could be bacon .	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	a : dark , just how i like them , but man what an awful beer . good head retention . i was hoping for more .	000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : well , the can is white with the obligatory blue ribbon . if i wanted to pour it into a glass it would probably be pale and watery looking	0000000000000000000000000000000
0	appearance : looks like urine no head exept when you first pour it	0000000000000
1	appearance : poured into a standard pint glass with a solid two-finger head . this looks rich and foamy , arrogance possibly ? the head holds fast for a while , and as it disappears , it leaves a ton of lacing . `` do n't forget me . '' the beer pours a dark red that 's almost opaque , but it lets light through in all the right places as if screaming , `` look at me . i 'm a beer to behold . drink and be merry ! ''	000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

0	appearance : given the appearance of the label , i do n't know why i was surprised at first pour . it pours a translucent red that reminds me of strawberry soda . the theme carries over upon first sight of the pink head that quickly diminishes . if pepto bismol had a head , it might look similar to this . great start .	00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
